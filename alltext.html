<p>In 2154, humans have depleted <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>'s natural resources, leading to a severe energy crisis. The Resources Development Administration (RDA for short) mines for a valuable mineral — <a href="/wiki/Unobtainium" title="Unobtainium">unobtanium</a> — on Pandora, a densely forested <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Habitable_moon" title="Habitable moon">habitable moon</a> orbiting the <a href="/wiki/Gas_giant" title="Gas giant">gas giant</a> Polyphemus in the <a href="/wiki/Alpha_Centauri" title="Alpha Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a> star system.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Horwitz2009_11-1"><a href="#cite_note-Horwitz2009-11">[11]</a></sup> Pandora, whose atmosphere is poisonous to humans, is inhabited by the <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere#Naʼvi" title="Pandoran biosphere">Na'vi</a>, a species of 10-foot tall (3.0 m), blue-skinned, <a href="/wiki/Wisdom" title="Wisdom">sapient</a> humanoids<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> that live in harmony with nature and worship a <a href="/wiki/Mother_goddess" title="Mother goddess">mother goddess</a> named Eywa.
</p><p>To explore <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere" title="Pandoran biosphere">Pandora's biosphere</a>, scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called "avatars", operated by genetically matched humans; Jake Sully, a paraplegic former <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_Marine" title="United States Marine">Marine</a>, replaces his deceased identical twin brother as an operator of one. Dr. Grace Augustine, head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement but accepts his assignment as a bodyguard. While protecting the avatars of Grace and fellow scientist Dr. Norm Spellman as they collect biological data, Jake's avatar is attacked by a <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere#Fauna" title="Pandoran biosphere">thanator</a> and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Witnessing an auspicious sign, she takes him to her clan, whereupon Neytiri's mother Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Colonel" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's <a href="/wiki/Private_military_company" title="Private military company">private security force</a>, promises Jake that the company will restore his legs if he gathers information about the Na'vi and the clan's gathering place, a giant tree called Hometree,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Script25_36-0"><a href="#cite_note-Script25-36">[36]</a></sup> which stands above the richest deposit of unobtanium in the area. When Grace learns of this, she transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/outpost" title="wikt:outpost">outpost</a>. Over the following three months, Jake grows to sympathize with the natives. After Jake is initiated into the tribe, he and Neytiri choose each other as mates, and soon afterward, Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he attempts to disable a bulldozer that threatens to destroy a sacred Na'vi site. When Quaritch shows a video recording of Jake's attack on the bulldozer to Administrator Parker Selfridge,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Script8and15_37-0"><a href="#cite_note-Script8and15-37">[37]</a></sup> and another in which Jake admits that the Na'vi will never abandon Hometree, Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed.
</p><p>Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biological_neural_network" title="Biological neural network">biological neural network</a> native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate before commencing the attack. While trying to warn the Na'vi, Jake confesses to being a spy, and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Seeing this, Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, frees Jake and Grace and airlifts them to Grace's outpost, but during the escape Quaritch fires at them, hitting Grace.
</p><p>To regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fictional_universe_in_Avatar#The_Tree_of_Souls" title="Fictional universe in Avatar">Tree of Souls</a> and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can be completed. Supported by the new chief Tsu'tey, Jake speaks to unite the clan and tells them to gather all of the clans to battle against the RDA. Noticing the impending gathering, Quaritch organizes a <a href="/wiki/Preemptive_war" title="Preemptive war">pre-emptive strike</a> against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives. On the eve of battle, Jake prays to Eywa, via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na'vi.
</p><p>During the subsequent battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy; but are rescued when <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Characters_and_wildlife_in_Avatar#Fauna" title="Characters and wildlife in Avatar">Pandoran wildlife</a> unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch, wearing an <a href="/wiki/Mecha" title="Mecha">AMP suit</a>, escapes from his own damaged aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation.
</p><p>With the exceptions of Jake, Norm and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora and sent back to Earth, after which Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.
</p><p>In 1996, treasure hunter Brock Lovett and his team aboard the research vessel <i><a href="/wiki/Akademik_Mstislav_Keldysh" title="Akademik Mstislav Keldysh">Akademik Mstislav Keldysh</a></i> search the wreck of RMS <i>Titanic</i> for a necklace with a rare diamond, the <a href="/wiki/Heart_of_the_Ocean" title="Heart of the Ocean">Heart of the Ocean</a>. They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[Note 1]</a></sup> Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard <i>Keldysh</i> and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard <i>Titanic</i>.
</p><p>In 1912 <a href="/wiki/Southampton" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>, 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fiancé Cal Hockley, and her mother Ruth board the luxurious <i>Titanic</i>. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve their family's financial problems and retain their high-class persona. Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class.
</p><p>Aware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cal's bodyguard, Mr. Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with an iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.
</p><p>Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Lovejoy slips the necklace into Jack's pocket and he and Cal accuse him of theft. Jack is arrested, taken to the <a href="/wiki/Master-at-arms" title="Master-at-arms">master-at-arms</a>' office, and handcuffed to a pipe. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.
</p><p>With the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.
</p><p>After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for only one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of <a href="/wiki/Hypothermia" title="Hypothermia">hypothermia</a><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Carlson_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Carlson-9">[8]</a></sup> but Rose is saved.
</p><p>With Rose hiding from Cal en route, the <a href="/wiki/RMS_Carpathia" title="RMS Carpathia">RMS <i>Carpathia</i></a> takes the survivors to New York City where Rose gives her name as Rose Dawson. Rose says she later read that Cal committed suicide after losing all his money in the <a href="/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929" title="Wall Street Crash of 1929">Wall Street Crash of 1929</a>.
</p><p>Back in the present, Lovett decides to abandon his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of <i>Keldysh</i>, Rose takes out the Heart of the Ocean – in her possession all along – and drops it into the sea over the wreck site.

Agent <a href="/wiki/Phil_Coulson" title="Phil Coulson">Phil Coulson</a> explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a <a href="/wiki/Wormhole" title="Wormhole">wormhole</a>, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a few other agents, including <a href="/wiki/Hawkeye_(comics)" title="Hawkeye (comics)">Clint Barton</a>, to aid him in his getaway.
</p><p>In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the "<a href="/wiki/Avengers_(comics)" title="Avengers (comics)">Avengers Initiative</a>". Agent <a href="/wiki/Black_Widow_(Natasha_Romanova)" title="Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)">Natasha Romanoff</a> is sent to <a href="/wiki/Kolkata" title="Kolkata">Calcutta</a> to recruit <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Banner_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)" title="Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)">Dr. Bruce Banner</a> to trace the Tesseract through its <a href="/wiki/Gamma_ray" title="Gamma ray">gamma radiation</a> emissions.

</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Stuttgart" title="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>, Barton steals <a href="/wiki/Iridium" title="Iridium">iridium</a> needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., <a href="/wiki/Thor_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)" title="Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)">Thor</a>, his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the <a href="/wiki/Helicarrier" title="Helicarrier">Helicarrier</a>. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.
</p><p>The Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk falls to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above <a href="/wiki/Stark_Tower" title="Stark Tower">Stark Tower</a> to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.
</p><p>Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's location. Banner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians. The Hulk finds Loki and beats him into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at <a href="/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan" title="Midtown Manhattan">Midtown Manhattan</a>. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed.

Meanwhile, Owen's older brother, Deckard Shaw, breaks into the secure hospital that the comatose Owen is being held in and swears vengeance against Dom and his team, before breaking into Luke Hobbs' <a href="/wiki/Diplomatic_Security_Service" title="Diplomatic Security Service">Diplomatic Security Service</a> (DSS) office to extract profiles of Dom's crew. After revealing his identity, Shaw engages Hobbs in a fight, and escapes when he detonates a bomb that severely injures Hobbs.

</p><p>Back at Han's funeral in <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, Dom notices a car observing them, and after a chase, confronts its driver, who is revealed to be Shaw.

With God's Eye near <a href="/wiki/Repeater" title="Repeater">telecommunications repeaters</a>, the team tracks down Shaw, who is waiting at a remote factory. Dom, Brian, Nobody and his team attempt to capture Shaw, but are ambushed by Jakande and his men and forced to flee while Jakande obtains God's Eye. At his own request, the injured Nobody is left behind to be evacuated by helicopter while Brian and Dom continue without him. To reduce their disadvantage, the crew returns to Los Angeles to fight Shaw, Jakande and his men. Meanwhile, Brian promises Mia that once they deal with Shaw, he will retire and fully dedicate himself to their family.

Brian engages Jakande's henchman Kiet and throws him down an elevator shaft before hijacking a signal repeater tower, allowing Ramsey to regain control of God's Eye and shut it down. Dom and Shaw engage in a one-on-one brawl on top of a public parking garage, before Jakande intervenes and attacks them both. Shaw is defeated when part of the parking garage collapses beneath him. Dom then launches his vehicle at Jakande's helicopter, tossing Shaw's bag of grenades onto its skids, before injuring himself when his car lands and crashes. Hobbs then shoots the bag of grenades from ground level, destroying the helicopter and killing Jakande. Dom is pulled from the wreckage of his car, believed to be dead. As Letty cradles Dom's body in her arms, she reveals that she has regained her memories, and that she remembers their wedding. Dom regains consciousness soon after, remarking, "It's about time".

Escaping with the scepter, Ultron uses the resources in Strucker's Sokovia base to upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot drones. Having killed Strucker, he recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for their parents' deaths by his company's weapons, and goes to the base of arms dealer <a href="/wiki/Klaw_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Klaw (Marvel Comics)">Ulysses Klaue</a> in <a href="/wiki/Johannesburg" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a> to obtain <a href="/wiki/Wakanda" title="Wakanda">Wakandan</a> <a href="/wiki/Vibranium" title="Vibranium">vibranium</a>.

As Ultron uploads himself into the body, Wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn against Ultron. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff.
</p><p>The Avengers fight amongst themselves when Stark secretly uploads J.A.R.V.I.S.—who is still operational after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet—into the synthetic body.

He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of <a href="/wiki/Wakanda" title="Wakanda">Wakanda</a>. Over centuries, the Wakandans use the vibranium to develop advanced technology and isolate themselves from the world by posing as a <a href="/wiki/Third_World" title="Third World">Third World</a> country.

At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader <a href="/wiki/Man-Ape" title="Man-Ape">M'Baku</a> challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat. T'Challa defeats M'Baku and persuades him to yield rather than die.

Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue as Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him.
</p><p>While Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, the latter attacked Zuri and forced T'Chaka to kill him. T'Chaka ordered Zuri to lie that N'Jobu had disappeared and left behind N'Jobu's American son in order to maintain the lie. This boy grew up to be Stevens, a U.S. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Black_ops" title="Black ops">black ops</a> soldier who adopted the name "Killmonger". Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity to be N'Jadaka and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat, where he kills Zuri, defeats T'Challa, and hurls him over a waterfall to his presumed death. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first. Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.
</p><p>Nakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit. W'Kabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down planes carrying the vibranium weapons. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated.

Harry also learns that Dumbledore was dying and wished for Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe he saw in the woods that led him to the sword was conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him; he must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within him. Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort in the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts#Forbidden_Forest" title="Hogwarts">Forbidden Forest</a>. Voldemort casts the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Avada_Kedavra" title="Avada Kedavra">Killing Curse</a> upon Harry, who finds himself in <a href="/wiki/Limbo" title="Limbo">limbo</a>. Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's curse. Harry returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort.

As Neville gives a defiant response and draws the sword from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sorting_Hat" title="Sorting Hat">Sorting Hat</a>, Harry reveals he is still alive; the Malfoys and many <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> abandon Voldemort. While Harry confronts Voldemort in a duel throughout the castle, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Molly_Weasley" title="Molly Weasley">Molly Weasley</a> kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall and Neville decapitates Nagini, making Voldemort mortal. Harry and Voldemort's fight ends with Voldemort's own Killing Curse rebounding and obliterating him. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that the Elder Wand recognised him as its true master after he disarmed Draco, who had earlier disarmed its previous owner, Dumbledore. Harry destroys the Elder Wand rather than claim it.
</p><p>Nineteen years later, Harry, <a href="/wiki/Ginny_Weasley" title="Ginny Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a>, Ron, Hermione, and Draco proudly watch their own children leave for Hogwarts at <a href="/wiki/London_King%27s_Cross_railway_station" title="London King's Cross railway station">King's Cross station</a>.

Unbeknownst to Luke, Rey and Kylo communicate through the Force, puzzling the two enemies. As Rey and Kylo learn about each other, both have visions of themselves as future partners.
</p><p>R2-D2 persuades Luke to train Rey. After Kylo tells Rey what happened between him and Luke that caused him to choose the dark side, Luke confesses that he momentarily contemplated killing Kylo upon sensing that <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Leader_Snoke" title="Supreme Leader Snoke">Supreme Leader Snoke</a> was corrupting him, causing Kylo to destroy Luke's new Jedi Order in retaliation. Convinced that Kylo can be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To without Luke. Luke prepares to burn the Ahch-To Jedi temple and library, but hesitates. <a href="/wiki/Yoda" title="Yoda">Yoda</a>'s ghost appears and destroys the temple by summoning a bolt of <a href="/wiki/Lightning" title="Lightning">lightning</a>, claiming Rey has all she needs to learn, and encourages Luke to learn from his failure.
</p><p>Holdo reveals her plan to discreetly evacuate the remaining Resistance members using small transports. Believing her actions cowardly and risky, Poe leads a mutiny. Finn, Rose, and BB-8 travel to the Canto Bight casino and acquire the help of the hacker <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/DJ_(Star_Wars)" title="DJ (Star Wars)">DJ</a>. They infiltrate Snoke's ship, where all but BB-8 are captured by <a href="/wiki/Captain_Phasma" title="Captain Phasma">Captain Phasma</a>. Meanwhile, Rey lands on the ship, and Kylo brings her to Snoke, who says he facilitated the mental connection between her and Kylo as part of a plan to destroy Luke. Ordered to kill Rey, Kylo instead kills Snoke and defeats Snoke's guards alongside Rey. Rey believes that Kylo has returned to the light side of the Force, but he instead invites her to rule the galaxy with him. Refusing, she fights Kylo for possession of <a href="/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Anakin Skywalker</a>'s lightsaber, which splits in two.
</p><p>Leia recovers and stuns Poe, allowing the evacuation to begin.

DJ reveals the Resistance's plan to the First Order, and the evacuation transports are slowly destroyed. Holdo sacrifices herself by ramming Snoke's fleet at lightspeed; Rey escapes in the chaos, while Kylo declares himself Supreme Leader. BB-8 frees Finn and Rose, who escape after defeating Phasma, and join the survivors on Crait. When the First Order arrives, Poe, Finn, and Rose attack with old speeders. Rey and Chewbacca draw the TIE fighters away with the <i>Falcon</i>, while Rose stops Finn from completing a suicide run against the enemy siege cannon, which subsequently penetrates the Resistance fortress.
</p><p>Luke appears and confronts the First Order to enable surviving Resistance members to escape. Kylo orders the First Order's forces to fire on Luke, to no effect. He then engages Luke in a lightsaber duel; upon striking Luke, Kylo realizes he has been fighting a Force projection of him. Rey uses the Force to help the Resistance escape on the <i>Falcon</i>. Luke, exhausted, becomes one with the Force and dies peacefully on Ahch-To. Rey and Leia sense his death, and Leia tells surviving rebels that the Resistance has all it needs to rise again. At Canto Bight, one of the children who helped Finn and Rose escape grabs a broom with the Force and gazes into space.

Mathematician <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Dr._Ian_Malcolm" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Dr. Ian Malcolm</a> testifies that the dinosaurs should be allowed to perish to correct <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#John_Hammond" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">John Hammond</a>'s mistake of <a href="/wiki/Cloning" title="Cloning">cloning</a> them. Meanwhile, Jurassic World's former operations manager, Claire Dearing, has established the Dinosaur Protection Group to save the animals. After the Senate rules against rescuing the dinosaurs, Hammond's former partner, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Sir_Benjamin_Lockwood" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Benjamin Lockwood</a>, summons Claire to his <a href="/wiki/Northern_California" title="Northern California">Northern California</a> estate. Lockwood and his aide, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Eli_Mills" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Eli Mills</a>, reveal a plan to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary. Claire is needed to help reactivate the park's dinosaur <a href="/wiki/GPS_wildlife_tracking" title="GPS wildlife tracking">tracking system</a> to locate the animals, particularly Blue, the last surviving <i><a href="/wiki/Velociraptor" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a></i>. Although they are estranged, Claire recruits Jurassic World's former <i>Velociraptor</i> trainer and Blue's alpha, Owen Grady, to help capture her.
</p><p>On Isla Nublar, Claire and former park technician <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Franklin_Webb" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Franklin Webb</a> reactivate the online <a href="/wiki/GPS_wildlife_tracking" title="GPS wildlife tracking">tracking system</a>. Owen, paleo-veterinarian <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Dr._Zia_Rodriguez" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Zia Rodriguez</a>, and a mercenary team led by <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Ken_Wheatley" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Ken Wheatley</a> search for and find Blue. The encounter escalates, resulting in a mercenary soldier shooting Blue, and Wheatley <a href="/wiki/Sedative" title="Sedative">tranquilizing</a> Owen. The mercenaries take Zia with them to treat Blue's injury. The mercenary ship, loaded with the captured dinosaurs, departs for the <a href="/wiki/Contiguous_United_States" title="Contiguous United States">U.S. mainland</a> as the dinosaurs left behind die in the eruption. Claire, Franklin, and Owen sneak aboard in time and assist Zia in <a href="/wiki/Blood_transfusion" title="Blood transfusion">transfusing</a> Blue with <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> blood. The group now realize that the captured dinosaurs were never being transported to a new island and are for another purpose.
</p><p>At the estate, Lockwood's orphaned pre-teen granddaughter <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Maisie_Lockwood" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Maisie</a> overhears Mills and auctioneer <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Gunnar_Eversol" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Gunnar Eversol</a> secretly planning to auction the captured dinosaurs on the <a href="/wiki/Black_market" title="Black market">black market</a>.

Wu wants Blue's DNA to create an enhanced <i>Indoraptor</i>, unaware that Blue's blood is contaminated. After Maisie informs Lockwood about the auction, he confronts Mills, who murders him. Maisie is later revealed to have been cloned from Lockwood's deceased daughter and is the reason John Hammond, who opposed <a href="/wiki/Human_cloning" title="Human cloning">human cloning</a>, ended their association.
</p><p>The dinosaurs are transported to Lockwood's estate and caged. Zia and Franklin narrowly evade capture, but Owen and Claire are apprehended and confined. Owen incites a <i><a href="/wiki/Stygimoloch" title="Stygimoloch">Stygimoloch</a></i> into breaking open their cell. They find Maisie, who leads them to the auction where the <i>Indoraptor</i> is being sold despite Wu's protests that it is a prototype. Owen disrupts the proceedings by luring the <i>Stygimoloch</i> into the room. In the ensuing chaos, Wheatley tranquilizes the <i>Indoraptor</i> to extract a tooth as a trophy, but it feigns sedation and kills Wheatley, Eversol, and others as it escapes. The <i>Indoraptor</i> hunts Owen, Claire, and Maisie throughout the mansion. Zia releases Blue, who attacks the <i>Indoraptor</i>, causing it to fall through a glass roof to its death.
</p><p>When a <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_cyanide" title="Hydrogen cyanide">hydrogen cyanide</a> gas leak threatens the caged dinosaurs, Maisie frees them, despite Owen's objections. Mills attempts to flee with the <i>Indominus rex</i> bone but is devoured by the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, which tramples the bone. Owen, Claire, Maisie, Zia, and Franklin safely escape, while Blue and the other released dinosaurs flee the estate grounds.

</p><p>Princess <a href="/wiki/Elsa_(Frozen)" title="Elsa (Frozen)">Elsa</a> of Arendelle possesses paranormal powers that allows her to control and create ice and snow, often using it to play with her younger sister, <a href="/wiki/Anna_(Frozen)" title="Anna (Frozen)">Anna</a>. After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents, the King and Queen, take both siblings to a colony of trolls led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna, but alters her memories to remove traces of Elsa's magic, warning Elsa that she must learn to control her powers. The King and Queen isolate both sisters within the castle. Elsa shuts Anna out, causing a rift between them. Unable to control it, Elsa can only suppress her power, causing her to  become more insecure. When the sisters are teenagers, their parents die at sea during a storm.
</p><p>When Elsa turns 21, she is to be crowned queen of Arendelle. She is terrified that the kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear her. The castle gates open to the public and visiting dignitaries for the first time in years. Among them is the scheming Duke of Weselton and the dashing <a href="/wiki/Hans_(Frozen)" title="Hans (Frozen)">Prince Hans</a> of the Southern Isles, the latter of whom Anna falls in love with <a href="/wiki/Love_at_first_sight" title="Love at first sight">at first sight</a>. Elsa's <a href="/wiki/Coronation" title="Coronation">coronation</a> happens without a hitch, but she still remains distant from Anna. When Hans proposes to Anna, Elsa objects, accidentally unleashing her powers before the court; the Duke brands her a monster. Elsa flees to the North Mountain, where she builds a palace of ice in which to live a <a href="/wiki/Hermit" title="Hermit">hermit</a> life. In the process, however, her suppressed magic engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter.
</p><p>Anna ventures out to find Elsa and end the winter, leaving Hans in command. She gets lost, collecting supplies at Wandering Oaken's shop. She meets an <a href="/wiki/Iceman_(occupation)" title="Iceman (occupation)">ice harvester</a> named <a href="/wiki/Kristoff_(Frozen)" title="Kristoff (Frozen)">Kristoff</a> and his <a href="/wiki/Reindeer" title="Reindeer">reindeer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sven_(Frozen)" title="Sven (Frozen)">Sven</a>, convincing them to take her to the mountains.

On foot, they meet <a href="/wiki/Olaf_(Frozen)" title="Olaf (Frozen)">Olaf</a>, a cheerful <a href="/wiki/Snowman" title="Snowman">snowman</a> brought to life unknowingly by Elsa, who offers to lead them to her. When Anna's horse returns to Arendelle, Hans sets out to find Anna and Elsa, accompanied by the Duke's minions, who have secret orders to kill Elsa.
</p><p>Reaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa, but when she reveals what has become of Arendelle, Elsa becomes upset, saying that she cannot undo it, and accidentally freezes Anna's heart. She then makes a giant snow monster named Marshmallow, who chases Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf away. Anna's hair begins turning white, so Kristoff takes her to meet the trolls, his adoptive family. Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless "an act of true love" reverses the spell. Kristoff races Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss. Hans and his men reach Elsa's palace, defeating Marshmallow and capturing Elsa. Anna is delivered to Hans but, rather than kissing her, Hans instead reveals that he has actually been plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters. Hans locks Anna in a room to die, and then manipulates the dignitaries into believing that Elsa killed her. He orders the queen's execution, only to discover she has escaped her detention cell.
</p><p>Olaf frees Anna, and they venture into the <a href="/wiki/Blizzard" title="Blizzard">blizzard</a> outside to meet Kristoff, whom Olaf reveals is in love with her. Hans confronts Elsa outside, claiming that she killed Anna, causing Elsa to break down. Anna spots Hans about to kill Elsa; she leaps in the way and freezes solid, stopping Hans. Devastated, Elsa hugs and mourns over her sister, who <a href="/wiki/Thaw_(weather)" title="Thaw (weather)">thaws</a> out, her heroism constituting "an act of true love". Realizing that love is the key to controlling her magic, Elsa ends the winter and gives Olaf his own snow flurry to survive the warmer climate. Both Hans and the Duke are arrested and exiled from the kingdom. Anna gives Kristoff a new sleigh, and the two kiss. Both sisters are reunited and Elsa promises never to lock the castle gates again.
</p><p>A beautiful enchantress disguised as an old beggar woman arrives at a French castle during a ball and offers the host, a cruel and selfish prince, a rose in return for shelter from a storm. When he refuses, she reveals her identity. To punish the prince for his lack of compassion, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects, then erases the castle, the prince and his servants from the memories of their loved ones (in the small town of Villeneuve nearby). She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that if he learns to love another, and earn their love in return before the last petal falls, then the spell will be broken. If not, he will remain a beast forever.
</p><p>Some years later, at Villeneuve, Belle, the book-loving daughter of a <a href="/wiki/Music_box" title="Music box">music box</a> maker and artist, Maurice, dreams of adventure and brushes off advances from Gaston, an arrogant former soldier. On his way to a convention and lost in the forest, Maurice seeks refuge in the Beast's castle warming himself near the fire then being scared away by Chip after having some food, but the Beast imprisons him for stealing a rose from his garden as a gift to Belle. When Maurice's horse returns without him, Belle ventures out in search for him, and finds him locked in the castle dungeon. The Beast agrees to let her take Maurice's place.
</p><p>Belle befriends the castle's servants, who invite her to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the Beast scares her into the woods. She is ambushed by a pack of wolves, but the Beast rescues her, and is injured in the process. As Belle nurses his wounds, a friendship develops between them, also he shows her his library and gives it to her which makes her feel a different way towards the Beast unlike before. The Beast shows Belle a gift from the enchantress, a book that transports readers wherever they want. Belle uses the book to visit her childhood home in Paris, where she discovers a <a href="/wiki/Plague_doctor_costume" title="Plague doctor costume">plague doctor mask</a> and realizes that she and her father were forced to leave when her mother succumbed to the <a href="/wiki/Bubonic_plague" title="Bubonic plague">plague</a>.
</p><p>In Villeneuve, Maurice tries to convince the other villagers of the Beast and Belle's imprisonment but no one believes him. Gaston, seeing rescuing Belle as an opportunity to win her hand in marriage, agrees to help Maurice. When Maurice learns of his ulterior motive and rejects him, Gaston abandons him to be eaten by the wolves. Maurice is rescued by the hermit Agathe, but when he tells the townsfolk of Gaston's crime and is unable to provide solid evidence, Gaston convinces them to send Maurice to an insane asylum.
</p><p>After sharing a romantic dance with the Beast, Belle discovers her father's predicament using a magic mirror. The Beast places Belle's happiness before his own releases her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror to remember him with leaving him and his servants heartbroken. At Villeneuve, Belle reveals the Beast in the mirror to the townsfolk, proving her father's sanity. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, a jealous Gaston claims she has been charmed by dark magic, and has her thrown into the asylum carriage with her father. He rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to slay the Beast before he curses the whole village. Maurice and Belle escape, and Belle rushes back to the castle.
</p><p>During the battle, Gaston abandons his companion LeFou, who then sides with the servants to fend off the villagers. Gaston attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too heartbroken from Belle's departure to fight back, but regains his spirit upon seeing Belle return. He defeats Gaston, but spares his life before reuniting with Belle. Ungrateful and unrepentant, Gaston mortally wounds the Beast with a gunshot from a bridge, but it collapses when the castle crumbles, and he falls to his death. The injured Beast tells Belle that he was happy to see her again then he dies in her arms as the last petal falls, and the servants become inanimate. Belle tearfully professes her love to the Beast, Agathe reveals herself as the enchantress and undoes the curse, repairing the crumbling castle, and reviving the Beast then turning him and his servants' human making the villagers' remember their loved ones. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the villagers, where they dance happily.

Though they prevent the destruction of City Hall, they are unable to stop him from robbing a bank and escaping. The collateral damage caused by the incident outrages the government and prompts them to shut down the Superhero Relocation Program, leaving the Parrs without financial assistance. <a href="/wiki/Violet_Parr" title="Violet Parr">Violet</a>'s love interest <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Incredibles_characters#Tony_Rydinger" title="List of The Incredibles characters">Tony Rydinger</a> also discovers her superhero identity, forcing agent <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Incredibles_characters#Rick_Dicker" title="List of The Incredibles characters">Rick Dicker</a> to erase his memory.

He and his sister <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Incredibles_characters#Evelyn_Deavor" title="List of The Incredibles characters">Evelyn</a> propose sending the heroes on secret missions which will be recorded and publicized to regain public trust in superheroes.
</p><p>Due to Mr. Incredible's tendency to accidentally cause collateral damage, Winston chooses Elastigirl for the initial missions. While Elastigirl is away, Bob struggles with his new role as a stay-at-home parent: <a href="/wiki/Dash_Parr" title="Dash Parr">Dash</a> has trouble with math homework, Violet becomes withdrawn after Tony unintentionally fails to show up at their date due to his memory wipe, and <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Incredibles_characters#Jack-Jack_Parr" title="List of The Incredibles characters">Jack-Jack</a> wreaks havoc with his burgeoning superpowers. Bob brings Jack-Jack to <a href="/wiki/Edna_Mode" title="Edna Mode">Edna Mode</a>, who develops a suit that controls his abilities, allowing Bob to relax from his parenting difficulties. Meanwhile, on her missions, Elastigirl encounters a mysterious supervillain called the Screenslaver, who projects <a href="/wiki/Hypnosis" title="Hypnosis">hypnotic</a> images using television screens. She tracks him down to his hideout in an apartment building, and unmasks him as a deliveryman with no recollection of his actions.
</p><p>At a party celebrating the Screenslaver's arrest, Winston announces a summit of world leaders to legalize superheroes, hosted aboard his luxury yacht. Unsettled by the ease with which she captured the Screenslaver, Elastigirl realizes that he was controlled by a pair of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mind_control" title="Mind control">mind-control</a> goggles. Evelyn forces the goggles onto Elastigirl, revealing herself as the mastermind behind the Screenslaver. Evelyn explains that she has hated superheroes since <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Incredibles_characters#List_of_known_superheroes" title="List of The Incredibles characters">Gazerbeam and Fironic</a> failed to rescue her father from being killed by burglars, concluding that superheroes have taken independence from society. She plans to sabotage her brother's summit and cause a catastrophe that will tarnish the reputation of superheroes, ensuring they remain outlawed forever. Using Helen, she lures Bob into a trap, then sends another group of hypnotised superheroes previously invited to the summit to subdue the Parr children. Lucius tries to protect them, but is overwhelmed and placed under Evelyn's control.
</p><p>Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack escape with the help of the Incredibile, a high-tech car once owned by Bob during his time as Mr. Incredible, and reach Winston's ship. On board, the hypnotized Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone recite a vindictive manifesto on air to paint superheroes as a threat. They subdue the ship crew, aim the ship at Municiberg, and destroy the controls. The Incredible children reach them, upon which Jack-Jack removes Elastigirl's goggles, and she frees Mr. Incredible and Frozone. The Parrs and Lucius release the other mind-controlled superheroes by destroying their goggles, then work together to prevent the ship from crashing into the city by turning the rudders to the side. Evelyn attempts to escape in a jet, but is apprehended by Elastigirl and arrested. Due to their actions, superheroes around the world regain legal status.
</p><p>Later, Tony, after getting reconnected to Violet, accompanies her to a movie with the family. When the Parrs spot a high-speed pursuit between <a href="/wiki/Police" title="Police">police</a> and gunmen, Violet leaves Tony at the theater, and the Incredibles give chase in a red Incredibile.

During the getaway, Dom goes rogue, forcing Hobbs off the road and stealing the device for Cipher. Hobbs is arrested and locked up in the same high-security prison he helped imprison Deckard Shaw in.

Deckard reveals that Cipher had hired his brother Owen Shaw to steal the Nightshade device and Mose Jakande to steal God's Eye, Ramsey's software program. The team tracks Dom and Cipher to their very location just as the latter two attack the base and steal God's Eye. When Dom questions Cipher's motives, she reveals that she has been holding hostage Dom's ex-lover and DSS agent Elena Neves—as well as their son, of whose existence Dom was previously unaware. Elena tells Dom that she wanted him to decide the child's first name, having already given him the middle name Marcos.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, Cipher sends Dom to retrieve a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_football" title="Nuclear football">nuclear football</a> held by the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)" title="Ministry of Defence (Russia)">Russian Minister of Defence</a>. Prior to the theft, Dom briefly evades Cipher—with the help of Raldo—and persuades Deckard and Owen's mother, Magdalene Shaw, to help him. Cipher hacks into the electronics systems of a large number of cars, causing them to drive automatically and taking out the convoy so that Dom can take the football. The team intercepts Dom, but Dom escapes, shooting and apparently killing Deckard in the process. Letty catches up to Dom, but is ambushed and nearly killed by Cipher's enforcer, Connor Rhodes, before Dom rescues her. In retaliation, Cipher has Rhodes execute Elena in front of Dom.
</p><p>Dom infiltrates a base in Russia to use the EMP device to disable their security and then to disable a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_submarine" title="Nuclear submarine">nuclear submarine</a>, enabling Cipher to hijack it and attempt to use its arsenal to trigger a nuclear war. They are once again intercepted by the team, who attempt to shut down the sub, and then drive out toward the gates that would prevent the sub from leaving into open waters. Meanwhile, Deckard, whose death was apparently faked, teams up with Owen, and at Magdalene's behest, infiltrates Cipher's plane to rescue Dom's son. Once Deckard reports that the child is safe, Dom turns on Cipher and kills Rhodes, avenging Elena's death, before rejoining his team. Outraged, Cipher fires an <a href="/wiki/Infrared_homing" title="Infrared homing">infrared homing</a> missile at Dom, but he breaks away from his team and maneuvers around it, causing the missile to hit the submarine instead. The team quickly forms a vehicular blockade around Dom, shielding him from the ensuing explosion. Deckard reaches the front of the plane and confronts Cipher, who jumps from the plane with a parachute.
</p><p>Mr. Nobody and his protégé visit Dom and his team in New York City to report that Cipher is still at large in <a href="/wiki/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a>. Hobbs is offered his DSS job back, but he declines in order to spend more time with his daughter. Deckard delivers Dom his son, putting his differences aside with Dom and Hobbs. Dom names his son Brian, after his friend and brother-in-law <a href="/wiki/Brian_O%27Conner" title="Brian O'Conner">Brian O'Conner</a>, and they celebrate.

</p><p>A string of bombings claimed by a terrorist known as the <a href="/wiki/Mandarin_(comics)" title="Mandarin (comics)">Mandarin</a> has left intelligence agencies bewildered by a lack of forensic evidence. Stark's security chief <a href="/wiki/Happy_Hogan_(comics)" title="Happy Hogan (comics)">Happy Hogan</a> is badly injured in one such attack, prompting Stark to brazenly issue a televised threat to the Mandarin. The Mandarin sends gunship helicopters to destroy Stark's home. Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives the attack with Potts. Stark escapes in an experimental new Iron Man suit, which his <a href="/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> <a href="/wiki/Edwin_Jarvis" title="Edwin Jarvis">J.A.R.V.I.S.</a> pilots to rural Tennessee, following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's new armor is not fully functional, and lacks sufficient power to return to California, leaving the world to believe him dead.
</p><p>Teaming with Harley, a 10-year-old boy, Stark investigates the remains of a local explosion bearing the hallmarks of a Mandarin attack. He discovers the "bombings" were triggered by soldiers subjected to Extremis whose bodies explosively rejected the treatment. These explosions were falsely attributed to a terrorist plot in order to cover up Extremis's flaws. Stark witnesses Extremis firsthand when Mandarin agents <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ellen_Brandt" title="Ellen Brandt">Brandt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Coldblood" title="Coldblood">Savin</a> attack him. Meanwhile, Killian resurfaces and kidnaps Potts and Hansen.

</p><p>With Harley's help, Stark traces the Mandarin to <a href="/wiki/Miami" title="Miami">Miami</a> and infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. Inside he discovers the Mandarin is actually an English actor named <a href="/wiki/Trevor_Slattery" title="Trevor Slattery">Trevor Slattery</a>, who is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image. Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin behind Slattery's cover. After capturing Stark, Killian reveals that he has subjected Potts to Extremis in the hope that Stark will help fix Extremis's flaws while trying to save her. Killian kills Hansen when she tries to stop him.
</p><p>Stark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard <a href="/wiki/Air_Force_One" title="Air Force One">Air Force One</a>, using the Iron Patriot armor. Stark saves some surviving passengers and crew but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. They trace Killian to an impounded damaged oil tanker where Killian intends to kill Ellis on live television. The Vice President will become a puppet leader, following Killian's orders in exchange for Extremis to cure his young daughter's disability. On the platform, Stark works to save Potts, as Rhodes goes after the President. Stark summons his remaining Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Rhodes secures the President and takes him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived the Extremis procedure; before he can save her, a rig collapses around them and she falls to her apparent death. Stark confronts Killian and traps him in an Iron Man suit that he self-destructs, but fails to kill him. Potts, whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive her fall, intervenes and kills Killian.
</p><p>Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy each Iron Man suit as a sign of his devotion to Potts, while the Vice President and Slattery are arrested. With Stark's help, Potts' Extremis effects are stabilized, and Stark promises to scale back his life as Iron Man, undergoing surgery to remove the shrapnel near his heart and throwing his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea. He muses that, even without the technology, he will always be Iron Man.

He tramples through London, rescuing his friends and battling Scarlet just as the other Minions turn up in London. Scarlet tries to eradicate them, but Kevin swallows a massive missile she fires at them. Scarlet and Herb attempt to escape with her rocket-dress, but Kevin holds onto it. The missile detonates, causing it to explode. The other Minions stare at the explosion in sadness but Kevin turns out to have survived and shrunk back to his normal size.

They locate two surviving cosmonauts, who reveal satellite photos of hundreds of Pillars being stockpiled on the Moon. Sam realizes that the Decepticons raided the "Ark" long before the Apollo 11 mission to the moon and intentionally left Sentinel and the five Pillars for the Autobots to find, as Sentinel is the key to activating the Pillars and the Decepticons lacked the means to revive him. The Autobots fight off three pursuing Decepticons: the Dreads, and rush to return Sentinel to their base for protection, but Sentinel betrays them and murders the Autobot <a href="/wiki/Ironhide" title="Ironhide">Ironhide</a>, revealing he had made a deal with Megatron to ensure Cybertron's survival.

The Autobots are exiled from Earth at the demand of the Decepticons to avoid war, but as their ship leaves Earth it is destroyed by <a href="/wiki/Starscream" title="Starscream">Starscream</a>, seemingly killing the Autobots. The Decepticons, led by Megatron and Sentinel, invade <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> as their agents place Pillars around the world.

Sentinel severs Optimus's right arm and is about to execute him until Megatron, having listened to Carly, intervenes, incapacitating Sentinel. Megatron slyly proposes a truce, having the desire to become the one in charge again, but Optimus instead attacks Megatron, decapitating and killing him. Sentinel pleads for his life, but Optimus executes him too for his betrayal.

</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, Bond follows Patrice into a skyscraper but is unable to prevent him from killing a target. The two fight, but Patrice falls to his death before Bond can learn his employer's identity. Bond finds a <a href="/wiki/Casino_token" title="Casino token">casino token</a> that Patrice intended to cash in for the assassination, which leads him to a casino in <a href="/wiki/Macau" title="Macau">Macau</a>.

</p><p>At MI6's new underground headquarters, Q attempts to decrypt Silva's laptop, but inadvertently gives it access to the MI6 servers, which allows Silva to escape.

</p><p>Sixty-five million years ago, an alien race known as the “Creators” used devices called Seeds to terraform Planet Earth, covering it with an alloy called Transformium. In the present day, <a href="/wiki/Geologist" title="Geologist">geologist</a> Darcy Tyril excavates the Transformium for K.S.I. Industries, which uses it to build man-made Transformer drones.
</p><p>Five years after <a href="/wiki/Transformers:_Dark_of_the_Moon" title="Transformers: Dark of the Moon">the Battle of Chicago</a>, humans have begun to view the Transformers as a threat, leading the U.S. government to terminate all human-Autobot joint programs. Although the public believes the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Autobots" title="Autobots">Autobots</a> have been granted sanctuary, they are being hunted by a rogue <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CIA" title="CIA">CIA</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Black_ops" title="Black ops">black ops</a> division known as Cemetery Wind, led by opportunistic government official Harold Attinger, who believes all Transformers should be exterminated regardless of their faction. They are aided by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lockdown_(Transformers)" title="Lockdown (Transformers)">Lockdown</a>, a Cybertronian <a href="/wiki/Bounty_hunter" title="Bounty hunter">bounty hunter</a> working for the Creators, promising to give Attinger a Seed if his division manages to capture <a href="/wiki/Optimus_Prime" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a>. Cemetery Wind locates <a href="/wiki/Ratchet_(Transformers)" title="Ratchet (Transformers)">Ratchet</a> in <a href="/wiki/Mexico_City" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a> and Lockdown kills him when he refuses to give up the whereabouts of Optimus Prime.
</p><p>Optimus, damaged in Mexico City and disguised as a rundown semi-truck, is discovered in an abandoned theater by Cade Yeager, a financially struggling Texan inventor, and brings him back to his farm. While his teenage daughter Tessa and business partner Lucas Flannery encourage him to turn Optimus over to the authorities after realizing what he really is, Cade instead fixes Optimus, hoping to understand his technology and unexpectedly revives him. Still skeptical of Optimus, Lucas calls Cemetery Wind, who attacks and destroys the farm, but Optimus and Tessa's boyfriend, Irish <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rally_car" title="Rally car">rally car</a> driver Shane Dyson, come to the family's aid. While on the run from Cemetery Wind and Lockdown, Lucas is killed by one of Lockdown's grenades. Escaping into the desert, they take refuge in an abandoned gas station. Later, Optimus scans a passing truck and turns into a Western Star 5700 Phantom Custom truck with the original red and blue paint with flames, and summons the surviving Autobots – <a href="/wiki/Bumblebee_(Transformers)" title="Bumblebee (Transformers)">Bumblebee</a>, who has assumed an alternate form, <a href="/wiki/Hound_(Transformers)" title="Hound (Transformers)">Hound</a>, <a href="/wiki/Drift_(Transformers)" title="Drift (Transformers)">Drift</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crosshairs_(Transformers)" title="Crosshairs (Transformers)">Crosshairs</a> – who have come to distrust humans due to Cemetery Wind constantly hunting them down. Using a CIA drone which he stole during the home invasion, Cade discovers K.S.I.'s involvement in the attacks on the Autobots. Optimus vows to personally kill Attinger for his actions against his brethren.
</p><p>Infiltrating K.S.I.'s headquarters in <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, Cade discovers the remains of Autobots and Decepticons are being melted down to make the drones. Joshua Joyce, the ambitious company CEO, is in league with Attinger to revolutionize global defenses and improve human society using the Seed. He has captured Brains and used him and data from <a href="/wiki/Megatron" title="Megatron">Megatron</a>'s head to create the drones and prototype Transformer soldiers <a href="/wiki/Galvatron" title="Galvatron">Galvatron</a> and Stinger. In a fit of rage, the Autobots storm the building, during which Bumblebee regains his original form by scanning a passing car, where they rescue Brains and destroy the laboratory, but they soon leave after Joshua announces that they are no longer needed. Attinger forces Joshua to deploy Galvatron and Stinger to attack the Autobots. During the battle, Galvatron's behavior becomes slightly erratic when it starts destroying vehicles, and when it fights Optimus it speaks to him. Lockdown then arrives and abducts Optimus while Galvatron and Stinger retreat; Tessa is inadvertently captured alongside Optimus in the midst of the chaos, leaving Cade and Shane devastated.
</p><p>While Lockdown's large prison spacecraft hovers over Chicago to hand over the Seed, Cade, Shane, and the Autobots use the opportunity to sneak on board and rescue Optimus and Tessa, hijacking a smaller ship containing a group of Autobots called the <a href="/wiki/Dinobots" title="Dinobots">Dinobots</a>, just before Lockdown leaves Earth. The Autobots reveal to Cade that "Galvatron" is in fact Megatron, who gave K.S.I. the data to build the Transformer drones so he could transfer his consciousness into the Galvatron drone, after they had unknowingly revived him. What's more, Galvatron is plotting to use the Seed and the K.S.I. drones to conquer the world by detonating the Seed in <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, as K.S.I. has brought it there to use it in the remote Mongolian desert to create vast amounts of usable Transformium. Cade informs Joshua of Megatron's presence, causing him to have a change of heart and agreeing to hand over the Seed with help from Darcy and his Chinese business associate Su Yueming. Meanwhile, Lockdown discovers Optimus' escape with the Dinobots, and returns to Earth to retrieve them. Optimus decides for the Autobots to no longer help the humans because of how they revived Megatron, but Cade explains to Optimus why he shouldn't lose faith in them. At the K.S.I. facility, during a disagreement between Joshua and Attinger over the Seed, Galvatron reactivates himself and promptly takes control of the K.S.I. drones, and a battle follows in Hong Kong's streets between Cade's group, the Autobots, Cemetery Wind, Galvatron, and his drones. During the fight, Optimus gains the alliance of the Dinobots, who become essential to the Autobots' victory while Bumblebee kills Stinger.
</p><p>Lockdown returns to capture Optimus and the Dinobots, using a large <a href="/wiki/Magnet" title="Magnet">magnet</a> in his ship that picks up and drops metal objects, causing destruction to the city. After disabling the magnet, Optimus fights Lockdown at an abandoned factory. In the ensuing duel, Optimus kills Attinger (who still angrily deems all Cybertronians aside from Lockdown as a threat) to save Cade, and avenging the deaths of his fellow Autobots, but this allows Lockdown to pin Optimus down by impaling his chest with his own sword. Cade, Bumblebee, Tessa, and Shane fight Lockdown, with Cade ending up fighting him one-on-one while Tessa and Shane use a tow truck to free Optimus, who kills Lockdown by cutting him in half before using one of his grenades to finish off the remaining drones. Galvatron retreats, vowing to return.
</p><p>As Lockdown's ship leaves Earth, Optimus tells the Autobots to protect the Yeagers (with Joshua offering to help the Yeagers build a new home) and lets the Dinobots go, before flying away into space with the Seed to hide it away, sending a message to the Creators that <a href="/wiki/Transformers:_The_Last_Knight" title="Transformers: The Last Knight">he is coming for them</a>.

Wayne's butler, <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred Pennyworth</a>, reveals that Rachel Dawes had intended to marry Dent before she died, and resigns in an attempt to save Bruce from death at the hands of Bane. Wayne finds comfort in new Wayne Enterprises CEO Miranda Tate.

Bane reveals that he intends to fulfill <a href="/wiki/Ra%27s_al_Ghul" title="Ra's al Ghul">Ra's al Ghul's</a> mission to destroy Gotham, and then steals Batman's technology from Wayne Enterprises. Bane fights Batman and cripples him, before taking him abroad to an underground prison. There, the inmates tell Wayne the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, who was born and raised in the prison before finally escaping — the only prisoner to have done so.
</p><p>Bane lures Gotham's police into the underground sewer network and uses explosives to trap them, and destroy the bridges surrounding the city. He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia and forces a nuclear physicist to convert the reactor core into a decaying <a href="/wiki/Neutron_bomb" title="Neutron bomb">neutron bomb</a> before killing him as well. Bane reads Gordon's speech to the public, and releases the prisoners of <a href="/wiki/Blackgate_Penitentiary" title="Blackgate Penitentiary">Blackgate Penitentiary</a>, initiating chaos while holding the city hostage and isolated with the bomb.
</p><p>Months later, a recovered Wayne escapes from the prison and returns to Gotham.

She activates the bomb's detonator, but Gordon blocks her signal. Talia leaves to find the bomb while Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Kyle arrives and kills Bane. Batman and Kyle pursue Talia, hoping to bring the bomb back to the reactor chamber where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she remotely floods and destroys the reactor chamber before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman uses the <a href="/wiki/Batplane" title="Batplane">Batplane</a> to haul the bomb far over the bay, where it safely explodes.

As the toys try to leave, Lotso's henchmen retreat and Lotso drags Woody into the dumpster as the truck collects the trash. The rest of the toys fall into the truck while trying to rescue him, except Barbie, Ken and Big Baby. A falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and personality. The truck brings the toys to a landfill, where the Aliens are swept away by spotting an industrial claw and the other toys are deposited on a conveyor belt that leads to an <a href="/wiki/Incineration" title="Incineration">incinerator</a>. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate and prepare to die, but are rescued by the Aliens operating the claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who ties him to his truck's radiator <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grille_(motor_vehicle)" title="Grille (motor vehicle)">grille</a> and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.
</p><p>Woody leaves a note for Andy, who, thinking the note is from his mother, donates the toys to Bonnie. To Andy's surprise, Woody is at the bottom of the donation box and Bonnie recognizes him. Though hesitant at first, Andy passes Woody on to Bonnie, and they play together before he leaves. Woody and the other toys witness Andy's departure as they begin their new lives with Bonnie.
</p><p>In the credits scene, Barbie, Ken, and Big Baby have made vast improvements to Sunnyside and maintain contact with the other toys through letters. After parachuting in, the army men are welcomed to Sunnyside.
</p><p>The wedding of <a href="/wiki/Will_Turner" title="Will Turner">Will Turner</a> and <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Swann" title="Elizabeth Swann">Elizabeth Swann</a> is halted when Lord <a href="/wiki/Cutler_Beckett" title="Cutler Beckett">Cutler Beckett</a>, chairman of the <a href="/wiki/East_India_Company" title="East India Company">East India Trading Company</a>, arrives with <a href="/wiki/Arrest_warrant" title="Arrest warrant">arrest warrants</a> for them, and also for Commodore <a href="/wiki/James_Norrington" title="James Norrington">James Norrington</a>, who allowed Captain <a href="/wiki/Jack_Sparrow" title="Jack Sparrow">Jack Sparrow</a> to escape. Norrington has resigned and disappeared after losing the Navy's <a href="/wiki/Flagship" title="Flagship">flagship</a>, HMS <i>Dauntless</i>, in a hurricane while pursuing Jack. Meanwhile, Jack is visited by Will's father, <a href="/wiki/Bootstrap_Bill_Turner" title="Bootstrap Bill Turner">Bootstrap Bill Turner</a>, aboard the <i><a href="/wiki/Black_Pearl" title="Black Pearl">Black Pearl</a></i>. Bootstrap is now a crewman on the <i><a href="/wiki/Flying_Dutchman_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" title="Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)">Flying Dutchman</a></i>, captained by <a href="/wiki/Davy_Jones_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" title="Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)">Davy Jones</a>.

Beckett, meanwhile, promises to free Elizabeth if Will brings him Jack's magic compass which points to whatever the holder wants most.
</p><p>Will finds Jack and the crew on an island and frees them from <a href="/wiki/Cannibalism" title="Cannibalism">cannibals</a>. Shortly after, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_characters#Governor_Swann" title="List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters">Governor Swann</a> frees Elizabeth from jail, but he is then captured. Elizabeth bargains with Beckett to find the compass. Disguised as a cabin boy aboard a Scottish merchant vessel, she makes her way to Tortuga where she later finds Jack and also a drunken Norrington. After escaping the cannibals, Jack and the crew visit <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/voodoo" title="wikt:voodoo">voodoo</a> priestess <a href="/wiki/Tia_Dalma" title="Tia Dalma">Tia Dalma</a>, who reveals Jones' weakness is his heart, which is locked within the Dead Man's Chest. Jack must find it and the key that opens it. Locating the <i>Dutchman</i>, Will makes a deal with Jack to find the key to the chest in return for Jack's compass. Jack tricks Will, who is <a href="/wiki/Shanghaiing" title="Shanghaiing">shanghaied</a> into service aboard the <i>Dutchman</i>. Jones agrees to release Jack from their bargain in exchange for one hundred souls. Will meets his father aboard the <i>Dutchman</i> and learns that Jones possesses the key to the chest. They play a game of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Liar%27s_Dice" title="Liar's Dice">Liar's Dice</a> against Jones to try and win the key, but they lose. Despite this, Will escapes with the key and is taken aboard the same ship Elizabeth was on. Jones sends the Kraken after him, sinking the ship, but Will escapes.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/List_of_locations_in_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean#Tortuga" title="List of locations in Pirates of the Caribbean">Tortuga</a>, Jack hires a new crew, including Elizabeth and Norrington. With Elizabeth's use of Jack's compass, they are able to locate the chest. All parties arrive on <a href="/wiki/List_of_locations_in_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean#Isla_Cruces" title="List of locations in Pirates of the Caribbean">Isla Cruces</a>, where the chest is buried, but a three-way sword fight breaks out between Jack, Will, and Norrington, who all want the heart for their respective goals: Jack wants to call off the Kraken; Will wants to rescue his father; and Norrington wants to regain his life as a Navy officer. In the chaos, Norrington secretly steals the heart and runs off, pretending to lure away the <i>Dutchman</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s crew. Jones attacks the <i>Pearl</i> with the Kraken, which kills most of the crew and destroys all but one of the <i>Pearl</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s lifeboats, but Jack, who briefly flees the battle, returns and wounds the Kraken with a net full of gunpowder and rum.
</p><p>Jack orders the survivors to abandon ship, but Elizabeth, realizing the Kraken only wants Jack, tricks him and chains him to the mast so that the crew can escape. The Kraken drags Jack and the <i>Pearl</i> to Davy Jones' Locker. Jones opens the chest to discover his heart is gone. In Port Royal, Norrington gives Beckett the heart and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Letters_of_Marque" title="Letters of Marque">Letters of Marque</a> meant for Jack, allowing him back into the navy as well as allowing Beckett to gain control of Davy Jones and the seas. The <i>Pearl</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s crew take shelter with Tia Dalma, where they all agree to rescue Jack.

</p><p>In a <a href="/wiki/Post-credits_scene" title="Post-credits scene">post-credits scene</a>, the cannibalistic tribe now worships the prison dog in replacement of Jack.
</p><p>Research scientist Galen Erso and his family are in hiding on the planet Lah'mu when <a href="/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(Star_Wars)" title="Galactic Empire (Star Wars)">Imperial</a> weapons developer <a href="/wiki/Orson_Krennic" title="Orson Krennic">Orson Krennic</a> arrives to press him into completing the <a href="/wiki/Death_Star" title="Death Star">Death Star</a>, a moon-sized <a href="/wiki/Space_station" title="Space station">space station</a> with a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Superweapon" title="Superweapon">superweapon</a> capable of destroying entire planets.

</p><p>Fifteen years later, cargo pilot <a href="/wiki/Bodhi_Rook" title="Bodhi Rook">Bodhi Rook</a> defects from the Empire, taking a holographic message recorded by Galen to Gerrera on the desert moon of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jedha" title="Jedha">Jedha</a>. After learning about the Death Star from an agent at the Ring of Kafrene trading outpost, <a href="/wiki/Rebel_Alliance" title="Rebel Alliance">Rebel Alliance</a> intelligence officer <a href="/wiki/Cassian_Andor" title="Cassian Andor">Cassian Andor</a> frees Jyn from an Imperial transport at Wobani before bringing her to the Rebel leader <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mon_Mothma" title="Mon Mothma">Mon Mothma</a>, who convinces her to find and rescue Galen so the Alliance can learn more about the Death Star. Cassian is covertly ordered to kill Galen rather than extract him.
</p><p>Jyn, Cassian, and reprogrammed Imperial <a href="/wiki/Droid_(Star_Wars)" title="Droid (Star Wars)">droid</a> <a href="/wiki/K-2SO" title="K-2SO">K-2SO</a> travel to the moon of Jedha, where the Empire is removing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kyber_crystal" title="Kyber crystal">kyber crystals</a> from the holy city to power the Death Star. However, Gerrera and his partisans engage in a guerrilla battle against one convoy transporting kyber crystals, and then steal the load as Imperial reinforcements arrive. With the aid of blind spiritual warrior <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chirrut_%C3%8Emwe" title="Chirrut Îmwe">Chirrut Îmwe</a> and his mercenary friend <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Baze_Malbus" title="Baze Malbus">Baze Malbus</a>, Jyn makes contact with Gerrera, who has been holding Rook captive. Gerrera shows her the message, in which Galen reveals he has secretly built a vulnerability into the Death Star and directs them to retrieve the schematics from an Imperial data bank on the planet <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scarif" title="Scarif">Scarif</a>.
</p><p>On the Death Star, which has entered orbit above the moon of Jedha, Krennic orders a low-powered test shot which destroys Jedha's capital. Jyn and her group take Rook and flee the moon, but Gerrera remains to die with the city.  <a href="/wiki/Grand_Moff_Tarkin" title="Grand Moff Tarkin">Grand Moff Willhuff Tarkin</a> congratulates Krennic before using Rook's defection and security leak as a pretext to take control of the project. Rook leads the group to Galen's Imperial research facility on the storm-covered planet <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eadu" title="Eadu">Eadu</a>, where Cassian chooses not to kill Galen. Jyn makes her presence known moments before Rebel bombers attack the facility. Galen is fatally wounded and dies in his daughter's arms, before she escapes with her group on board a stolen Imperial cargo shuttle. Following the attack, Krennic is summoned by <a href="/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a> to his palace at Mustafar to answer for the attack on Eadu. Krennic seeks his support for an audience with <a href="/wiki/Palpatine" title="Palpatine">the Emperor</a>, but Vader instead orders him to ensure no further breaches occur.
</p><p>Jyn proposes a plan to steal the Death Star schematics using the Rebel fleet, but fails to gain the Alliance Council's approval; many members do not believe the Death Star exists, and those who do feel that victory over the Empire has become impossible. Frustrated at their inaction, Jyn's group leads a small squad of volunteers to raid the data bank themselves. Arriving at Scarif on the stolen Imperial shuttle, which Rook dubs "Rogue One", a disguised Jyn and Cassian enter the base with <span class="nowrap">K-2SO</span> while the other rebels attack the resident <a href="/wiki/Stormtrooper_(Star_Wars)" title="Stormtrooper (Star Wars)">Imperial garrison</a> as a diversion. The Rebel fleet learns of the raid from intercepted Imperial communications and deploy in support. K-2SO sacrifices himself so Jyn and Cassian can retrieve the data. Îmwe is killed after activating the master switch to allow communication with the Rebel fleet, and Malbus dies in battle shortly afterwards. During the battle, Rook is killed by a thermal detonator explosion after informing the Rebel fleet that they must breach the shield surrounding the planet to allow the transmission of the schematics. Jyn and Cassian obtain the schematics, but they are ambushed by Krennic, who is eventually shot and wounded by Cassian. Jyn transmits the schematics to the Rebel command ship. The Death Star enters orbit above Scarif, where Tarkin uses another low-power shot to destroy the compromised base, killing Krennic, Cassian, Jyn, and anyone still alive on the surface.
</p><p>The Rebel fleet prepares to jump to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hyperspace_(science_fiction)" title="Hyperspace (science fiction)">hyperspace</a>, but many of its ships are intercepted by Vader's flagship. Vader boards the Rebel command ship and attempts to regain the schematics, but a small starship, the <i><a href="/wiki/Tantive_IV" title="Tantive IV">Tantive IV</a></i>, escapes with them.

</p><p>Jack refuses the offer and escapes. He meets up with his father, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Captain_Teague" title="Captain Teague">Captain Teague</a>, who warns Jack about the Fountain's rituals. Jack learns someone is impersonating him to recruit a crew to find the Fountain. The impostor is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Angelica_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" title="Angelica (Pirates of the Caribbean)">Angelica</a>, Jack's former lover, and the daughter of the ruthless pirate <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Blackbeard_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" title="Blackbeard (Pirates of the Caribbean)">Blackbeard</a>, who practices <a href="/wiki/Haitian_Vodou" title="Haitian Vodou">voodoo</a> magic and wields the mythical "Sword of <a href="/wiki/Triton_(mythology)" title="Triton (mythology)">Triton</a>" that controls his ship, the <i><a href="/wiki/Queen_Anne%27s_Revenge" title="Queen Anne's Revenge">Queen Anne's Revenge</a></i>. While Jack is <a href="/wiki/Shanghaiing" title="Shanghaiing">shanghaied</a> aboard Blackbeard's ship, Gibbs escapes execution by memorizing and destroying Jack's map showing the Fountain's location, forcing Barbossa to take him along.
</p><p>Meanwhile, after a failed <a href="/wiki/Mutiny" title="Mutiny">mutiny</a> aboard the <i>Queen Anne's Revenge</i>, Jack is forced to guide the crew to the Fountain. Blackbeard seeks the Fountain's power to circumvent his predestined fatal encounter with a "one-legged man", who happened to be Barbossa. Jack must find two silver chalices aboard <a href="/wiki/Juan_Ponce_de_Le%C3%B3n" title="Juan Ponce de León">Juan Ponce de León</a>'s missing <a href="/wiki/Flagship" title="Flagship">flagship</a>, the <i>Santiago</i>. The Fountain's water must simultaneously be drunk by two people from the chalices. Drinking from one chalice containing a <a href="/wiki/Mermaid" title="Mermaid">mermaid</a>'s tear will extend life; the second person dies, their remaining years of life transferred to the other drinker. Jack also discovers that the <i>Black Pearl</i> was captured and shrunk before being added to Blackbeard's collection of other shrunken <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ship_in_a_bottle" title="Ship in a bottle">ships in bottles</a>.
</p><p>The <i>Queen Anne's Revenge</i> heads for Whitecap Bay to find and harvest mermaid tears. After managing to lure in a mermaid named Tamara, she summons other mermaids to attack the crew before Jack causes an explosion that scares them away. A mermaid named Syrena is caught, but Philip Swift, a captive missionary, falls in love with her. Reaching Ponce de León's ship on an uncharted island, Angelica and Blackbeard coerce Jack into retrieving both chalices. Jack locates the grounded, decaying vessel, only to find Barbossa there. Both guess that the Spanish have taken the chalices, after they are nowhere to be found on the vessel.
</p><p>Jack and Barbossa team up to sneak into the Spanish camp and steal the chalices. Barbossa reveals he only wants revenge against Blackbeard for attacking the <i>Black Pearl</i>, and his leg being amputated. Jack and Barbossa escape with the chalices. Meanwhile, Syrena, reciprocating Philip's love, is tricked into shedding a tear. Blackbeard collects it, leaving her to die of dehydration while Philip is forced to go with them. Jack returns with the chalices and bargains with Blackbeard for Angelica's safety, Jack's confiscated magical compass (which they took from him before sending him to get the chalices), and Gibbs' release. In return, Jack vows to give Blackbeard the chalices and lead him to the Fountain; Blackbeard agrees, and Gibbs is set free with the compass.
</p><p>At the Fountain, Blackbeard's crew is confronted by Barbossa and his men and they battle while Barbossa and Blackbeard fight. The Spanish suddenly arrive, intending to destroy the Fountain, believing its power an abomination against God. They crush the chalices and throw them in the swamp. When Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with a poisoned sword, Angelica pulls it out but is cut and poisoned. Jack notices Angelica is poisoned and begins frantically searching the swamp for the chalices. Barbossa obtains Blackbeard's magic sword and gains control of the <i>Queen Anne's Revenge</i> and her crew. Despite resistance from Blackbeard's crew, the Spanish successfully pull down a pillar, crushing the Fountain of Youth. The Spanish army leaves once the fountain is in ruins. Philip is mortally wounded, but he returns to free Syrena. She helps Jack retrieve the missing chalices and gives them to him, telling him not to waste her tear. Syrena goes back to the dying Philip. She says she can save him if he asks her to. When he asks for her forgiveness, she kisses him and takes him underwater.
</p><p>With Blackbeard and Angelica both nearing death, Jack retrieves the last remaining drops of water from the destroyed fountain and puts the tear in one of them. Knowing that one of them must be sacrificed, he wants Angelica to drink from the chalice containing the tear. Instead, Blackbeard drinks it, asking his daughter to save him. Angelica agrees and drinks from the second chalice. Jack is upset to lose Angelica, but reveals that he made a mistake about which chalice contained the tear. Neither of the two are happy, and they both believe Jack deliberately tricked them. Angelica's wounds are healed as the Fountain fatally consumes Blackbeard's body, killing him.
</p><p>Eventually, Jack and Angelica admit their love for each other, yet he distrusts her intentions (aware that she may try to avenge her father) and strands her on a <a href="/wiki/Cay" title="Cay">cay</a>. Now wielding Blackbeard's magical sword, Barbossa captains the <i>Queen Anne's Revenge</i> and returns to piracy. Jack finds Gibbs, who had used the compass to locate the <i>Revenge</i>. He reclaims the shrunken <i>Black Pearl</i> and the other conquered ships in bottles, carrying them in a <a href="/wiki/Gunny_sack" title="Gunny sack">gunny sack</a>. The two leave, <a href="/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_Dead_Men_Tell_No_Tales" title="Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales">hoping to revert the <i>Black Pearl</i> to its original size and continue living the pirates' life</a>.

</p><p>Former villain Gru is now an agent for the Anti-Villain League (AVL). He and his partner/new wife Lucy are sent to foil the plans of Balthazar Bratt, a former <a href="/wiki/Child_actor" title="Child actor">child actor</a> from the 1980s who has turned evil. Gru manages to stop Bratt from stealing the Dumont Diamond, a giant pink diamond, but is unable to capture him. As a result of constantly failing to capture Bratt, Gru and Lucy are <a href="/wiki/Termination_of_employment" title="Termination of employment">fired</a> from the AVL by its unreasonable new director Valerie Da Vinci, following the retirement of the AVL's former director, Silas Ramsbottom.
</p><p>When Gru and Lucy return home, Gru and Lucy reluctantly tell their kids, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, of their dismissal, but assure them they will find new jobs. Most of Gru's <a href="/wiki/Minions_(Despicable_Me)" title="Minions (Despicable Me)">Minions</a> leave Gru when he refuses to return to villainy despite losing his job, with Kevin, Stuart, and Bob staying due to not knowing. Meanwhile, Lucy struggles to adapt to her new role as the children's new mom. The next morning, when a butler named Fritz arrives at the Gru house, Gru discovers that he has a twin brother named Dru, who lives in a distant country named Freedonia, who longs to meet him. Shocked to learn he has a twin, Gru confronts his mother, who reveals that when she and her husband <a href="/wiki/Divorce" title="Divorce">divorced</a>, they agreed to keep one child each. The family decides to travel to meet Dru, and they are surprised at his immense wealth, the size of the mansion, which Fritz attributes to their pig farm business. Meanwhile, the Minions are arrested for trespassing at a talent show set. Bratt manages to steal the diamond again, intending to use it to power a giant robot and destroy Hollywood as revenge for the cancellation of his show.
</p><p>Dru reveals to Gru that their recently deceased father was a legendary supervillain, whose villainous activities are the real source of the family's wealth. As Dru was dismissed by their father as a disgrace, he asks his brother to teach him how to be a villain. When Gru refuses to revert to his old ways, Dru takes him on a joyride around Freedonia in their father's technologically advanced car and the siblings bond. Meanwhile, Lucy tries to balance her new tasks as a mom, which she exhibits after turning away a young boy named Niko who had fallen for Margo in the midst of a traditional cheese festival, while Edith and Agnes stumble into a local tavern and learn from the bartender about a mythical <a href="/wiki/Unicorn" title="Unicorn">unicorn</a> which lurks in a nearby forest. Gru tries to convince Agnes that unicorns are imaginary, but decides against it to avoid hurting her feelings. The next day, Agnes and Edith set out into the woods to track the mythical 'unicorn', only to find a one-horned <a href="/wiki/Goat" title="Goat">goat</a> whom Agnes adopts and dubs "Lucky". Meanwhile, the Minions' longing for Gru motivates them to escape from prison and return to their former master.
</p><p>Dru convinces Gru to steal the diamond, with Gru secretly intending to bring it to the AVL, which he hopes will convince Da Vinci to rehire him and Lucy. Despite several setbacks, they manage to retrieve the diamond and are rescued by Lucy after narrowly escaping. After finding out Gru's true motives, Dru confronts his brother about his lie. In return, Gru insults him and decides to leave Freedonia, ending their relationship. Bratt, disguised as Lucy, kidnaps the children, and once again acquires the diamond. Gru and Dru resolve their differences and pursue him after finding the real Lucy.
</p><p>With his robot powered by the diamond, Bratt terrorizes Hollywood, intending to send it into space with the use of superpowered gum. Lucy saves the children while Gru and Dru weaken Bratt's robot with the weapons of their father's car. Gru is knocked unconscious when the car is destroyed, and Dru manages to destroy the robot's core from the inside when Bratt threatens to kill Gru. When Gru recovers, he battles Bratt in a dance fight, using it as a distraction to grab his weaponized <a href="/wiki/Keytar" title="Keytar">keytar</a>, and defeats him. Having rendezvoused with Gru, the Minions manage to destroy the gum already covering the city, and Gru and Dru reunite.
</p><p>Soon afterward, Gru and Lucy are reinstated in the AVL and the newly united family celebrate in Gru's home. Lucy is acknowledged by the children as their mother. Lured back to villainy, Dru, along with most of the Minions, steals Gru's airship, with Gru's emblem replaced with a "D" graffiti. Gru and Lucy decide to give them a five-minute head-start before engaging pursuit.
</p><p>Industrialist John Hammond and his <a href="/wiki/Biological_engineering" title="Biological engineering">bioengineering</a> company, InGen, have created a <a href="/wiki/Animal_theme_park" title="Animal theme park">theme park</a> featuring cloned dinosaurs and prehistoric plants, called Jurassic Park, on <a href="/wiki/Isla_Nublar" title="Isla Nublar">Isla Nublar</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rican</a> island. After a dinosaur handler is killed by a <i><a href="/wiki/Velociraptor" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a></i>, the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro, demand that experts visit the park and certify it is safe. To perform the inspection, Gennaro invites <a href="/wiki/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chaos_theory" title="Chaos theory">chaos theorist</a> Ian Malcolm, while Hammond invites <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paleontologist" title="Paleontologist">paleontologist</a> Dr. Alan Grant and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paleobotanist" title="Paleobotanist">paleobotanist</a> Dr. Ellie Sattler. Upon arrival, the group is shocked to see a live <i><a href="/wiki/Brachiosaurus" title="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a></i>, in addition to two more with a herd of <i><a href="/wiki/Parasaurolophus" title="Parasaurolophus">Parasaurolophus</a></i>.
</p><p>At the park's visitor center, the group learns the cloning was accomplished by extracting <a href="/wiki/Ancient_DNA" title="Ancient DNA">dinosaur DNA</a> from <a href="/wiki/Mosquito" title="Mosquito">mosquitoes</a> preserved in <a href="/wiki/Amber" title="Amber">amber</a>. DNA from <a href="/wiki/Frog" title="Frog">frogs</a> was used to fill in gaps in the dinosaurs' <a href="/wiki/Genome" title="Genome">genome</a>. To prevent breeding, all the dinosaurs were made female. Malcolm scoffs at the idea, saying it will inevitably break down. The group witnesses the hatching of a baby <i><a href="/wiki/Velociraptor" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a></i> and visits the raptor enclosure. At lunch, the group debates the <a href="/wiki/Ethics_of_cloning" title="Ethics of cloning">ethics of cloning</a> and the creation of the park. Malcolm gives a harsh warning about the implications of <a href="/wiki/Genetic_engineering" title="Genetic engineering">genetic engineering</a>.
</p><p>The group is joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Tim and Lex, for a tour of the park, while Hammond oversees the tour from the park's control room. The tour does not go as planned. Most of the dinosaurs fail to appear and the group encounters a sick <i><a href="/wiki/Triceratops" title="Triceratops">Triceratops</a></i>. It is cut short as a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" title="Tropical cyclone">tropical storm</a> approaches Isla Nublar. Most park employees leave for the mainland on a boat, while the visitors return to their electric tour vehicles. Sattler stays behind with the park's veterinarian to study the <i>Triceratops</i>.
</p><p>Jurassic Park's lead computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, has been bribed by Dodgson, a man working for Hammond's corporate rival, to steal fertilized dinosaur <a href="/wiki/Embryo" title="Embryo">embryos</a>. Nedry deactivates the park's security system to gain access to the embryo storage room and puts the stolen embryos inside a canister disguised as a shaving cream bottle. The power goes out, stalling the tour vehicles. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated, allowing the <i><a href="/wiki/Tyrannosaurus" title="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></i> to escape and attack the group. Grant and Hammond's grandchildren survive. The <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro. While taking the embryos to the island's dock, Nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes his <a href="/wiki/Jeep_Wrangler" title="Jeep Wrangler">Jeep Wrangler</a>, and is killed by a <i><a href="/wiki/Dilophosaurus" title="Dilophosaurus">Dilophosaurus</a></i>.
</p><p>Sattler helps the park's game warden, Robert Muldoon, search for survivors. They find only Malcolm before the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> returns. Grant, Tim, and Lex take shelter in a treetop. They later discover broken dinosaur egg shells. Grant concludes the dinosaurs have been breeding. This occurred because their frog DNA—<a href="/wiki/African_bullfrog" title="African bullfrog">West African bullfrogs</a> can change their sex in a single-sex environment, allowing the dinosaurs to do so as well, proving Malcolm right.
</p><p>Unable to decipher Nedry's code to reactivate the security system, Hammond and the park's chief engineer Ray Arnold reboot the park's system. The group shuts down the park's grid and retreats to an emergency bunker, while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When Arnold fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head to the shed. They discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining fences and released the <i>Velociraptors</i>.

</p><p>Dory, a <a href="/wiki/Paracanthurus" title="Paracanthurus">regal blue tang</a>, gets separated from her parents as a child. As she grows up, Dory attempts to search for them, but gradually forgets them due to her short-term memory loss. In the flashback of the previous film, <i><a href="/wiki/Finding_Nemo" title="Finding Nemo">Finding Nemo</a></i>, she joins Marlin – a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Clownfish" title="Clownfish">clownfish</a> looking for his missing son Nemo – after accidentally swimming into him.
</p><p>One year later, Dory is living with Marlin and Nemo on their reef. One day, Dory has a <a href="/wiki/Flashback_(psychology)" title="Flashback (psychology)">flashback</a> and remembers that she has parents. She decides to look for them, but her memory problem is an obstacle. She eventually remembers that they lived at the Jewel of <a href="/wiki/Morro_Bay,_California" title="Morro Bay, California">Morro Bay, California</a> across the ocean, thanks to Nemo mentioning its name.
</p><p>Marlin and Nemo accompany Dory. With the help of Crush, their sea turtle friend, they ride the <a href="/wiki/California_Current" title="California Current">California Current</a> to California. Upon arrival, they explore a shipwreck full of spilt cargo, where Dory accidentally awakens a giant, glowing <a href="/wiki/Humboldt_squid" title="Humboldt squid">Humboldt squid</a>, who immediately pursues them and almost devours Nemo. They successfully trap the squid in a large shipping container. Marlin berates Dory for endangering them. Her feelings hurt, Dory travels to the surface to seek help and is captured by staff members from the trio's nearby destination, the Marine Life Institute after getting entangled in <a href="/wiki/Six_pack_rings" title="Six pack rings">six pack rings</a>.
</p><p>Dory is placed in the quarantine section and tagged. There she meets a grouchy, but well-meaning <a href="/wiki/Octopus" title="Octopus">octopus</a> named Hank (who is now a "septopus", due to apparently having had one of his eight tentacles ripped off by a child.) Dory's tag shows that she will be sent to an aquarium in <a href="/wiki/Cleveland" title="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>. Due to a traumatic ocean life, Hank wants to live in the aquarium instead of being released back into the ocean, so he agrees to help Dory find her parents in exchange for her tag. In one exhibit, Dory encounters her childhood friend Destiny, a nearsighted <a href="/wiki/Whale_shark" title="Whale shark">whale shark</a>, who used to communicate with Dory through pipes, and Bailey, a <a href="/wiki/Beluga_whale" title="Beluga whale">beluga whale</a>, who mistakenly believes he has lost his ability to <a href="/wiki/Animal_echolocation" title="Animal echolocation">echolocate</a>. Dory subsequently has flashbacks of life with her parents, and struggles to recall details. She finally remembers how she was separated from her parents: she overheard her mother crying one night, left to retrieve a shell to cheer her up, and was pulled away by an <a href="/wiki/Undertow_(water_waves)" title="Undertow (water waves)">undertow current</a>.
</p><p>Marlin and Nemo attempt to rescue Dory. With the help of two lazy, <a href="/wiki/British_English" title="British English">British</a>-accented <a href="/wiki/California_sea_lion" title="California sea lion">California sea lions</a> named Fluke and Rudder and a disfigured and utterly incompetent <a href="/wiki/Common_loon" title="Common loon">common loon</a> named Becky, they manage to get into the institute and find her in the pipe system. Other blue tangs tell them that Dory's parents escaped from the institute a long time ago to search for her and never came back, leaving Dory believing that they have died. Hank retrieves Dory from the tank, accidentally leaving Marlin and Nemo behind. He is then apprehended by one of the employees and unintentionally drops Dory into the drain, flushing her out to the ocean. While wandering aimlessly, she comes across a trail of shells; remembering that when she was young, her parents had set out a similar trail to help her find her way back home, she follows it. At the end of the trail, Dory finds an empty <a href="/wiki/Brain_coral" title="Brain coral">brain coral</a> with multiple shell trails leading to it. As she turns to leave, she sees her parents Jenny and Charlie in the distance. They tell her they spent years laying down the trails for her to follow in the hopes that she would eventually find them.
</p><p>Marlin, Nemo, and Hank end up in the truck taking various aquatic creatures to Cleveland. Destiny and Bailey escape from their exhibit to help Dory rescue them. Once on board the truck, Dory persuades Hank to return to the sea with her, and together, they hijack the truck and drive it over busy highways, creating havoc, before crashing it into the sea, freeing all the fish. Dory, along with her parents and new friends, return to the reef with Marlin and Nemo.

They are eventually picked up by staff members from the Marine Life Institute. Meanwhile, Fluke and Rudder's <a href="/wiki/Unibrow" title="Unibrow">unibrowed</a> neighbor, Gerald, due to having finally gotten on their rock without them knowing (as they had spent the entire film shooing him away whenever he tried to get on their rock) pops up and giggles goofily, as the <a href="/wiki/Iris_shot" title="Iris shot">iris</a> closes in on him, revealing the film's end.

There, she is confronted by an unwanted marriage proposal to Lord Ascot's son, Hamish, and the stifling expectations of the society in which she lives. Unsure of how to proceed, she pursues a rabbit wearing a blue waistcoat and accidentally falls into a large rabbit hole under a tree. She emerges in a forest where she is greeted by the <a href="/wiki/White_Rabbit" title="White Rabbit">White Rabbit</a>, <a href="/wiki/The_Dormouse" title="The Dormouse">the Dormouse</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Dodo_(Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland)" title="Dodo (Alice's Adventures in Wonderland)">Dodo</a>, the <a href="/wiki/List_of_minor_characters_in_the_Alice_series#Live_Flowers" title="List of minor characters in the Alice series">Talking Flowers</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Tweedledum_and_Tweedledee" title="Tweedledum and Tweedledee">Tweedledum and Tweedledee</a>.

At the Red Queen's citadel and palace, the Red Queen is unaware of Alice's true identity and therefore welcomes her as a guest. Alice learns that the <a href="/wiki/Vorpal_sword" title="Vorpal sword">vorpal sword</a>, the only weapon capable of killing the Jabberwocky, is locked inside the den of the Bandersnatch. The Knave attempts to seduce Alice, but she rebuffs him, causing a jealous Red Queen to order that Alice be beheaded. Alice obtains the sword and befriends the Bandersnatch by returning her eye. She then escapes on the back of the grateful Bandersnatch and delivers the sword to the White Queen. The Cheshire Cat saves the Hatter from the <a href="/wiki/List_of_minor_characters_in_the_Alice_series#The_Executioner" title="List of minor characters in the Alice series">executioner</a>, and the Hatter calls for rebellion against the Red Queen. The rebellion is quickly put down by the Jubjub bird, but the resistance flees to the White Queen's castle, and both armies prepare for battle.

</p><p>On the appointed day, the White Queen and the Red Queen gather their armies on a chessboard-like battlefield and send Alice and the Jabberwocky to decide the battle in single combat. Encouraged by the advice of her late father, Alice fights the Jabberwocky among the ruins surrounding the battlefield and finally jumps from the remains of a spiral staircase onto the Jabberwocky's neck and beheads it. During this fight, a catapult stone kills the Jubjub bird. As punishment for their crimes, the White Queen banishes the Red Queen and the Knave into exile together. The Knave attempts to kill the Red Queen, yet the Hatter protects the Red Queen from his attack. After the Hatter performs a celebration dance called Futterwacken, the White Queen gives Alice a vial of the Jabberwocky's purple blood whose power will bring her whatever she wishes. She decides to rejoin the everyday world after saying farewell to her friends. Back in England, Alice impresses Lord Ascot with her idea of establishing oceanic trade routes to <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, inspiring him to take her as his apprentice.

</p><p>In a world populated by <a href="/wiki/Anthropomorphism" title="Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> mammals, rabbit Judy Hopps from <a href="/wiki/Rural_area" title="Rural area">rural</a> Bunnyburrow fulfills her childhood dream of becoming a <a href="/wiki/Police_officer" title="Police officer">police officer</a> in <a href="/wiki/Urban_area" title="Urban area">urban</a> Zootopia. Despite being the academy <a href="/wiki/Valedictorian" title="Valedictorian">valedictorian</a>, Judy is delegated to <a href="/wiki/Parking_enforcement_officer" title="Parking enforcement officer">parking duty</a> by Chief Bogo, who doubts her potential because she is a rabbit. On her first day, she is hustled by a <a href="/wiki/Confidence_trick" title="Confidence trick">con artist</a> fox duo, Nick Wilde and Finnick.
</p><p>Judy abandons parking duty to arrest Duke Weaselton, a weasel who stole a bag of <a href="/wiki/Crocus" title="Crocus">crocus</a> bulbs known as <i>Midnicampum holicithias</i>. Bogo reprimands her, but an otter named Mrs. Otterton enters Bogo's office pleading for someone to find her husband Emmitt, one of fourteen <a href="/wiki/Predation" title="Predation">predators</a> who are missing. When Judy volunteers and Assistant Mayor Dawn Bellwether praises the assignment, Bogo has no choice but to let Judy take the case. He gives her 48 hours to find Emmitt Otterton on the condition that if she fails, she resigns.
</p><p>Judy blackmails Nick into assisting her by covertly recording his confession to <a href="/wiki/Tax_evasion" title="Tax evasion">tax evasion</a>, having ascertained from the 'last-sighting' photo of Otterton that Nick was the last to see him. They track Otterton to a limousine owned by crime boss Mr. Big, who reveals Otterton went "savage"—reverted to a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Feral_animal" title="Feral animal">feral state</a>—and attacked his chauffeur Manchas. At his home, Manchas mentions Otterton yelled about "night howlers" before the attack. Moments later, Manchas himself turns savage and chases the pair. Judy saves Nick by trapping Manchas and calls the ZPD for help, but when they arrive, Manchas has vanished. Bogo demands that Judy turn in her badge, but Nick reminds Bogo that Judy still has ten hours to solve the case.
</p><p>At City Hall, Bellwether allows Judy and Nick access to the city's traffic cameras. They discover Manchas was captured by wolves, who Judy surmises are the "night howlers". They locate the missing predators—all gone savage—imprisoned at Cliffside Asylum, where Mayor Leodore Lionheart hides them from the public while trying to determine the cause of their behavior. Lionheart and the asylum staff are arrested for false imprisonment and Bellwether becomes the new mayor.
</p><p>Judy, praised for solving the case, has become friends with Nick and asks him to join the ZPD as her partner. However, she upsets him at a press conference by suggesting a predatory biological cause for the recent savage behavior; her comments also incite hateful speech and discrimination against predators throughout Zootopia. Wracked with guilt for the consequences of her words, Judy quits her job and returns to Bunnyburrow.
</p><p>Back home, Judy learns that the night howlers are actually the crocus bulbs Weaselton stole, and they contain a neurotoxin that has severe <a href="/wiki/Psychoactive_drug" title="Psychoactive drug">psychotropic effects</a> on mammals, causing them to go savage. After returning to Zootopia and reconciling with Nick, the pair confront Weaselton, who (with persuasion from Mr. Big) tells them the bulbs he stole were for a <a href="/wiki/Sheep" title="Sheep">ram</a> named Doug. They find Doug in a laboratory hidden in the city subway, developing a drug made from night howlers, which he has been shooting at predators with a <a href="/wiki/Tranquillizer_gun" title="Tranquillizer gun">dart gun</a>.
</p><p>Judy and Nick obtain the serum as evidence, but before they can reach the ZPD, Bellwether confronts them in the Natural History Museum and takes the evidence, revealing herself as the mastermind behind a <a href="/wiki/Supremacism" title="Supremacism">prey-supremacist</a> conspiracy to frame predators as dangerous and savage. Bellwether traps Judy and Nick in an exhibition after Nick refuses to abandon an injured Judy. She shoots a serum pellet at Nick to make him attack Judy and summons the ZPD for help, but Judy and Nick have replaced the serum pellets in Bellwether's gun with blueberries. Enraged, Bellwether threatens to frame the pair for the attacks before discovering that Judy baited her into openly declaring her role in the attacks and recorded the confession with her recording device; Bellwether attempts to escape, only to find herself and her crooked group of cops surrounded by Chief Bogo and his loyal officers.
</p><p>Bellwether is arrested and sent to prison for her actions. Lionheart publicly denies knowledge of Bellwether's plot and states that his imprisonment of the savage predators was a "wrong thing for the right reason". With the cause of the epidemic identified, the savage animals are cured and Judy rejoins the ZPD. Nick graduates from the Zootopia Police Academy as the city's first fox police officer and becomes Judy's partner.

While Saruman presses concern to the more present matter of the Dwarves' quest, requesting that Gandalf put an end to it, Gandalf secretly reveals to Galadriel he had anticipated this and had the Dwarves move forward without him.

Pocketing the ring, Bilbo finds himself confronted by Gollum. They play a riddle game, wagering that Bilbo will be shown the way out if he wins or eaten by Gollum if he loses. Bilbo eventually wins by asking Gollum what he has in his pocket. Noticing his ring is lost, Gollum realizes that Bilbo possesses it and chases him. Bilbo discovers that the ring grants him invisibility, but when he has a chance to kill Gollum, Bilbo spares his life out of pity and escapes while Gollum shouts his hatred towards the hobbit Baggins.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the Great Goblin reveals to the Dwarves that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Azog" title="Azog">Azog</a>, an Orc war-chief who killed Thrór and lost his forearm to Thorin in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/War_of_the_Dwarves_and_Orcs" title="War of the Dwarves and Orcs">battle</a> outside the Dwarven kingdom of <a href="/wiki/Moria_(Middle-earth)" title="Moria (Middle-earth)">Moria</a>, has placed a bounty on Thorin's head. Gandalf arrives and leads the Dwarves in an escape, killing the Great Goblin. Bilbo exits the mountain and rejoins the company, keeping his newly obtained ring secret. The company is ambushed by Azog and his hunting party, and takes refuge in trees. Thorin charges at Azog, who overpowers and severely injures him with his <a href="/wiki/Warg_(Middle-earth)" title="Warg (Middle-earth)">Warg</a>.

The Joker interrupts the meeting to warn them that Batman is unhindered by the law, and offers to kill him in exchange for half of their money. The mob bosses disagree, and a bounty is placed on the Joker by Gambol. The Joker finds and kills Gambol, taking over his gang. The mob ultimately decides to take the Joker up on his offer. Batman finds Lau in Hong Kong and brings him back to Gotham to testify, allowing Dent to apprehend the entire mob. The Joker threatens to keep killing people unless Batman reveals his identity, and starts by murdering Police Commissioner <a href="/wiki/Gillian_B._Loeb" title="Gillian B. Loeb">Gillian B. Loeb</a> and the judge presiding over the mob trial. The Joker also tries to kill Mayor Anthony Garcia, but Gordon sacrifices himself to stop the assassination. Dent kidnaps one of Joker’s henchmen and threatens him with a seemingly deadly game of heads-or-tails using Dent's lucky coin, which is revealed to be heads on both sides. Dent learns that Rachel is Joker's next target.
</p><p>Bruce decides to reveal his secret identity to prevent more deaths. Before he can, however, Dent falsely announces that <i>he</i> is Batman. Dent is taken into protective custody, but the Joker appears and attacks the convoy. Batman comes to Dent's rescue and Gordon, who faked his death, apprehends the Joker, securing a promotion to Commissioner. Rachel and Dent are escorted away by detectives on Maroni's payroll; Gordon later learns that they never arrived home. Batman interrogates the Joker, who reveals that they have been trapped in separate locations rigged with explosives and that Batman must choose one to save. Batman races to save Rachel, while Gordon attempts to rescue Dent. Batman arrives at the building, but realizes that the Joker sent him to Dent's location instead. Both buildings explode, killing Rachel and disfiguring half of Dent's face. The Joker escapes with Lau, who leads him to the Mob's funds. The Joker burns the money before killing Lau and the Chechen.
</p><p>Coleman Reese, an accountant at <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Enterprises" title="Wayne Enterprises">Wayne Enterprises</a>, deduces that Bruce is Batman and threatens to publicize the information. Not wanting Reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the Joker threatens to destroy a hospital unless Reese is killed within an hour. All hospitals are evacuated and Gordon travels to secure Reese. The Joker, disguised as a hospital nurse, discovers Dent's ward and hands him a gun, convincing him to seek revenge for Rachel's death. The Joker then destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. Dent goes on a killing spree, deciding the fates of people he holds responsible for Rachel's death by flipping his lucky coin, which was disfigured on one face by the explosion. Dent eventually apprehends Gordon's family, believing Gordon's love for his family parallels his love for Rachel.
</p><p>After announcing that Gotham City will be subject to his rule by nightfall, the Joker rigs two evacuating ferries with explosives; one containing civilians and the other containing prisoners. The passengers have been supplied with a trigger to the other boat's explosives, and the Joker announces through an intercom that he will blow both ferries if one of them has not been destroyed by midnight. Batman finds the Joker by using a sonar device that spies on the entire city, with the reluctant help of <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Fox" title="Lucius Fox">Lucius Fox</a>. Both the civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while Batman apprehends the Joker after a brief fight. Before the police arrive to take the Joker into custody, he gloats that Gotham's citizens will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes public knowledge.
</p><p>Gordon and Batman arrive at the building where Rachel perished and find Dent threatening to kill Gordon's family. Dent again flips his coin and shoots Batman, spares himself, and aims to kill Gordon's son while claiming that Gordon's negligence is responsible for Rachel's death. Before he can flip his coin for the boy, Batman, who was wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the building to his death. Batman persuades Gordon to let him take responsibility for the killing spree to preserve Dent's heroic image. As the police launch a manhunt for Batman, Gordon destroys the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bat-signal" title="Bat-signal">Bat-signal</a>, Fox watches as the sonar device self-destructs, and <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred</a> burns a letter from Rachel saying she plans to marry Dent.

Ten years later, Harry has been battling a disjointed life with the Dursleys. After inadvertently causing an accident during a family trip to the zoo, Harry begins receiving unsolicited letters by owls. After the Dursleys escape to an island to avoid more letters, Hagrid re-appears and informs Harry that he is actually a wizard and has been accepted into Hogwarts against the Dursleys' wishes. After taking Harry to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Diagon_Alley" title="Diagon Alley">Diagon Alley</a> to buy his supplies for Hogwarts and a pet owl named Hedwig as a birthday present, Hagrid informs him of his past; Harry's parents <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix_(fictional_organisation)" title="Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)">James and Lily Potter</a> met their demise via a <a href="/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter#Unforgivable_Curses" title="Magic in Harry Potter">Killing Curse</a> at the hands of the malevolent and all-powerful wizard, <a href="/wiki/Lord_Voldemort" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a>. Harry, the only survivor in the chaos, thus becomes well-known in the wizarding world as "The Boy Who Lived".
</p><p>Harry is then taken to <a href="/wiki/London_King%27s_Cross_railway_station" title="London King's Cross railway station">King's Cross station</a> to board a train to Hogwarts, where he meets three other students: <a href="/wiki/Ron_Weasley" title="Ron Weasley">Ron Weasley</a>, whom he quickly befriends; <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a>, an intelligent witch born to <a href="/wiki/Muggle" title="Muggle">muggle</a> parents; and <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>, a child from a wealthy wizarding family whom he immediately clashes with. After arriving at school the students assemble in the Great Hall, where all the first-years are sorted by the <a href="/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Sorting_Hat" title="Magical objects in Harry Potter">Sorting Hat</a> between four houses: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hufflepuff" title="Hufflepuff">Hufflepuff</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ravenclaw" title="Ravenclaw">Ravenclaw</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a>. Although the Sorting Hat considers putting Harry in Slytherin, he is placed into Gryffindor alongside Ron and Hermione.
</p><p>At Hogwarts, Harry begins learning magic spells and discovers more about his past and parents. After recovering the <a href="/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Remembrall" title="Magical objects in Harry Potter">Remembrall</a> of Gryffindor student <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a>, Harry is recruited for Gryffindor's <a href="/wiki/Quidditch" title="Quidditch">Quidditch</a> team as a Seeker, an extremely rare feat for first-year students. While exploring the school one night, Harry, Ron, and Hermione discover a <a href="/wiki/Cerberus" title="Cerberus">giant three-headed dog</a> named Fluffy in a restricted area of the school. Ron then insults Hermione after being embarrassed by her in a charms lesson, causing Hermione to lock herself in the girls' bathroom. She is attacked by a marauding troll but Harry and Ron save her, befriending her in the process.
</p><p>The children later find out Fluffy is guarding the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Philosopher's Stone">Philosopher's Stone</a>, an object that can grant its owner immortality. Harry suspects that potions teacher and head of Slytherin House <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> is trying to obtain the stone in order to return Voldemort to physical form. Hagrid accidentally reveals to the trio that Fluffy will fall asleep if played music. Harry, Ron, and Hermione decide that night to try and find the stone before Snape. They discover an already asleep Fluffy and face a series of safeguards including a deadly plant known as Devil's Snare, a room filled with aggressive flying keys that bruise Harry, and a dangerous life-sized game of <a href="/wiki/Chess" title="Chess">chess</a> that almost kills Ron.
</p><p>After getting past the tasks, Harry discovers that it was <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> teacher <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Quirinus Quirrell</a> who was trying to claim the stone, and that Snape was actually protecting Harry all along. Quirrell removes his turban and reveals a weak Voldemort living on the back of his head. Through an enchantment placed by Dumbledore, Harry finds the stone in his possession. Voldemort attempts to bargain the stone from Harry in exchange for reviving his parents, but Harry refuses, causing Quirrell to attack. Harry kills Quirrell by burning his skin and reducing him to dust, after which Voldemort's spirit rises from Quirrell's ashes and knocks Harry unconscious.
</p><p>Harry recovers in the school hospital with Dumbledore at his side. Dumbledore explains that the stone has been destroyed and that Ron and Hermione are safe. Dumbledore also reveals how Harry was able to defeat Quirrell: when Harry's mother died to save him, her death gave Harry a love-based protection against Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances, tying them for first place with Slytherin. Dumbledore then awards ten points to Neville for attempting to stop the trio, granting Gryffindor the House Cup. Harry returns home for the summer, happy to finally have a real home in Hogwarts.
</p><p>A mysterious vehicle using a giant magnet steals a highly potent mutagen known as PX-41 from a secret laboratory in the Arctic Circle. The Anti-Villain League (AVL), led by Silas Ramsbottom, tries to recruit former super-villain Gru to track down the culprit and recover the mutagen. However, Gru refuses, claiming that he is now a legitimate businessman and the devoted father to Margo, Edith, and Agnes. Longing to resume his criminal life, Dr. Nefario, Gru's friend and assistant, leaves Gru for new employment. Gru reluctantly agrees to investigate the theft and works with undercover AVL agent Lucy Wilde.
</p><p>The pair begin their search in the Paradise Shopping Mall, disguised as bakery employees. Gru immediately suspects the Mexican restaurant owner, Eduardo Pérez, of being the infamous "El Macho", a legendary super-villain who supposedly died by riding a shark into the mouth of an active volcano with 250 pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest. Gru and Lucy break into Eduardo's restaurant at night but find no proof. Meanwhile, Agnes, who dreams of having a mother one day, believes that Gru will fall in love with Lucy. Gru denies it, saying his relationship with Lucy is only professional.
</p><p>Although holding Eduardo as his prime suspect, Gru agrees to pursue others, including wig merchant Floyd Eagle-san. After witnessing Eduardo's two-timing son, Antonio, woo Margo and invite everyone to his Cinco de Mayo party, Gru renews his focus on Eduardo. His neighbor, Jillian, sets him up on a dinner date with her vacuous friend Shannon. The date goes awry, but Lucy arrives and rescues Gru from being humiliated by shooting Shannon with a tranquilizer gun. While they take Shannon home, Gru and Lucy spend personal time together, and Gru falls in love with her.
</p><p>The next day, the AVL arrest Eagle-san after finding an almost-empty jar of the mutagen in his shop, and the investigation is closed by Ramsbottom. Lucy is reassigned to Australia and gives Gru her lipstick taser as a gift before leaving. A heartbroken Gru, having lacked the courage to ask Lucy out on a date, instead takes the girls to the Cinco de Mayo party. There, he follows Eduardo and discovers a secret musical steps-activated elevator, where he finally finds proof that Eduardo is El Macho.
</p><p>On her flight, Lucy, realizing that she has also fallen in love with Gru, jumps out of the plane and uses a hang-glider to reach the party. Gru discovers that El Macho, who has hired Nefario as a partner, has been abducting Gru's Minions and using the stolen PX-41 serum to make them rabid and indestructible. El Macho plans to launch rockets full of the mutated Minions into major cities in order to dominate the world. He offers Gru the chance to team up with him, but Gru walks away.
</p><p>Lucy later arrives at the party, but El Macho captures Lucy after Pollito, El Macho's pet chicken, retrieves her AVL ID badge from her purse. Nefario rejoins Gru, who fakes being captured with two other minions to help him enter El Macho's fortress. Nefario creates an antidote to the serum. Gru, Nefario, and the girls use it as a weapon to return the Minions to their normal state. El Macho then applies the mutagen on himself and turns into a monster, but Gru and Nefario defeat him using Lucy's lipstick taser and a fart gun.
</p><p>Gru finds Lucy strapped to a TNT-loaded shark rocket and starts to untie her, but Pollito launches the rocket, sending it flying towards the same volcano where El Macho previously faked his death. Lucy accepts Gru's invitation for a date, and the pair dive into the ocean seconds before the rocket enters the volcano and violently explodes. Gru rejoins the AVL, and he and Lucy eventually get married, giving Margo, Edith and Agnes a mother.
</p><p>In the Pride Lands of <a href="/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>, a pride of lions rule over the animal kingdom from Pride Rock. King Mufasa's and Queen Sarabi's newborn son, <a href="/wiki/Simba" title="Simba">Simba</a> (whose name is <a href="/wiki/Swahili_language" title="Swahili language">Swahili</a> for lion<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>), is presented to the gathering animals by Rafiki the baboon (with the colorful facial marking of a <a href="/wiki/Mandrill" title="Mandrill">mandrill</a>)<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-grasset_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-grasset-5">[5]</a></sup> who serves as the <a href="/wiki/Shamanism" title="Shamanism">shaman</a> and advisor. Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the "circle of life", which connects all living things. Mufasa's younger brother, <a href="/wiki/Scar_(The_Lion_King)" title="Scar (The Lion King)">Scar</a>, covets the throne and plots to eliminate both Mufasa and Simba, so he may become king. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala—to whom Simba is betrothed—into exploring a forbidden <a href="/wiki/Elephants%27_graveyard" title="Elephants' graveyard">elephants' graveyard</a>, where they are attacked by three <a href="/wiki/Spotted_hyena" title="Spotted hyena">spotted hyenas</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_characters_in_The_Lion_King#Shenzi,_Banzai_and_Ed" title="List of characters in The Lion King">Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed</a>, who are in league with Scar. Mufasa is alerted about the incident by his <a href="/wiki/Majordomo" title="Majordomo">majordomo</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Hornbill" title="Hornbill">hornbill</a> Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though upset with Simba, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba.
</p><p>Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of <a href="/wiki/Wildebeest" title="Wildebeest">wildebeest</a> into a stampede that will trample him. He informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing that king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge. Scar refuses to help Mufasa, instead sending him falling to his death. He then convinces Simba that the tragedy was Simba's own fault and advises him to leave the kingdom. He then orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing his three hyena minions and the rest of their large pack to live in the Pride Lands.
</p><p>Simba collapses in a desert and is rescued by <a href="/wiki/Timon_and_Pumbaa" title="Timon and Pumbaa">Timon and Pumbaa</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Meerkat" title="Meerkat">meerkat</a> and <a href="/wiki/Common_warthog" title="Common warthog">warthog</a>, who are fellow outcasts. Simba grows up in the jungle with his two new friends, living a carefree life under the motto "<a href="/wiki/Hakuna_matata" title="Hakuna matata">hakuna matata</a>" ("no worries" in <a href="/wiki/Swahili_language" title="Swahili language">Swahili</a>). Now a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reunite and fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a drought-stricken wasteland under Scar's reign. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as king. Realizing that he can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.
</p><p>Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who had just struck Sarabi. Scar taunts Simba over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to him that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame the hyenas for his actions; Simba spares his life, but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to toss him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. Afterwards, Simba takes over the kingship as rain begins to fall.
</p><p>Later, with Pride Rock restored to its usual state, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of life.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Mowgli" title="Mowgli">Mowgli</a> is a "man cub" raised by the wolf <a href="/wiki/Raksha_(The_Jungle_Book)" title="Raksha (The Jungle Book)">Raksha</a> and her pack, led by <a href="/wiki/Akela_(The_Jungle_Book)" title="Akela (The Jungle Book)">Akela</a>, in an Indian jungle ever since he was brought to them as a infant by the <a href="/wiki/Black_panther" title="Black panther">black panther</a> <a href="/wiki/Bagheera" title="Bagheera">Bagheera</a>. Bagheera trains Mowgli to learn the ways of the wolves, but the boy faces certain challenges and falls behind his wolf siblings, while Akela disapproves of him using human "tricks", like building tools, instead of learning the ways of the pack.
</p><p>One day, during the <a href="/wiki/Dry_season" title="Dry season">dry season</a>, the jungle animals gather to drink the water that remains as part of a truce during a drought that enables the jungle's wildlife to drink without fear of being eaten by their predators. The truce is disrupted when a fire-scarred <a href="/wiki/Bengal_tiger" title="Bengal tiger">Bengal tiger</a> named <a href="/wiki/Shere_Khan" title="Shere Khan">Shere Khan</a> arrives, detecting Mowgli's scent in the large crowd. Resentful against man for scarring him, he issues a warning that he will kill Mowgli at the end of the drought. After the drought ends, the wolves debate whether they should keep Mowgli or not. Mowgli decides to leave the jungle for the safety of his pack. Bagheera agrees with the decision and volunteers to guide him to the nearby man village.
</p><p>En route, Shere Khan ambushes them and injures Bagheera, but Mowgli manages to escape. Later, Mowgli meets an enormous python named <a href="/wiki/Kaa" title="Kaa">Kaa</a>, who hypnotizes him. While under her influence, Mowgli sees a vision of his father being killed by Shere Khan while protecting him, which also warns of the destructive power of the "red flower" (fire). Kaa attempts to devour Mowgli, but she is attacked by a large animal who rescues the unconscious Mowgli. Mowgli later awakens to find that the animal that rescued him from Kaa was a <a href="/wiki/Himalayan_brown_bear" title="Himalayan brown bear">himalayan brown bear</a> named <a href="/wiki/Baloo" title="Baloo">Baloo</a>. The two bond while retrieving some difficult-to-access honey, and Mowgli agrees to stay with Baloo until the winter season arrives. Meanwhile,  upon learning that Mowgli has left the jungle, Shere Khan throws Akela off to his death and threatens the pack to lure Mowgli out.
</p><p>Bagheera eventually finds Mowgli and Baloo and is shocked that Mowgli has not joined the humans as he had agreed, but Baloo calms him down and persuades both of them to sleep on it. During the night, Mowgli finds a herd of <a href="/wiki/Indian_elephant" title="Indian elephant">Indian elephants</a> led by <a href="/wiki/Hathi" title="Hathi">Hathi</a> gathered around a ditch and uses vines to save a baby elephant from the ditch. Although Baloo and Bagheera are impressed, Baloo realizes that he cannot guarantee Mowgli's safety after learning that he is being hunted by Shere Khan. Baloo agrees to push Mowgli away to get him to continue onward to the man village.
</p><p>Mowgli is kidnapped by a gang of monkeys known as the "<a href="/wiki/Bandar-log" title="Bandar-log">Bandar-log</a>", who present him to their leader, a giant ape named <a href="/wiki/King_Louie" title="King Louie">King Louie</a>. Assuming that all humans can make fire, King Louie offers Mowgli protection from Shere Khan in exchange for it. Baloo distracts King Louie while Bagheera tries to sneak him out, but their plan is discovered. As King Louie chases Mowgli through his temple, he informs Mowgli of Akela's death. King Louie's rampage eventually causes his temple to collapse on top of him.
</p><p>Furious that Baloo and Bagheera never told him about Akela's death, Mowgli goes to confront Shere Khan alone. He steals a lit torch at the village to use as a weapon and heads back to the jungle, accidentally starting a wildfire in the process. He confronts Shere Khan, who argues that Mowgli has made himself the enemy of the jungle by causing the wildfire. Mowgli throws the torch into the water, giving Shere Khan the advantage. Baloo, Bagheera, and the wolf pack intervene and hold Shere Khan off, giving Mowgli enough time to set a trap. He lures Shere Khan up a dead tree and onto a branch, which breaks under the tiger's weight, and Shere Khan falls into the fire to his death. Mowgli then directs the elephants to divert the river and put out the fire.
In the aftermath, Raksha becomes the new leader of the wolf pack. Mowgli decides to utilize his equipment and tricks for his own use, having found his true home and calling with his wolf family, Baloo and Bagheera.

</p><p>The crew travels to the Locker and rescues Jack. The crew encounters many dead souls, including Elizabeth's father <a href="/wiki/Weatherby_Swann" title="Weatherby Swann">Governor Swann</a>, who was executed by Beckett. Tia Dalma reveals that the Goddess Calypso charged Davy Jones with the job to guide the souls of those who died at sea to the next world. Once every ten years he could come ashore to be with the woman he loved. But he corrupted his purpose and was cursed to become a monster. The soul of Governor Swann reveals that the <i>Dutchman</i> must always have a captain.
</p><p>Returning to the living world, the <i>Pearl</i> stops at an island for fresh water, where the crew find the <a href="/wiki/Kraken_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" title="Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)">Kraken</a> lying dead on the beach, having been killed by Jones under orders from Beckett. They are then attacked by Sao Feng and Beckett's men. Through a complex series of deals, Elizabeth is handed over to Feng, who believes she is the goddess <a href="/wiki/Calypso_(mythology)" title="Calypso (mythology)">Calypso</a>, while the rest of the crew make for Shipwreck Cove aboard the <i>Pearl</i>. Jack throws Will off the ship as part of the plan to seize control of the <i>Dutchman</i>. Sao Feng tells Elizabeth that the first Brethren Court bound Calypso in human form after she betrayed her lover, Davy Jones. He plans to release her to defeat Beckett. Davy Jones attacks Feng's ship, the <i>Empress</i>, mortally wounding Feng in the process. Feng appoints Elizabeth his successor as Pirate Lord before dying. Elizabeth and the crew are locked in the brig of the <i>Dutchman</i>, where she finds a partially insane Bootstrap Bill Turner. In a moment of clarity, Bootstrap reveals that whoever kills Davy Jones must take his place, bound to serve the <i>Dutchman</i> forever. He reiterates that "the <i>Dutchman</i> must always have a captain." <a href="/wiki/James_Norrington" title="James Norrington">Admiral Norrington</a> frees Elizabeth and her new crew from the <i>Dutchman</i>, but is killed by Bootstrap Bill.
</p><p>The <i>Black Pearl</i> arrives at Shipwreck Cove, where Barbossa attempts to persuade the Brethren Court to release Calypso. Davy Jones visits Tia Dalma in the <i>Pearl</i>'s brig, revealing she is Calypso.

Barbossa frees Calypso, but when Will reveals it was Jones who betrayed her and made it possible for the first Court to imprison her, Calypso vanishes and summons an enormous <a href="/wiki/Whirlpool" title="Whirlpool">maelstrom</a>.
</p><p>The <i>Pearl</i> and the <i>Dutchman</i> battle in the maelstrom. Elizabeth and Will are wed by Barbossa. On board the <i>Dutchman</i>, Jones and Jack engage in a duel for control of Davy Jones' heart. Jones stabs Will, mortally wounding him. Jack gives up his chance for immortality and instead helps Will stab the heart, killing Jones, whose body falls into the maelstrom. Jack and Elizabeth escape the <i>Dutchman</i> as it is sucked into the maelstrom.
</p><p>As Beckett's ship, the <i>Endeavour</i>, approaches to destroy the <i>Pearl</i>, the <i>Dutchman</i> rises from the sea, now captained by Will; the crew has been freed from Jones' curse. Together, the two pirate ships destroy the <i>Endeavour</i>. A stunned Beckett goes down with his ship while his navy retreats. With Will now forever bound to escort souls lost at sea to the next world, he and Elizabeth bid farewell to each other on the beach of an abandoned island.

</p><p>In Brantford, <a href="/wiki/New_Hampshire" title="New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> (1996), teenager Alex Vreeke is given the Jumanji <a href="/wiki/Board_game" title="Board game">board game</a> by his father, who found it on a beach. Uninterested, he sets the game aside. That night, it transforms into a <a href="/wiki/Video_game" title="Video game">video game</a> <a href="/wiki/ROM_cartridge" title="ROM cartridge">cartridge</a> which catches Alex's attention when he is awakened by the Jumanji drum beats. When he begins playing it, he disappears into the game.
</p><p>Twenty years later, four students at Brantford High School are given detention: Spencer Gilpin and his former friend Anthony "Fridge" Johnson for cheating, Bethany Walker for making a phone call during class, and Martha Kaply for talking back to her gym teacher and refusing to participate. In the school basement, where they are serving their detention, Fridge discovers Alex's discarded video-game system, and he and Spencer decide to play. Although it has five <a href="/wiki/Avatar_(computing)" title="Avatar (computing)">playable characters</a>, they are unable to select the first one, so they choose two others, and convince the girls to play as the remaining two. When Spencer presses "Start", they are transported into the game.
</p><p>They land in a jungle, in the forms of their game avatars. Spencer is a tough, muscular explorer and archaeologist named Dr. Smolder Bravestone; Fridge is a diminutive zoologist named Franklin "Mouse" Finbar; Bethany is an overweight male cartographer named Professor Sheldon Oberon; and Martha is a female commando and martial arts expert named Ruby Roundhouse. They each have three lives marked on their arms and Bethany immediately loses one after being eaten by a hippo. Spencer deduces that if they lose all three, they die for real.
</p><p>They learn the game's story from <a href="/wiki/Non-player_character" title="Non-player character">NPC</a> Nigel: corrupt archeologist Russel Van Pelt stole the Jaguar's Eye, a magic jewel, from its shrine, cursing Jumanji. Nigel escaped Van Pelt with the jewel, and the players must return it to a jaguar statue to lift the curse, and call "Jumanji" to leave the game. Nigel warns them that Van Pelt will stop at nothing to retrieve the jewel, which gives him control of Jumanji's animals; Van Pelt himself is possessed by its power. They begin tackling the game's increasingly-difficult "levels", losing lives as they do so. The four are rescued by Alex, the missing fifth player, whose avatar is pilot Jefferson "Seaplane" McDonough. Taking shelter in a jungle house built by the game's previous player Alan Parrish, Alex believes that he has been in the game for a few months and is distressed to learn that it is really twenty years. The newcomers vow to help him return home. They break into a transportation shed, commandeering a <a href="/wiki/Helicopter" title="Helicopter">helicopter</a> to fly to the jaguar statue and return the jewel, but Fridge drops the jewel into a herd of white rhinoceros. Spencer sacrifices one of Fridge's lives, pushing him out of the helicopter as a distraction, and retrieves the jewel. Alex loses his last life when a mosquito bites him, but Bethany performs <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CPR" title="CPR">CPR</a> and transfers one of her lives to him.
</p><p>At the statue, the players are surrounded by a pack of jaguars and Van Pelt's forces. They outmaneuver their opposition while Spencer and Martha race to the statue. Van Pelt confronts Martha and demands the jewel, but she purposely gets a snake to bite her, allowing her to respawn and to get the jewel to Spencer. With the players on their last lives, they end the game, with Van Pelt disintegrating into a bunch of <a href="/wiki/Rat" title="Rat">rats</a>, and return to the school basement, though without Alex. They find the formerly-dilapidated Vreeke home restored and decorated for a Christmas family gathering. An adult Alex arrives, having returned to 1996 when the game ended. Now married with children, he reveals he named his eldest daughter after Bethany out of gratitude for saving his life.
</p><p>Spencer and Fridge reconcile, Bethany begins caring for others more than herself and plans a summer wilderness backpacking adventure, Martha and Spencer become romantically involved and the four are now friends after their experiences in the game. When they hear Jumanji's drumbeats, they bring the game behind the school and Fridge destroys it with a bowling ball to prevent anyone from playing it.

The trio escape their pursuers by apparating in the wilderness, but Ron is injured and cannot apparate again until he recovers.
</p><p>After unsuccessful attempts to destroy the Horcrux, the trio take turns wearing it to dilute its power. Harry sees a vision of Voldemort interrogating and killing the wand-maker <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gregorovitch" title="Gregorovitch">Gregorovitch</a>, who claims a teenage boy stole the legendary <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Elder_Wand" title="Elder Wand">Elder Wand</a> from his shop.

</p><p>Harry sees a Patronus in the form of a doe, which leads him to a frozen pond. Gryffindor's sword lies beneath the pond's ice, which Harry breaks and jumps into. The locket around his neck strangles Harry, but Ron arrives and rescues him. Harry uses <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parseltongue" title="Parseltongue">parseltongue</a> to open the Horcrux locket, which Ron eventually decides to destroy.

Hermione reads the story of the Hallows, after which the trio awkwardly attempt to leave but are stopped by Lovegood.

They are ushered along by Gandalf to the nearby home of <a href="/wiki/Beorn" title="Beorn">Beorn</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Shapeshifting" title="Shapeshifting">skin-changer</a> who can take the form of the bear. That night, Azog is summoned to <a href="/wiki/Dol_Guldur" title="Dol Guldur">Dol Guldur</a> by the Necromancer, who commands him to marshal his forces for war, so Azog delegates the hunt for Thorin to his son <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bolg" title="Bolg">Bolg</a>. The following day, Beorn escorts the company to the borders of <a href="/wiki/Mirkwood" title="Mirkwood">Mirkwood</a>, where Gandalf discovers <a href="/wiki/Black_Speech" title="Black Speech">Black Speech</a> imprinted on an old ruin. Heeding a promise he made to <a href="/wiki/Galadriel" title="Galadriel">Galadriel</a>, he warns the company to remain on the path and leaves to investigate the tombs of the <a href="/wiki/Nazg%C3%BBl" title="Nazgûl">Nazgûl</a>. Upon entering the forest, the dwarves lose their way and are ensnared by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Great_Spiders_of_Mirkwood" title="Great Spiders of Mirkwood">giant spiders</a>. Bilbo sets about freeing them with the help of his recently acquired <a href="/wiki/One_Ring" title="One Ring">invisibility ring</a>. He subsequently drops the ring and first begins to understand its dark influence after he brutally kills a creature to retrieve it.

They also capture the Dwarves and bring Thorin before their king <a href="/wiki/Thranduil" title="Thranduil">Thranduil</a>. Thorin confronts Thranduil about his neglect of the Dwarves of Erebor following <a href="/wiki/Smaug" title="Smaug">Smaug</a>'s attack 60 years earlier, and is consequently imprisoned with the other Dwarves. Bilbo, having avoided capture, arranges an escape using empty wine barrels that are sent downstream. While being pursued by the Wood-elves, they are ambushed by Bolg and his Orc party, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/K%C3%ADli" title="Kíli">Kíli</a> is wounded with a <a href="/wiki/Middle-earth_weapons_and_armour#Knives" title="Middle-earth weapons and armour">Morgul shaft</a>. They engage in a running three-way battle down the river, but ultimately the Dwarves are able to escape both groups of pursuers. Thranduil then seals off his kingdom when an Orc captive reveals an evil entity has returned and is amassing an army in the south, but Tauriel decides to leave and assist the Dwarves, and Legolas goes after her. Meanwhile, Gandalf and <a href="/wiki/Radagast" title="Radagast">Radagast</a> go to investigate the tombs of the <a href="/wiki/Nazg%C3%BBl" title="Nazgûl">Nazgûl</a>, which they find to be empty.
</p><p>The company are smuggled into <a href="/wiki/Esgaroth" title="Esgaroth">Esgaroth</a> by a bargeman called <a href="/wiki/Bard_the_Bowman" title="Bard the Bowman">Bard</a>, but are discovered raiding the town armory for new weapons. Thorin promises the Master, his councilor Alfrid, and the people of Laketown a share of the mountain's treasure, and it is revealed that Bard is a descendant of the last ruler of Dale, and possesses the last black arrow capable of killing Smaug. Kíli is forced to remain behind, tended to by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_Middle-earth_Dwarves#Fíli" title="List of Middle-earth Dwarves">Fíli</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_Middle-earth_Dwarves#Óin,_son_of_Glóin" title="List of Middle-earth Dwarves">Óin</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_Middle-earth_Dwarves#Bofur" title="List of Middle-earth Dwarves">Bofur</a>, as the remaining company receive a grand farewell. Meanwhile, Gandalf travels south to the ruins of <a href="/wiki/Dol_Guldur" title="Dol Guldur">Dol Guldur</a>, while Radagast leaves to warn <a href="/wiki/Galadriel" title="Galadriel">Galadriel</a> of their discovery at the tombs of the Nazgûl. Gandalf finds the ruins infested with Orcs and is ambushed by Azog. The Necromancer overpowers Gandalf and reveals himself as <a href="/wiki/Sauron" title="Sauron">Sauron</a>.
</p><p>Thorin and his remaining company reach the <a href="/wiki/Lonely_Mountain" title="Lonely Mountain">Lonely Mountain</a>, where Bilbo discovers the hidden entrance. He is sent in to retrieve the Arkenstone, and while doing so, he accidentally awakens Smaug. While trying to find Bilbo, Smaug reveals his knowledge of Sauron's return. Back in Laketown, Bard attempts to bring the black arrow to the town's launcher, as he fears what may happen when the Dwarves enter the mountain. However, he is arrested by the Master and Alfrid in the process and leaves his son to hide the arrow. Bolg and his Orc party infiltrate the town and attack the four Dwarves, but are quickly dispatched by Tauriel and Legolas. Tauriel then tends to Kíli, while Legolas leaves in pursuit of Bolg. Meanwhile, Gandalf watches helplessly as Azog and an Orc army march from Dol Guldur towards the Lonely Mountain.
</p><p>Back inside the mountain, during a long chase, Bilbo and the Dwarves rekindle the mountain's forge using Smaug's flames to create and melt a large golden statue of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thr%C3%B3r" title="Thrór">Thrór</a>, hoping to bury Smaug alive in the molten gold. They do so, but Smaug emerges from the gold, storms out of the mountain and <a href="/wiki/The_Hobbit:_The_Battle_of_the_Five_Armies" title="The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies">flies off to destroy Laketown</a> as Bilbo watches in horror.

Smaug's falling body crushes the fleeing Master of Laketown and his cronies, who were escaping on a boat laden with the town's gold. Bard reluctantly becomes the new leader of the people of Laketown, with the Master's conniving servant, Alfrid, acting as Bard's reluctant servant, as they seek refuge in the ruins of Dale, while <a href="/wiki/Legolas" title="Legolas">Legolas</a> travels to investigate <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_minor_places_in_Middle-earth#Mount_Gundabad" title="List of minor places in Middle-earth">Mount Gundabad</a> with <a href="/wiki/Tauriel" title="Tauriel">Tauriel</a>.

Thorin, hearing that Laketown survivors have fled to Dale, orders the entrance of the Lonely Mountain sealed off.

Legolas and Tauriel witness the march of Bolg's army, bolstered by Orc berserkers and giant bats.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Thranduil" title="Thranduil">Thranduil</a> and an Elf army arrive in Dale and form an alliance with Bard in order to reclaim a treasure once withheld from them by <a href="/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#Thrór" title="Middle-earth dwarf characters">Thrór</a>. Bard goes to the mountain and asks Thorin for the share of gold that he had previously promised the people of Laketown, but Thorin refuses. Gandalf arrives at Dale to warn Bard and Thranduil of the threat posed by Azog, but Thranduil dismisses him. Bilbo sneaks out of Erebor to hand the Arkenstone over to Thranduil and Bard so that they can trade it for the treasures they were promised and prevent a battle. When Bard's and Thranduil's armies gather at the gates of Erebor, offering to trade the Arkenstone for the promised treasures, Thorin angrily refuses to believe they have the Arkenstone until Bilbo admits giving it away and chides Thorin for letting greed cloud his judgement. Outraged by what he sees as betrayal, Thorin nearly kills Bilbo, but Gandalf appears and shames Thorin into releasing Bilbo. Thorin's cousin <a href="/wiki/D%C3%A1in_II_Ironfoot" title="Dáin II Ironfoot">Dáin</a> arrives with his Dwarf army, and a battle of Dwarves against Elves and Men ensues, until <a href="/wiki/Wereworms" title="Wereworms">Wereworms</a> emerge from the ground, releasing Azog's army from their tunnels. With the Orcs outnumbering Dáin's army, Thranduil and Bard's forces, along with Gandalf and Bilbo, join the battle, fighting the Orcs. However, a second front is opened when many Orcs, Ogres, and Trolls attack Dale, forcing Bard to withdraw his forces to defend the city, while Alfrid takes a bunch of gold and flees from Dale to his ultimate fate.
</p><p>Inside Erebor, Thorin suffers traumatic hallucinations before regaining his sanity and leading his company to join the battle. He rides towards <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ravenhill_(Middle-earth)" title="Ravenhill (Middle-earth)">Ravenhill</a> with Dwalin, Fíli, and Kíli to kill Azog; Bilbo follows them, using <a href="/wiki/One_Ring" title="One Ring">his magic ring</a> to move through the combat unseen. Meanwhile, Tauriel and Legolas arrive to warn the Dwarves of Bolg's approaching army. Fíli is captured, and Azog kills him as Bilbo and the other Dwarves are forced to watch. As Thorin engages Azog in a fight to the death, Bolg knocks Bilbo unconscious, overpowers Tauriel and then kills Kíli, who had come to her aid. Legolas battles Bolg and eventually kills him. Thorin kills Azog, but is fatally wounded in the process. The <a href="/wiki/Eagle_(Middle-earth)" title="Eagle (Middle-earth)">Great Eagles</a> arrive with Radagast and <a href="/wiki/Beorn" title="Beorn">Beorn</a> to fight the newly arriving Orc army, and the Orcs are finally defeated. Bilbo regains consciousness and makes peace with the dying Thorin. Tauriel mourns Kili, and Thranduil acknowledges their love. Legolas then tells Thranduil he must leave, and Thranduil advises him to seek out a Dunedain ranger in the north who goes by the name <a href="/wiki/Aragorn" title="Aragorn">"Strider"</a>.
</p><p>As Thorin's company begin settling back into Erebor (with Dáin now the king), and Dale begins to recover with Bard as the leader, Bilbo bids farewell to the company's remaining members and journeys home to <a href="/wiki/Shire_(Middle-earth)" title="Shire (Middle-earth)">the Shire</a> with Gandalf. As the two part ways on the outskirts of the Shire, Gandalf admits his knowledge of Bilbo's ring and warns him that magic rings are not to be used lightly. Bilbo returns to Bag End to find his belongings being auctioned off because he was presumed dead. He cancels the sale, but finds his home pillaged; he starts to tidy up and to settle back in. <a href="/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring" title="The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring">Sixty years later</a>, Bilbo receives a visit from Gandalf on his 111th birthday.
</p><p>A <a href="/wiki/Amphiprioninae" title="Amphiprioninae">clownfish</a> couple, Marlin and Coral, are admiring their new home in the <a href="/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" title="Great Barrier Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, and their clutch of hundreds of eggs, when a <a href="/wiki/Barracuda" title="Barracuda">barracuda</a> attacks.  Marlin is knocked unconscious, and wakes up to find Coral and all but one of the eggs eaten by the barracuda. He names this last egg <i>Nemo</i>, a name that Coral had chosen.
</p><p>On the first day of school, the overprotective Marlin embarrasses Nemo during a field trip. While Marlin talks to the teacher, Mr. Ray, Nemo sneaks away from the reef toward a boat and is captured by a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scuba_diver" title="Scuba diver">scuba diver</a>. As the boat departs, one of the divers accidentally knocks his <a href="/wiki/Diving_mask" title="Diving mask">diving mask</a> overboard.

The two encounter Bruce, Anchor and Chum, three reformed sharks who have renounced fish-eating diet. While at their <a href="/wiki/Twelve-step_program" title="Twelve-step program">progress meeting</a>, Marlin discovers the diver's mask and notices an address written on it. However, Dory and Marlin fight over the mask, accidentally giving Dory a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bloody_nose" title="Bloody nose">bloody nose</a>. The blood sends Bruce into an insane <a href="/wiki/Feeding_frenzy" title="Feeding frenzy">feeding frenzy</a>, and he attacks Marlin and Dory, who narrowly escape.
</p><p>Nemo is placed in an <a href="/wiki/Aquarium" title="Aquarium">aquarium</a> in a dentist's office, where he meets the "Tank Gang", a group of pet fish including <a href="/wiki/Porcupinefish" title="Porcupinefish">porcupinefish</a> Bloat, <a href="/wiki/Cleaner_shrimp" title="Cleaner shrimp">cleaner shrimp</a> Jacques, <a href="/wiki/Dascyllus_melanurus" title="Dascyllus melanurus">striped damselfish</a> Deb, <a href="/wiki/Royal_gramma" title="Royal gramma">royal gramma</a> Gurgle, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sea_star" title="Sea star">sea star</a> Peach, and <a href="/wiki/Yellow_tang" title="Yellow tang">yellow tang</a> Bubbles, led by <a href="/wiki/Moorish_idol" title="Moorish idol">Moorish idol</a>, Gill. The gang learn Nemo is to be given to the dentist's niece Darla, who has killed previous fish given to her. Gill devises a plan to escape: jam the aquarium's <a href="/wiki/Filter_(aquarium)" title="Filter (aquarium)">filter</a> with a pebble so the dentist will have to put the fish in plastic bags to clean the tank, then roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo attempts to jam the filter but fails, nearly dying in the process.
</p><p>The mask falls into a trench in the deep sea, where, while battling an <a href="/wiki/Anglerfish" title="Anglerfish">anglerfish</a>, Dory reads the address as "42 Wallaby Way, <a href="/wiki/Sydney" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>". To her own disbelief, Dory remembers the address despite her short-term memory loss. Dory and Marlin receive directions to Sydney from a school of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Silver_moony" title="Silver moony">moonfish</a>. On the way, they encounter a bloom of <a href="/wiki/Jellyfish" title="Jellyfish">jellyfish</a> that traps and nearly stings them to death. Marlin loses consciousness and awakens on the back of a sea turtle named Crush, who shuttles Marlin and Dory on the <a href="/wiki/East_Australian_Current" title="East Australian Current">East Australian Current</a>. Marlin tells the story of his journey to a group of young sea turtles led by Crush's son Squirt. News of his quest spreads across the ocean. Near the harbor, a <a href="/wiki/Pelican" title="Pelican">pelican</a> named Nigel flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's efforts. Inspired, Nemo makes a second attempt to jam the filter. He succeeds, but the dentist installs a new high-tech filter before the Tank Gang can escape.
</p><p>Marlin and Dory exit the East Australian Current and are engulfed by a <a href="/wiki/Blue_whale" title="Blue whale">blue whale</a>. Dory communicates with the whale, which carries them to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sydney_Harbour" title="Sydney Harbour">Sydney Harbour</a> and expels them through his <a href="/wiki/Blowhole_(anatomy)" title="Blowhole (anatomy)">blowhole</a>. They meet Nigel, who helps the pair escape from a flock of relentless <a href="/wiki/Gull" title="Gull">seagulls</a> and takes them to the dentist's office. Darla has just arrived, and the dentist is handing Nemo to her. Nemo plays dead to save himself as Nigel arrives, terrifying Darla and throwing the office into chaos. After Nigel is violently thrown out by the dentist, Gill helps Nemo escape into a drain that leads to the ocean.
</p><p>Having mistaken Nemo for dead, Marlin thanks Dory and starts his return journey. Dory meets Nemo when he reaches the ocean, but she has lost her memory. Eventually, Dory's memory returns when she reads the word <i>Sydney</i> on a drainpipe. She reunites Nemo with Marlin, but she is caught in a fishing net with a school of <a href="/wiki/Grouper" title="Grouper">grouper</a>. Nemo enters the net and orders the grouper to swim downward to break the net and they all escape. Later, having returned home, Marlin and Dory proudly watch Mr. Ray carry Nemo and all his new friends to school.
</p><p>Back at the dentist's office, the filter breaks down, and the tank gang escape into Sydney Harbor, unnoticed by the dentist.

At the Order's headquarters, Sirius mentions that Voldemort is after a special object he did not have during his previous attack.
</p><p>Harry's expulsion is reversed at a hearing of the Ministry of Magic and he returns to Hogwarts for his fifth year, where Minister of Magic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">Cornelius Fudge</a> has appointed a new <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> professor: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>.

Despite the concern of his best friends <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ron_Weasley" title="Ron Weasley">Ron Weasley</a>, Harry refuses to report Umbridge's punishment to Dumbledore, who has mysteriously distanced himself from Harry since the summer. As Umbridge's control over the school increases, Harry, Hermione and Ron form a secret group to train students in defensive spells, calling themselves "<a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore's Army">Dumbledore's Army</a>". Umbridge tasks the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a> students with exposing the group. Meanwhile, Harry and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cho_Chang" title="Cho Chang">Cho Chang</a> develop romantic feelings for each other.
</p><p>Harry has a vision involving an attack upon <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a>, from the point of view of Arthur's attacker. Concerned that Voldemort will exploit this connection to Harry, Dumbledore instructs <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> to give Harry <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Occlumency" title="Occlumency">Occlumency</a> lessons to defend his mind from Voldemort's influence. These end after Harry discovers through Snape's memories why Snape hated Harry's father James (who often ridiculed him). The connection causes Harry to further isolate himself from his friends. Meanwhile, Sirius' deranged <a href="/wiki/Death_Eater" title="Death Eater">Death Eater</a> cousin <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a> escapes from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> along with nine other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>.

Dumbledore escapes as Fudge orders his arrest. Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress.
</p><p>Harry's refusal to forgive Cho causes their relationship to fall apart. After seeing another vision where Sirius is tortured by Voldemort, Harry, Ron and Hermione rush to Umbridge's fireplace to alert the Order via the Floo Network but are caught by her. When Umbridge threatens to use the <a href="/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter#Unforgivable_Curses" title="Magic in Harry Potter">Cruciatus Curse</a> on Harry, Hermione tricks her into entering the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts#Forbidden_Forest" title="Hogwarts">Forbidden Forest</a> in search of Dumbledore's "secret weapon".

Voldemort appears, but Dumbledore arrives through the Floo Network moments before he can kill Harry. A duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore ensues, which destroys much of the Atrium while Bellatrix escapes.

</p><p>Harry decides to use his Liquid Luck potion to convince Slughorn to give up the memory Dumbledore needs. Harry views the memory with Dumbledore and learns that Voldemort wanted information for creating <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>, magical objects that could contain pieces of a wizard's soul and make them immortal. Dumbledore concludes that Voldemort successfully divided his soul into seven pieces by creating six Horcruxes, two of which have already been destroyed: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle%27s_diary" title="Tom Riddle's diary">Tom Riddle's diary</a> by Harry and <a href="/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Marvolo_Gaunt's_Ring" title="Magical objects in Harry Potter">Marvolo Gaunt's ring</a> by him.

He then overpowers Harry and reveals himself as the Half-Blood Prince before escaping.
</p><p>Harry returns to Hogwarts, where the students, staff, and a few guests mourn Dumbledore's death. He later reveals to Ron and Hermione that the locket Horcrux was a fake. The locket contains a message from "<a href="/wiki/Death_Eater#Regulus_Black" title="Death Eater">R.A.B.</a>", stating that he has stolen the real Horcrux with the intent of destroying it.

While tracking down the Hobbits in Fangorn, Aragorn's group encounters <a href="/wiki/Gandalf" title="Gandalf">Gandalf</a>, who, after succumbing to his injuries while killing the Balrog in <a href="/wiki/Moria_(Middle-earth)" title="Moria (Middle-earth)">Moria</a>, has been resurrected as Gandalf the White to help save <a href="/wiki/Middle-earth" title="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a>.
</p><p>Aragorn's group travels to Rohan's capital city Edoras, where Gandalf releases Théoden from Saruman's influence and Wormtongue is banished. After learning about Saruman's plans to wipe out Rohan with his Uruk-hai army, Théoden decides to move his citizens to <a href="/wiki/Helm%27s_Deep" title="Helm's Deep">Helm's Deep</a>, an ancient fortress that has provided refuge to Rohan's people in times past, while Gandalf departs to acquire the aid of the Rohirrim. Aragorn builds a friendship with Théoden's niece, <a href="/wiki/%C3%89owyn" title="Éowyn">Éowyn</a>, who quickly becomes infatuated with him. When the exodus comes under attack by <a href="/wiki/Warg_(Middle-earth)" title="Warg (Middle-earth)">Warg</a>-riding Orcs, Aragorn falls off a cliff into a river and is presumed dead. However, he is found by his horse <a href="/wiki/List_of_Middle-earth_animals#Brego" title="List of Middle-earth animals">Brego</a> and taken to Helm's Deep. The Uruk-hai army arrives at Helm's Deep that night, finding a makeshift army of civilians and Elves from <a href="/wiki/Lothl%C3%B3rien" title="Lothlórien">Lothlórien</a> waiting for them as a night-long battle follows. Using gunpowder-like explosives on a sewer drain that Wormtongue told Saruman about, the Uruk-hai breach the outer wall and force the remaining defenders to retreat into the inner castle.
</p><p>At Fangorn, Merry and Pippin, having met Gandalf in the forest and convincing Treebeard they were allies, are brought to an Ent Council where the Ents decide not to assist in the war. Pippin then tells Treebeard to take them to a route passing <a href="/wiki/Isengard" title="Isengard">Isengard</a>, where they witness the devastation caused to the forest by Saruman's war efforts. An enraged Treebeard summons the Ents and they storm Isengard, drowning the orcs by breaking their river dam and stranding Saruman in Orthanc. 
</p><p>At Helm's Deep, Aragorn convinces a despairing Theoden to ride out and meet the Uruks in one last charge. Gandalf and the Rohirrim then arrive at sunrise, turning the tide of the battle and decimating the Uruk-hai while those remaining flee and are slaughtered. Despite this victory, Gandalf warns that Sauron's retaliation will be terrible and swift.
</p><p>Meanwhile, becoming loyal to Frodo after taking him and Sam through the <a href="/wiki/Dead_Marshes" title="Dead Marshes">Dead Marshes</a>, Gollum convinces the Hobbits of another entrance besides the <a href="/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth" title="Minor places in Middle-earth">Black Gate</a>.

While passing through the besieged Gondorian city of <a href="/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth" title="Minor places in Middle-earth">Osgiliath</a>, Sam reveals that Boromir's death was because he was driven mad by and tried to take the Ring. An attacking <a href="/wiki/Nazg%C3%BBl" title="Nazgûl">Nazgûl</a> nearly captures Frodo, who momentarily attacks Sam before coming to his senses, forcing Sam to remind him that they are fighting for the good still left in Middle-earth. Faramir is impressed by Frodo's rekindled hope and releases them along with Gollum. While leading the hobbits once more, Gollum decides to take revenge on Frodo and reclaim the ring by leading the group to "<a href="/wiki/Shelob" title="Shelob">Her</a>" upon arriving at <a href="/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth" title="Minor places in Middle-earth">Cirith Ungol</a>.

</p><p>Beaver's idea became reality when Guinness employee <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Chataway" title="Christopher Chataway">Christopher Chataway</a> recommended University friends <a href="/wiki/Norris_McWhirter" title="Norris McWhirter">Norris</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ross_McWhirter" title="Ross McWhirter">Ross McWhirter</a>, who had been running a fact-finding agency in London.

</p><p>After the founding of <i>The Guinness Book of Records</i> at 107 <a href="/wiki/Fleet_Street" title="Fleet Street">Fleet Street</a>, London, the first 198-page edition was bound on 27 August 1955 and went to the top of the British best seller lists by Christmas.

Since then, <i>Guinness World Records</i> has gone on to become a record breaker in its own right; with sales of more than 100 million copies in 100 different countries and 37 languages, <i>Guinness World Records</i> is the world's best selling copyrighted book ever.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[11]</a></sup>
</p><p>Because the book became a surprise hit, many further editions were printed, eventually settling into a pattern of one revision a year, published in September/October, in time for Christmas. The McWhirters continued to compile it for many years. Both brothers had an encyclopedic memory; on the TV series <i><a href="/wiki/Record_Breakers" title="Record Breakers">Record Breakers</a></i>, based upon the book, they would take questions posed by children in the audience on various world records and were able to give the correct answer. <a href="/wiki/Ross_McWhirter#Assassination" title="Ross McWhirter">Ross McWhirter was assassinated</a> by the <a href="/wiki/Provisional_Irish_Republican_Army" title="Provisional Irish Republican Army">Provisional Irish Republican Army</a> in 1975.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[12]</a></sup> Following Ross' assassination, the feature in the show where questions about records posed by children were answered was called <i>Norris on the Spot</i>.

Scarlett learns that <a href="/wiki/Ashley_Wilkes" title="Ashley Wilkes">Ashley Wilkes</a>—whom she secretly loves—is to be <a href="/wiki/Cousin_marriage" title="Cousin marriage">married to his cousin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Melanie_Hamilton" title="Melanie Hamilton">Melanie Hamilton</a>, and the engagement is to be announced the next day at a barbecue at Ashley's home, the nearby plantation <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Oaks" title="Twelve Oaks">Twelve Oaks</a>.
</p><p>At the Twelve Oaks party, Scarlett privately declares her feelings to Ashley, but he rebuffs her by responding that he and Melanie are more compatible. Scarlett is incensed when she discovers another guest, <a href="/wiki/Rhett_Butler" title="Rhett Butler">Rhett Butler</a>, has overheard their conversation. The barbecue is disrupted by the declaration of war and the men rush to enlist. As Scarlett watches Ashley kiss Melanie goodbye, Melanie's younger brother Charles proposes to her. Although she does not love him, Scarlett consents and they are married before he leaves to fight.
</p><p>Scarlett is widowed when Charles dies from a bout of <a href="/wiki/Pneumonia" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Measles" title="Measles">measles</a> while serving in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Confederate_Army" title="Confederate Army">Confederate Army</a>. Scarlett's mother sends her to the Hamilton home in <a href="/wiki/Atlanta" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> to cheer her up, although the O'Haras' outspoken house slave Mammy tells Scarlett she knows she is going there only to wait for Ashley's return. Scarlett, who should not attend a party while in mourning, attends a charity bazaar in Atlanta with Melanie where she meets Rhett again, now a <a href="/wiki/Blockade_runner" title="Blockade runner">blockade runner</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" title="Confederate States of America">Confederacy</a>. Celebrating a Confederate victory and to raise money for the Confederate war effort, gentlemen are invited to bid for ladies to dance with them. Rhett makes an inordinately large bid for Scarlett and, to the disapproval of the guests, she agrees to dance with him.
</p><p>The tide of war turns against the Confederacy after the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg" title="Battle of Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a> in which many of the men of Scarlett's town are killed. Scarlett makes another unsuccessful appeal to Ashley while he is visiting on Christmas <a href="/wiki/Furlough" title="Furlough">furlough</a>, although they do share a private and passionate kiss in the parlor on Christmas Day, just before he returns to war.
</p><p>Eight months later, as the city is besieged by the <a href="/wiki/Union_Army" title="Union Army">Union Army</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Atlanta_Campaign" title="Atlanta Campaign">Atlanta Campaign</a>, Scarlett and her young house slave Prissy must deliver Melanie's baby without medical assistance after she goes into premature labor. Afterwards, Scarlett calls upon Rhett to take her home to Tara with Melanie, her baby, and Prissy; he collects them in a horse and wagon, but once out of the city chooses to go off to fight, leaving Scarlett and the group to make their own way back to Tara. Upon her return home, Scarlett finds Tara deserted, except for her father, her sisters, and two former slaves: Mammy and Pork. Scarlett learns that her mother has just died of <a href="/wiki/Typhoid_fever" title="Typhoid fever">typhoid fever</a> and her father has become incompetent. With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett vows she will do anything for the survival of her family and herself.
</p><p>As the O'Haras work in the cotton fields, Scarlett's father is killed after he is thrown from his horse in an attempt to chase away a <a href="/wiki/Scalawag" title="Scalawag">scalawag</a> from his land. With the defeat of the Confederacy, Ashley also returns, but finds he is of little help at Tara. When Scarlett begs him to run away with her, he confesses his desire for her and kisses her passionately, but says he cannot leave Melanie. Unable to pay the taxes on Tara implemented by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reconstruction_Era" title="Reconstruction Era">Reconstructionists</a>, Scarlett dupes her younger sister Suellen's fiancé, the middle-aged and wealthy mill owner Frank Kennedy, into marrying her, by saying Suellen got tired of waiting and married another suitor.
</p><p>Frank, Ashley, Rhett and several other accomplices make a night raid on a <a href="/wiki/Shanty_town" title="Shanty town">shanty town</a> after Scarlett is attacked while driving through it alone, resulting in Frank's death. With Frank's funeral barely over, Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she accepts. They have a daughter whom Rhett names Bonnie Blue, but Scarlett, still pining for Ashley and chagrined at the perceived ruin of her figure, lets Rhett know that she wants no more children and that they will no longer share a bed.
</p><p>One day at Frank's mill, Scarlett and Ashley are seen embracing by Ashley's sister, India, and harboring an intense dislike of Scarlett she eagerly spreads rumors. Later that evening, Rhett, having heard the rumors, forces Scarlett to attend a birthday party for Ashley. Incapable of believing anything bad of her, Melanie stands by Scarlett's side so that all know that she believes the gossip to be false. After returning home from the party, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk, and they argue about Ashley. Rhett kisses Scarlett against her will, stating his intent to have sex with her that night, and carries the struggling Scarlett to the bedroom. The next day, Rhett apologizes for his behavior and offers Scarlett a divorce, which she rejects, saying that it would be a disgrace. When Rhett returns from an extended trip to London, Scarlett informs him that she is pregnant, but an argument ensues which results in her falling down a flight of stairs and suffering a <a href="/wiki/Miscarriage" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a>. As she is recovering, tragedy strikes when Bonnie dies while attempting to jump a fence with her pony.
</p><p>Scarlett and Rhett visit Melanie, who has suffered complications arising from a new pregnancy, on her deathbed. As Scarlett consoles Ashley, Rhett prepares to leave Atlanta. Having realized that it was he she truly loved all along, and not Ashley, Scarlett pleads with Rhett to stay, but Rhett rebuffs her and walks away into the morning fog, leaving her in tears on the staircase, vowing to one day win back his love.
</p><p>In 2154, humans have depleted <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>'s natural resources, leading to a severe energy crisis. The Resources Development Administration (RDA for short) mines for a valuable mineral — <a href="/wiki/Unobtainium" title="Unobtainium">unobtanium</a> — on Pandora, a densely forested <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Habitable_moon" title="Habitable moon">habitable moon</a> orbiting the <a href="/wiki/Gas_giant" title="Gas giant">gas giant</a> Polyphemus in the <a href="/wiki/Alpha_Centauri" title="Alpha Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a> star system.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Horwitz2009_11-1"><a href="#cite_note-Horwitz2009-11">[11]</a></sup> Pandora, whose atmosphere is poisonous to humans, is inhabited by the <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere#Naʼvi" title="Pandoran biosphere">Na'vi</a>, a species of 10-foot tall (3.0 m), blue-skinned, <a href="/wiki/Wisdom" title="Wisdom">sapient</a> humanoids<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> that live in harmony with nature and worship a <a href="/wiki/Mother_goddess" title="Mother goddess">mother goddess</a> named Eywa.
</p><p>To explore <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere" title="Pandoran biosphere">Pandora's biosphere</a>, scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called "avatars", operated by genetically matched humans; Jake Sully, a paraplegic former <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_Marine" title="United States Marine">Marine</a>, replaces his deceased identical twin brother as an operator of one. Dr. Grace Augustine, head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement but accepts his assignment as a bodyguard. While protecting the avatars of Grace and fellow scientist Dr. Norm Spellman as they collect biological data, Jake's avatar is attacked by a <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere#Fauna" title="Pandoran biosphere">thanator</a> and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Witnessing an auspicious sign, she takes him to her clan, whereupon Neytiri's mother Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Colonel" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's <a href="/wiki/Private_military_company" title="Private military company">private security force</a>, promises Jake that the company will restore his legs if he gathers information about the Na'vi and the clan's gathering place, a giant tree called Hometree,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Script25_36-0"><a href="#cite_note-Script25-36">[36]</a></sup> which stands above the richest deposit of unobtanium in the area. When Grace learns of this, she transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/outpost" title="wikt:outpost">outpost</a>. Over the following three months, Jake grows to sympathize with the natives. After Jake is initiated into the tribe, he and Neytiri choose each other as mates, and soon afterward, Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he attempts to disable a bulldozer that threatens to destroy a sacred Na'vi site. When Quaritch shows a video recording of Jake's attack on the bulldozer to Administrator Parker Selfridge,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Script8and15_37-0"><a href="#cite_note-Script8and15-37">[37]</a></sup> and another in which Jake admits that the Na'vi will never abandon Hometree, Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed.
</p><p>Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biological_neural_network" title="Biological neural network">biological neural network</a> native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate before commencing the attack. While trying to warn the Na'vi, Jake confesses to being a spy, and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Seeing this, Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, frees Jake and Grace and airlifts them to Grace's outpost, but during the escape Quaritch fires at them, hitting Grace.
</p><p>To regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fictional_universe_in_Avatar#The_Tree_of_Souls" title="Fictional universe in Avatar">Tree of Souls</a> and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can be completed. Supported by the new chief Tsu'tey, Jake speaks to unite the clan and tells them to gather all of the clans to battle against the RDA. Noticing the impending gathering, Quaritch organizes a <a href="/wiki/Preemptive_war" title="Preemptive war">pre-emptive strike</a> against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives. On the eve of battle, Jake prays to Eywa, via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na'vi.
</p><p>During the subsequent battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy; but are rescued when <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Characters_and_wildlife_in_Avatar#Fauna" title="Characters and wildlife in Avatar">Pandoran wildlife</a> unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch, wearing an <a href="/wiki/Mecha" title="Mecha">AMP suit</a>, escapes from his own damaged aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation.
</p><p>With the exceptions of Jake, Norm and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora and sent back to Earth, after which Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.

They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[Note 1]</a></sup> Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard <i>Keldysh</i> and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard <i>Titanic</i>.
</p><p>In 1912 <a href="/wiki/Southampton" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>, 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fiancé Cal Hockley, and her mother Ruth board the luxurious <i>Titanic</i>. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve their family's financial problems and retain their high-class persona. Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class.
</p><p>Aware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cal's bodyguard, Mr. Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with an iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.
</p><p>Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Lovejoy slips the necklace into Jack's pocket and he and Cal accuse him of theft. Jack is arrested, taken to the <a href="/wiki/Master-at-arms" title="Master-at-arms">master-at-arms</a>' office, and handcuffed to a pipe. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.
</p><p>With the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.
</p><p>After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for only one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of <a href="/wiki/Hypothermia" title="Hypothermia">hypothermia</a><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Carlson_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Carlson-9">[8]</a></sup> but Rose is saved.
</p><p>With Rose hiding from Cal en route, the <a href="/wiki/RMS_Carpathia" title="RMS Carpathia">RMS <i>Carpathia</i></a> takes the survivors to New York City where Rose gives her name as Rose Dawson. Rose says she later read that Cal committed suicide after losing all his money in the <a href="/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929" title="Wall Street Crash of 1929">Wall Street Crash of 1929</a>.

</p><p>In 1938, Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman studying to become a nun at <a href="/wiki/Nonnberg_Abbey" title="Nonnberg Abbey">Nonnberg Abbey</a> in <a href="/wiki/Salzburg" title="Salzburg">Salzburg</a>. Her love of music and the mountains, her youthful enthusiasm and imagination, and her lack of discipline cause some concern among the nuns. The Mother Abbess, believing Maria would be happier outside the abbey, sends her to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children—Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. Liesl, the oldest, is won over after Maria protects her from discovery when she is nearly caught sneaking back into the house after meeting with Rolfe, a messenger boy she is in love with.
</p><p>While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children and takes them around Salzburg and the surrounding mountains, and teaches them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend, Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake that concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities, and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain orders her to return to the abbey. Just then he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. Afterwards, he apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay.
</p><p>Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes he enter them in the upcoming <a href="/wiki/Salzburg_Festival" title="Salzburg Festival">Salzburg Festival</a> but the suggestion is immediately rejected by the Captain as he is opposed to his children singing in public. He does agree, however, to organize a grand party at the villa. The night of the party, while guests in formal attire <a href="/wiki/Waltz" title="Waltz">waltz</a> in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional <i><a href="/wiki/L%C3%A4ndler" title="Ländler">Ländler</a></i> folk dance, he cuts in and dances with Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy while convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. Back at the abbey, when Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her life. After Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. The Captain's feelings for Maria, however, have not changed, and after breaking off his engagement the Captain marries Maria.
</p><p>While the Captain and Maria are on their honeymoon, Max enters the children in the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. When they learn that Austria has been annexed by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Third_Reich" title="Third Reich">Third Reich</a> in the <i><a href="/wiki/Anschluss" title="Anschluss">Anschluss</a></i>, the couple return to their home, where a telegram awaits informing the Captain that he must report to the German Naval base at <a href="/wiki/Bremerhaven" title="Bremerhaven">Bremerhaven</a> to accept a commission in the <a href="/wiki/Kriegsmarine" title="Kriegsmarine">German Navy</a>. Strongly opposed to the Nazis and the <i>Anschluss</i>, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately for <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. Many of the Von Trapps' friends are prepared to accept the new regime, including Rolfe, whom Liesl is devastated to see has joined the <a href="/wiki/Hitler_Youth" title="Hitler Youth">Hitler Youth</a>. That night, as the von Trapp family attempt to leave, they are stopped by a group of <a href="/wiki/Sturmabteilung" title="Sturmabteilung">Brownshirts</a> waiting outside the villa. When questioned by <i><a href="/wiki/Gauleiter" title="Gauleiter">Gauleiter</a></i> Hans Zeller, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven.
</p><p>Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slip away and seek shelter at the nearby abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Brownshirts soon arrive and search the abbey, and the family is discovered by Rolfe. Upon seeing Liesl, he hesitates raising the alarm long enough to allow the family time to flee, and the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When the soldiers attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start as two nuns have removed parts of the engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom.
</p><p>A group of alien botanists secretly visit <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> under cover of night to gather plant specimens in a California forest. When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, but in their haste, one of them is left behind. In a suburban neighborhood in the <a href="/wiki/San_Fernando_Valley" title="San Fernando Valley">San Fernando Valley</a>, a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves <a href="/wiki/Reese%27s_Pieces" title="Reese's Pieces">Reese's Pieces</a> candy to lure the alien to his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its <a href="/wiki/Planetary_system" title="Planetary system">planetary system</a> and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead <a href="/wiki/Chrysanthemum" title="Chrysanthemum">chrysanthemums</a>.
</p><p>At school the next day, Elliott begins to experience a psychic connection with the alien, including exhibiting signs of intoxication (because it is at his home, drinking beer and watching <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tom_%26_Jerry" title="Tom &amp; Jerry">Tom &amp; Jerry</a></i>), and he begins freeing all the frogs in his biology class. As the alien watches <a href="/wiki/John_Wayne" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a> kiss <a href="/wiki/Maureen_O%27Hara" title="Maureen O'Hara">Maureen O'Hara</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Quiet_Man" title="The Quiet Man">The Quiet Man</a></i> on television, Elliott then kisses a girl he likes in the same manner and he is sent to the principal's office.
</p><p>The alien learns to speak English by repeating what Gertie says as she watches <i><a href="/wiki/Sesame_Street" title="Sesame Street">Sesame Street</a></i> and, at Elliott's urging, dubs itself "E.T." E.T. reads a comic strip where <a href="/wiki/Buck_Rogers" title="Buck Rogers">Buck Rogers</a>, stranded, calls for help by building a makeshift communication device and is inspired to try it himself. E.T. receives Elliott's help in building a device to "phone home" by using a <a href="/wiki/Speak_%26_Spell_(toy)" title="Speak &amp; Spell (toy)">Speak &amp; Spell</a> toy. Michael notices that E.T.'s health is declining and that Elliott is referring to himself as "we".
</p><p>On <a href="/wiki/Halloween" title="Halloween">Halloween</a>, Michael and Elliott dress E.T. as a ghost so they can sneak him out of the house. That night, Elliott and E.T. head through the forest, where they make a successful call home. The next day, Elliott wakes up in the field, only to find E.T. gone. Elliott returns home to his distressed family. Michael searches for and finds E.T. dying next to a culvert. Michael takes E.T. home to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son's illness and the dying alien, just as government agents invade the house. Scientists set up a hospital at the house, questioning Michael, Mary and Gertie while treating Elliott and E.T. Their connection disappears and E.T. then appears to die while Elliott recovers. A grief-stricken Elliott is left alone with the motionless E.T. when he notices a dead chrysanthemum, the plant E.T. had previously revived, coming back to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael's friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bicycles. Suddenly facing a police roadblock, they escape as E.T. uses <a href="/wiki/Psychokinesis" title="Psychokinesis">telekinesis</a> to lift them into the air and toward the forest, like he had done for Elliott before.
</p><p>Standing near the spaceship, E.T.'s heart glows as he prepares to return home. Mary, Gertie, and "Keys", a friendly government agent, show up. E.T. says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, as she presents him with the chrysanthemum that he had revived. Before boarding the spaceship, he embraces Elliott and tells him "I'll be right here", pointing his glowing finger to Elliott's forehead. He then picks up the chrysanthemum, boards the spaceship, and it takes off, leaving a rainbow in the sky as everyone watches it leave.

Moses saves an elderly woman from being crushed not knowing that she is his biological mother, Yoshebel, and he reprimands the taskmaster and overseer Baka.
</p><p>Moses reforms the treatment of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Slaves" title="Slaves">slaves</a> on the project, but Prince <a href="/wiki/Ramesses_II" title="Ramesses II">Rameses</a>, Moses's adoptive brother, charges him with planning an insurrection. Moses says he is making his workers more productive, making Rameses wonder if Moses is the man the Hebrews are calling the Deliverer.
</p><p>Nefretiri learns from Memnet that Moses is the son of Hebrew slaves. She kills Memnet but reveals the story to Moses only after he finds the piece of <a href="/wiki/Levite" title="Levite">Levite</a> cloth he was wrapped in as a baby, which Memnet had kept. Moses follows Bithiah to Yoshebel's house where he meets his biological mother, Brother Aaron, and Sister Miriam.
</p><p>Moses learns more about the slaves by working with them. Nefretiri urges him to return to the palace so he may help his people when he becomes pharaoh, to which he agrees after he completes a final task. Moses saves Joshua from death by killing Baka, telling Joshua that he too is Hebrew. The confession is witnessed by the overseer <a href="/wiki/Dathan" title="Dathan">Dathan</a>, who then reports to Rameses. After being arrested, Moses explains that he is not the Deliverer, but would free the slaves if he could. Sethi banishes Moses to the desert leaving Rameses as the sole heir. Yoshebel dies sometime later.
</p><p>Moses makes his way across the desert to a well in <a href="/wiki/Midian" title="Midian">Midian</a>. After defending seven sisters from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Amalekites" title="Amalekites">Amalekites</a>, Moses is housed with the girls' father <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jethro_(Bible)" title="Jethro (Bible)">Jethro</a>, a Bedouin sheik, who worships the God of Abraham.

While farming, Moses sees the <a href="/wiki/Burning_bush" title="Burning bush">burning bush</a> on the summit of <a href="/wiki/Mount_Sinai" title="Mount Sinai">Mount Sinai</a> and hears the voice of God. Moses returns to Egypt to free the Hebrews.
</p><p>Moses comes before Rameses, now pharaoh, to win the slaves' freedom, turning his staff into a <a href="/wiki/Cobra" title="Cobra">cobra</a>. <a href="/wiki/Jannes_and_Jambres" title="Jannes and Jambres">Jannes</a> performs the same trick with his staves, but Moses's snake swallows his. Rameses prohibits straw from being provided to the Hebrews to make their bricks. Nefretiri rescues Moses from being stoned to death by the Hebrews wherein he reveals that he is married.
</p><p>Egypt is visited by plagues. Moses turns the river Nile to blood at a festival of <a href="/wiki/Khnum" title="Khnum">Khnum</a> and brings burning hail down upon Pharaoh's palace. Moses warns him the next plague to fall upon Egypt will be summoned by Pharaoh himself. Enraged at the plagues, Rameses orders all first-born Hebrews to die, but a cloud of death instead kills all the firstborn of Egypt, including the child of Rameses and Nefretiri. Angrily, Pharaoh exiles the Hebrews, which begins <a href="/wiki/The_Exodus" title="The Exodus">the Exodus</a> from Egypt.
</p><p>Rameses takes his army and pursues the Hebrews to the <a href="/wiki/Red_Sea" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a>. Moses uses God's help to stop the Egyptians with a pillar of fire and parts the Red Sea. After the Hebrews make it to safety, Moses releases the walls of water, drowning the Egyptian army. A devastated Rameses returns empty-handed to Nefretiri, stating that he now acknowledges Moses's god as God.
</p><p>Moses again ascends the mountain with Joshua. Impatiently, Dathan urges a reluctant Aaron to construct a <a href="/wiki/Golden_calf" title="Golden calf">golden calf</a> idol as a gift for Rameses. A wild and decadent orgy is held by most of the Hebrews.
</p><p>Moses sees the <a href="/wiki/Ten_Commandments" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a> created by God in two stone tablets. Moses descends from the mountain to the sight of decadence.

Yevgraf believes a young woman, Tanya Komarova (<a href="/wiki/Rita_Tushingham" title="Rita Tushingham">Rita Tushingham</a>), may be his niece and tells her the story of her father's life.
</p><p>After the burial of his mother in rural Russia, the orphaned Yuri Zhivago is taken in by his mother's friends in <a href="/wiki/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>: Alexander (<a href="/wiki/Ralph_Richardson" title="Ralph Richardson">Ralph Richardson</a>) and Anna Gromeko (<a href="/wiki/Siobh%C3%A1n_McKenna" title="Siobhán McKenna">Siobhán McKenna</a>), and their daughter Tonya (<a href="/wiki/Geraldine_Chaplin" title="Geraldine Chaplin">Geraldine Chaplin</a>).
</p><p>In 1913, Zhivago, as a medical student in training, but a poet at heart, meets Tonya as she returns to Moscow after a long trip to Paris. Lara, only 17, is involved in an affair with the older and well-connected Victor Ippolitovich Komarovsky (<a href="/wiki/Rod_Steiger" title="Rod Steiger">Rod Steiger</a>), a friend of her mother's (<a href="/wiki/Adrienne_Corri" title="Adrienne Corri">Adrienne Corri</a>).

Pasha runs to Lara, whom he wants to marry, to treat his wound. He asks her to hide a gun he picked up at the demonstration.
</p><p>Lara's mother discovers her affair with Komarovsky and attempts suicide. Komarovsky summons help from his physician (<a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_Keen" title="Geoffrey Keen">Geoffrey Keen</a>), Zhivago's former professor, whom he accompanies back to Lara's home to treat her mother. When Komarovsky learns of Lara's intentions to marry Pasha, he tries to dissuade Lara, and then rapes her. In revenge, the humiliated Lara takes the pistol she has been hiding for Pasha and shoots Komarovsky at a Christmas Eve party, wounding him. Komarovsky insists no action be taken against Lara, who is escorted out by Pasha. Zhivago tends Komarovsky's wound. Although enraged and devastated by Lara's affair with Komarovsky, Pasha marries Lara, and they have a daughter named Katya.
</p><p>During <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, Yevgraf Zhivago is sent by the <a href="/wiki/Bolsheviks" title="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a> to subvert the <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Russian_Army" title="Imperial Russian Army">Imperial Russian Army</a>.

</p><p>During the <a href="/wiki/February_Revolution" title="February Revolution">February Revolution</a> in 1917, Zhivago enlists Lara's help to tend to the wounded. Together they run a field hospital for six months, during which time radical changes ensue throughout Russia as <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> arrives in Moscow. Before their departure, Yuri and Lara fall in love, but Yuri remains true to Tonya, who became his wife.
</p><p>After the war, Yuri returns to his wife Tonya, son Sasha, and Alexander (Anna has since died), whose house in Moscow has been divided into <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tenements" title="Tenements">tenements</a> by the new Soviet government. Yevgraf, now a member of the <a href="/wiki/Cheka" title="Cheka">Cheka</a>, informs him his poems have been condemned by Soviet censors as antagonistic to <a href="/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">Communism</a>. Yevgraf arranges for passes and documents in order for Yuri and his family to escape from the new political capital of Moscow to the far-away Gromeko estate at Varykino, in the <a href="/wiki/Ural_Mountains" title="Ural Mountains">Ural Mountains</a>. Zhivago, Tonya, Sasha, and Alexander board a heavily guarded cattle train, at which time they are informed that they will be travelling through contested territory, which is being secured by the infamous Bolshevik commander named Strelnikov, who is, in fact, Pasha Antipov.
</p><p>While the train is stopped early one morning, Zhivago wanders away. He stumbles across the <a href="/wiki/Armoured_train" title="Armoured train">armoured train</a> of Strelnikov sitting on a hidden siding. Yuri is summoned before Strelnikov, whom he recognizes as the former Pasha Antipov. During a tense interview, Strelnikov informs Yuri that his estranged wife Lara is now living in the town of Yuriatin, then occupied by the anti-Communist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/White_Army" title="White Army">White Army</a> forces. He permits Zhivago to return to his family, although it is hinted by Strelnikov's right-hand man that most people interrogated by Strelnikov end up being shot.
</p><p>The family lives a peaceful life in a cottage at the Varykino estate until Zhivago finds Lara in nearby Yuriatin, at which point they surrender to their long-repressed feelings. When Tonya becomes pregnant, Yuri breaks off with Lara, only to be abducted and conscripted into service by Communist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Partisans_(military)" title="Partisans (military)">partisans</a>.
</p><p>After two years, Zhivago at last deserts and trudges through the deep snow to Yuriatin where he finds Lara. Lara tells Yuri that Tonya had discovered her while searching for him, and that his family is now in Moscow. She reveals a sealed letter Tonya had mailed to Lara 6 months ago to give to Yuri: Tonya, her father, and their children are being deported and will live in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>. Yuri and Lara renew their relationship.
</p><p>One night, Komarovsky arrives and informs them they are being watched by the Cheka due to Lara's connection by marriage to Strelnikov and Yuri's "counter-revolutionary" poetry and desertion. Komarovsky offers Yuri and Lara his help in leaving Russia. They refuse. Instead, they return to the abandoned Varykino estate, taking up residence in the banned main house, where Yuri begins writing the "Lara" poems. These will later make him famous but also incur government displeasure. Komarovsky reappears and tells Yuri that Strelnikov was captured only five miles away while apparently returning to Lara, but then committed suicide en route to his own execution. Therefore, Lara is in immediate danger of execution herself, as the Cheka had only left her free to lure Strelnikov out of hiding. Zhivago sends Lara and Katya away with Komarovsky, who has been appointed a government official in the nominally independent <a href="/wiki/Far_Eastern_Republic" title="Far Eastern Republic">Far Eastern Republic</a> of the early 1920s. Refusing to accompany a man he despises, Yuri remains behind to face his fate.
</p><p>Years later, Yevgraf finds a sick and destitute Yuri in Moscow during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stalinist_era" title="Stalinist era">Stalinist era</a> and gives him a new suit and a job. While riding a tram, Yuri spots a woman he surely thinks is Lara walking on a nearby street. Unable to call her from the tram, Yuri struggles to get off at the next stop. Yuri runs after her but suffers a fatal heart attack before he can even signal to her, and the woman walks away oblivious to Yuri's presence. Yuri's funeral is well attended, a surprise to Yevgraf as Yuri's poetry was officially "unobtainable at the time". Lara approaches Yevgraf at the funeral and reveals she had given birth to Yuri's daughter, but lost her in the collapse of the <a href="/wiki/Occupation_of_Mongolia" title="Occupation of Mongolia">White-controlled government in Mongolia</a>. After vainly looking over hundreds of orphans with Yevgraf's help, Lara disappears during <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Great_Purge" title="Great Purge">Great Purge</a> of the late 1930s, and "died or vanished somewhere ... in one of the <a href="/wiki/Gulag" title="Gulag">labour camps</a>", according to Yevgraf.
</p><p>While Yevgraf strongly feels that Tanya Komarova is Yuri and Lara's daughter, he is still not convinced. But as Tanya leaves, Yevgraf notices that she carries a <a href="/wiki/Balalaika" title="Balalaika">balalaika</a>, an instrument that Yuri's mother was especially gifted at playing. Questioning her further, he learns that Tanya is self-taught — in fact, her fiancé proclaims her an 'artist' with the balalaika. Yevgraf smiles, "Ah. Then it's a gift", thereby implying she truly must be Yuri and Lara's daughter after all.
</p><p>During a beach party at dusk on Amity Island, <a href="/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a>, a young woman, Chrissie Watkins, goes <a href="/wiki/Nude_swimming" title="Nude swimming">skinny dipping</a> in the ocean. While <a href="/wiki/Treading_water" title="Treading water">treading water</a>, she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner's ruling that the death was due to a <a href="/wiki/Shark_attack" title="Shark attack">shark attack</a> leads police chief Martin Brody to close the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly thereafter. A bounty is placed on the shark, prompting an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, and confirms her death was caused by a shark—an unusually large one.
</p><p>When local fishermen catch a <a href="/wiki/Tiger_shark" title="Tiger shark">tiger shark</a>, the mayor proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes that it is the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable <a href="/wiki/Great_white_shark" title="Great white shark">great white shark</a>'s tooth embedded in the submerged hull. He drops it in fright after encountering a partial corpse. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's claims that a huge great white shark is responsible for the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank in which the presence of a shark is simulated, the real shark enters a nearby <a href="/wiki/Estuary" title="Estuary">estuary</a>, killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces Vaughn to hire Quint.
</p><p>Quint, Brody, and Hooper set out on Quint's boat, the <i>Orca</i>, to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a <a href="/wiki/Chumming" title="Chumming">chum</a> line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating its length at 25 feet (7.6 m) and weight at 3 tons, harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.
</p><p>At nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars and Quint reveals that he survived the <a href="/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)" title="USS Indianapolis (CA-35)">USS <i>Indianapolis</i></a>. The shark returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull, and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he intentionally pushes the damaged engine past the safety limits and the overtaxed engine fails.
</p><p>With the <i>Orca</i> slowly sinking, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on <a href="/wiki/Scuba_set" title="Scuba set">scuba gear</a> and enters the water in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shark-proof_cage" title="Shark-proof cage">shark-proof cage</a>, intending to lethally inject the shark with <a href="/wiki/Strychnine" title="Strychnine">strychnine</a>, using a hypodermic spear. The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly and devours Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody jams a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion obliterates the shark. Hooper surfaces, and he and Brody paddle back to Amity Island clinging to the remaining barrels.

</p><p><i>Because the film has been lost, the following summary is reconstructed from a description in a contemporary film magazine.</i>
</p><p>Cleopatra (Bara), the Siren of Egypt, by a clever ruse reaches Caesar (Leiber) and he falls victim to her charms. They plan to rule the world together, but then Caesar falls. Cleopatra's life is desired by the church, as the wanton woman's rule has become intolerable. Pharon (Roscoe), a high priest, is given a sacred dagger to take her life. He gives her his love instead and, when she is in need of some money, leads her to the tomb of his ancestors, where she tears the treasure from the breast of the <a href="/wiki/Mummy" title="Mummy">mummy</a>. With this wealth she goes to Rome to meet Antony (Hall). He leaves the affairs of state and travels to Alexandria with her, where they revel. Antony is recalled to Rome and married to Octavia (Blinn), but his soul cries out for Cleopatra. He sends her a message to arm her ships and meet him at Actium, where they <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Actium" title="Battle of Actium">battle</a> the opposing forces. They are overpowered, and flee to Alexandria. There they are captured by Octavius (De Vries), and Antony dies in Cleopatra's arms. Before Cleopatra is to be dragged behind the wheels of Octavius' chariot, Pharon the priest, who has never ceased to love her, brings her the serpent that she joyously brings to her breast, dying royally with her crown on her head and scepter in her hand as becomes Egypt.
</p><p>Mickey (Normand) is an adult orphan who has been raised since girlhood in poverty near Feather River, California by an unsuccessful miner, Joe Meadows, and his housekeeper, Minnie. Mickey is the free-spirited, uncultured daughter of the miner's deceased partner.  Meadows took charge of Mickey at his dying partner's request.  Mickey is sent to live in Great Neck, Long Island—part of suburban <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>—with her aunt (Mrs. Geoffrey Drake) and her family. Mrs. Drake is under the impression that Mickey is wealthy and well refined.  When Mickey arrives at her aunt's luxurious home, the aunt is disappointed that she is not well-to-do and puts her to work as a servant.  Mickey's presence there sparks an awkward love triangle involving her, her cousin (Elsie Drake), and young mining executive Herbert Thornhill (Wheeler Oakman) whom Mickey first encountered in California.  Just after Mickey is sent packing, a telegram arrives for her announcing that a vein has been struck on Joe's Tomboy mine and she is suddenly worth millions.  Mrs. Drake's opinion of Mickey changes quickly and she is welcomed back—in the hope she and Mrs Drake's feckless son, Reggie, will become a couple.  Herbert had recently proposed to Elsie, but realizes he truly loves Mickey.  Shortly afterward, Herbert receives a telegram from his lawyer, Tom Rawlings, explaining that his mining claims are now invalid and thus worthless.  Elsie and Mrs. Drake find the telegram and call off the wedding because Herbert is now bankrupt.  Herbert tries to regain his fortune by borrowing $5,000 and betting it on a horse race.  The race is rigged—and Mickey finds out about the plot.  Just as the race is about to begin, Mickey dresses in jockey silks, unhorses the crooked jockey, and tries to win the race by riding it for Herbert.  Just as it appears Mickey's horse will win, she falls from her mount.  Some time later Mickey reluctantly goes horseback riding with Reggie who tries to molest her in an abandoned house. Herbert arrives on the scene, battles Reggie, and rescues Mickey as she is dangling dangerously from the rooftop.  Mickey and Herbert are married.  As they depart on their honeymoon, a note arrives from lawyer Rawlings explaining the earlier telegram about his mining interests being worthless was a ruse designed to get Herbert out of his loveless engagement to Elsie Drake.  The film ends with both Mickey and Herbert happily in love, wed, and exceedingly wealthy.
</p><p>The film takes place in a small, <a href="/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a> town in 1919 (the Broadway play 1914), where a group of con men plan to use a faith healer to collect money.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Chinatown,_Manhattan" title="Chinatown, Manhattan">Chinatown</a>, four crooks conspire to swindle a small New England town. The gang consists of Tom Burke (Thomas Meighan), the head of the group; Rose (Betty Compson), a con artist posing as a street walker; "The Dope" (J.M. Dumont), who pretends to pimp Rose; and The Frog (Lon Chaney), a contortionist.
</p><p>The plan is clear: in a small town outside of Boston there is a Patriarch (Joseph Dowling) who has been healing people. The group heads to the town and plans to use the Patriarch in a faith healing scheme. When the townspeople gather to see the Patriarch heal the sick, the Frog is there, posing as a cripple. As he crawls to the path of the man, his limbs become straightened and soon he walks to the Patriarch, supposedly healed. Unexpectedly, a crippled boy, his faith in the Patriarch overpowering him, loses his crutches and runs to the Patriarch.
</p><p>The story spreads across the country (mostly on account of Burke), and people flock in from all over to visit the Patriarch and be healed. When a millionaire, Richard King (W. Lawson Butt), brings his sister to be healed, he gives Burke $50,000 after the Patriarch cures her. During this visit, King meets Rose, and the two fall in love.
</p><p>Meanwhile, all is not well with Burke. One by one, he sees his gang disbanding because, unbeknownst to him, the healing power of the Patriarch is at work. The Dope gives up his drug addiction, The Frog gives up his life of crime and takes care of a widow left all alone, and Rose laments King's departure.
</p><p>Burke becomes jealous, but when King returns to propose marriage to Rose, she realizes that she loves Burke.  The Patriarch dies, and the two lovers begin anew.

Then Lennox shows up lusting for another local girl, Kate. Seeing Anna, he tries to get her to leave, but she refuses to go, although she promises to say nothing about his past.
</p><p>Finally, Squire Bartlett learns of Anna's past from Martha, the town gossip.  In his anger, he tosses Anna out into a snow storm.  Before she goes, she fingers the respected Lennox as her despoiler and the father of her dead baby.  Anna becomes lost in the raging storm while David leads a search party.  In the famous climax, the unconscious Anna floats on an ice floe down a river towards a waterfall, until rescued at the last moment by David, who marries her in the final scene.

Madariaga then slides to the floor, drunk. The woman laughs at Madariaga. Julio casts her aside in scorn and helps his grandfather home.
</p><p>Sometime later, Madariaga dies. The extended family breaks up, one half returning to <a href="/wiki/Germany" title="Germany">Germany</a> and the other to <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, Julio enjoys a somewhat shiftless life as a would-be <a href="/wiki/Artist" title="Artist">artist</a> and sensation at the local tea dances. He falls in love with Marguerite Laurier (<a href="/wiki/Alice_Terry" title="Alice Terry">Alice Terry</a>), the unhappy and much younger wife (by an arranged marriage) of Etienne Laurier, a friend of Julio's father. The affair is discovered, and Marguerite's husband agrees to give her a divorce to avoid a scandal. It seems as though Julio and Marguerite will be able to marry, but both end up getting caught up in the start of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Great_War" title="Great War">Great War</a>.

Marcello is to be executed in the morning, but his life is spared when the French Army counterattacks in the "<a href="/wiki/First_Battle_of_the_Marne" title="First Battle of the Marne">Miracle of the Marne</a>".

Back in Paris, Marguerite considers abandoning the blinded Etienne, but Julio's ghost guides her to continue her care for him.
</p><p>The ending scene shows Marcelo Desnoyers mourning over his son's grave. The man who lived upstairs from Julio watches over him. Marcelo asks him, "Did you know my son?" The man, with a remorseful expression, lifts his arms, forming the shape of a cross with his body, and says "I knew them all!" He then points to the sky and shows Marcelo the <a href="/wiki/Four_Horsemen_of_the_Apocalypse" title="Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse">Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse</a> riding away into the clouds.

When Huntingdon receives a message from Lady Marian Fitzwalter, his love interest, telling him of all that has transpired, he requests permission to return to England.

</p><p>In the United States in 1917, James "Jim" Apperson's (<a href="/wiki/John_Gilbert_(actor)" title="John Gilbert (actor)">John Gilbert</a>) idleness (in contrast to his hardworking brother) incurs the great displeasure of his wealthy businessman father. Then America enters World War I. Jim informs his worried mother that he has no intention of enlisting, and his father threatens to kick him out of the house if he does not join.  However, when he runs into his patriotic friends at a send-off parade, he is persuaded to enlist, making his father very proud.
</p><p>During training, Jim makes friendships with Southern construction worker Slim (<a href="/wiki/Karl_Dane" title="Karl Dane">Karl Dane</a>) and Bronx bartender Bull (Tom O'Brien). Their unit ships out to France, where they are billeted at a farm in the village of <a href="/wiki/Champillon" title="Champillon">Champillon</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Marne_(department)" title="Marne (department)">Marne</a>.

She repulses all their advances, but gradually warms to Jim, bonding at first over <a href="/wiki/Chewing_gum" title="Chewing gum">chewing gum</a>. They eventually fall in love, despite not being able to speak <a href="/wiki/French_language" title="French language">each other's language</a>. One day, however, Jim receives a letter and a photograph from Justyn (<a href="/wiki/Claire_Adams" title="Claire Adams">Claire Adams</a>), which reveals that they are engaged. When Melisande sees the picture, she realizes the situation and runs off in tears. Before Jim can decide what to do, his unit is ordered to the front. Melisande hears the commotion and races back, just in time for the lovers to embrace and kiss.
</p><p>The Americans march towards the front and are <a href="/wiki/Strafing" title="Strafing">strafed</a> by an <a href="/wiki/Attack_aircraft#World_War_I_and_II" title="Attack aircraft">enemy fighter</a> before it is <a href="/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare#First_World_War" title="Anti-aircraft warfare">shot down</a>. The unit is sent to the attack immediately, advancing against snipers and machine guns in the woods, then more machine guns, artillery, and poison gas in the open. They settle down in a makeshift line. Jim shelters in a shellhole with Slim and Bull.
</p><p>That night, orders come down for one man to go out and eliminate a troublesome mortar crew; Slim wins a spitting contest for the opportunity. He succeeds, but is spotted and wounded on the way back. After listening to Slim's pleas for help, Jim cannot stand it any longer and goes to his rescue against orders. Bull follows, but is shot and killed. By the time Jim reaches Slim, he is already dead. Jim is then shot in the leg. When a German (<a href="/wiki/George_Beranger" title="George Beranger">George Beranger</a>) comes to finish him off, Jim shoots and wounds him. The German starts crawling back to his line. Jim catches up to him in another shellhole, but, face to face, cannot bring himself to finish him off with his bayonet. Instead, he gives his erstwhile enemy a cigarette. Soon after, the German dies. However, Jim is not stuck in <a href="/wiki/No_man%27s_land" title="No man's land">no man's land</a> for long; the Americans attack, and he is taken away to a hospital.
</p><p>From another patient, he learns that Champillon has changed hands four times. Worried about Melisande, Jim sneaks out of the hospital and hitches a ride. When he gets to the farmhouse, he finds it damaged and empty. Melisande and her mother have joined a stream of refugees. Jim collapses and is carried off in an ambulance by retreating soldiers.
</p><p>After the war ends, Jim goes home to America. Before he arrives, his mother overhears Justyn and Jim's brother Harry (Robert Ober) discussing what to do; in Jim's absence, they have fallen in love. When Jim appears, it is revealed that he has had his leg amputated. Later, Jim tells his mother about Melisande; she tells him to go back and find her. When he returns to the farm, Melisande rushes into his arms.

Brother Paul, who was talking to another person about his dream to build a mission, assumes he wants to pay for the mission and tells him $1000. Though he finds that a rather hefty amount for a mere pushcart, Manners pays without complaint.
</p><p>Once Manners reads in the newspaper that he is sponsoring a mission, he goes there to dissociate himself from it. He is aghast to find it named the J. Harold Manners Mission. When he starts to tear down the sign, he is scolded by Brother Paul's pretty daughter, Hope (<a href="/wiki/Jobyna_Ralston" title="Jobyna Ralston">Jobyna Ralston</a>), who does not know who he is. Far from being offended, he is smitten with her. Thus, when Brother Paul returns and invites him inside to tour the place, he readily accepts. Hope, once she learns his identity, apologizes.
</p><p>In order to build up attendance, Manners runs through town provoking people, and winds up with a crowd chasing him right into the mission. Some of the men are in possession of the proceeds of a jewel robbery. Before they can beat him up, however, the police arrive. The quick-witted Manners takes up a "collection"; the crooks deposit their loot in the hat he is using while the police search everybody. This act earns him the friendship of the gang.

As they drive away, one of them tells the wedding's "reception committee" that Manners is not going to marry Hope. The disappointed committeemen get drunk. Then their leader decides to go to Manner's club to confirm the news. They free Manners and head back to the mission. Manners has his hands full shepherding five drunks, but finally gets them all there and marries Hope.

</p><p>Eddie Kearns (<a href="/wiki/Charles_King_(musical_actor)" title="Charles King (musical actor)">Charles King</a>) sings "The Broadway Melody", and tells some chorus girls that he brought the Mahoney Sisters <a href="/wiki/Vaudeville" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</a> act to New York to perform it with him in the latest revue being produced by Francis Zanfield (<a href="/wiki/Eddie_Kane" title="Eddie Kane">Eddie Kane</a>). Harriet "Hank" Mahoney (<a href="/wiki/Bessie_Love" title="Bessie Love">Bessie Love</a>) and her sister Queenie Mahoney (<a href="/wiki/Anita_Page" title="Anita Page">Anita Page</a>) are awaiting Eddie's arrival at their apartment. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent, while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to become a star. Hank declines the offer of their Uncle Jed (<a href="/wiki/Jed_Prouty" title="Jed Prouty">Jed Prouty</a>) to join a 30-week traveling show but consents to think it over.
</p><p>Eddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to a rehearsal for Zanfield's revue to present their act. A blond woman sabotages their performance by placing a bag in the piano, which causes a fight with Hank. Zanfield isn't interested in it, but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well, saying both will work for one wage. She also convinces him to pretend that Hank's business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During a dress rehearsal for the revue, Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for "The Broadway Melody" and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number. Meanwhile, another woman is injured after falling off a set prop and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is captivated by Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques "Jock" Warriner (<a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Thomson_(actor)" title="Kenneth Thomson (actor)">Kenneth Thomson</a>). While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent.
</p><p>Over the following weeks, Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and the deterioration of the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight her growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she's setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other, but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister's heart, runs off to Jock once again.
</p><p>Hank, after witnessing Queenie's fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, finally realizes that they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. She claims to never have loved him and that she'd only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves, she breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show.
</p><p>There's a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie, but he insists that they spend time alone. When she resists his advances, he says that it's the least that she could do after all he's done for her. He begins to get physical, but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind.
</p><p>Sometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the return of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend, but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she's through with show business and will settle down in their new house on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Long_Island,_New_York" title="Long Island, New York">Long Island</a>. She insists that Hank live with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments the fact that she wasn't able to help her sister find the happiness she deserves. Ironically, Hank's new partner is the blond who tried to sabotage the act when the sisters first arrived in New York. The final scene shows Hank on her way to the train station. She promises her new partner that they'll be back on Broadway within six months.

Later in the film, a lavish pre-Code dance sequence for the song "Turn on the Heat", including scantily clad and gyrating island women enticing bananas on trees to abruptly grow and stiffen, with the graphic metaphor lost on no one, occurs without Gaynor's participation.
</p><p>Professor Kantorek gives an impassioned speech about the glory of serving in the <a href="/wiki/German_Army_(German_Empire)" title="German Army (German Empire)">Army</a> and "saving the Fatherland". On the brink of becoming men, the boys in his class, led by Paul Baumer, are moved to join the army as the new 2nd Company.  Their romantic delusions are quickly broken during their brief but rigorous training under the abusive Corporal Himmelstoss, who bluntly informs them, "You're going to be soldiers—and that's <i>all</i>."
</p><p>The new soldiers arrive by train at the combat zone, which is mayhem, with soldiers everywhere, incoming shells, horse-drawn wagons racing about, and prolonged rain. One in the group is killed before the new recruits can reach their post, to the alarm of one of the new soldiers (Behn). The new soldiers are assigned to a unit composed of older soldiers, who are not exactly accommodating. The young soldiers find that there is no food available at the moment. They have not eaten since breakfast, but the men they have joined have not had food for two days. One of them, "Kat" Katczinsky, had gone to locate something to eat and he returns with a slaughtered hog he has stolen from a field kitchen. The young soldiers "pay" for their dinner with soaps and cigarettes.
</p><p>The new recruits' first trip to the trenches with the veterans, to re-string barbed wire, is a harrowing experience, especially when Behn is blinded by shrapnel and hysterically runs into machine-gun fire. After spending several days in a bunker under bombardment, they at last move into the trenches and successfully repulse an enemy attack; they then counterattack and take an enemy trench with heavy casualties, but have to abandon it. They are sent back to the field kitchens to get their rations; each man receives double helpings, simply because of the number of dead.
</p><p>The men start out eating greedily, but then settle into a satiated <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/torpor" title="wikt:torpor">torpor</a>. They hear that they are to return to the front the next day and begin a semi-serious discussion about the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Origins_of_World_War_I" title="Origins of World War I">causes of the war</a> and of wars in general. They speculate about whether geographical entities offend each other and whether these disagreements involve them. Tjaden speaks familiarly about himself and the <a href="/wiki/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor" title="Wilhelm II, German Emperor">Kaiser</a>; Kat jokes that instead of having a war, they should have the leaders of Europe be stripped to their underwear and "fight it out with clubs".
</p><p>One day, Corporal Himmelstoss arrives to the front and is immediately spurned because of his bad reputation; he is forced to go over the top with the 2nd Company and is promptly killed. In an attack on a cemetery, Paul stabs a French soldier, but finds himself trapped in a hole with the dying man for an entire night. Throughout the night, he desperately tries to help him, bringing him water, but fails miserably to stop him from dying. He cries bitterly and begs the dead body to speak so he can be forgiven. Later, he returns to the German lines and is comforted by Kat.
</p><p>Going back to the front line, Paul is severely wounded and taken to a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catholic" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> hospital, along with his good friend Albert Kropp. Kropp's leg is amputated, but he does not find out until some time afterwards. Around this time, Paul is taken to the bandaging ward, from which, according to its reputation, nobody has ever returned alive; but he later returns to the normal rooms triumphantly, only to find Kropp in depression.
</p><p>Paul is given a furlough and visits his family at home.  He is shocked by how uninformed everyone is about the actual situation of the war; everyone is convinced that a final "push for Paris" is soon to occur.  When Paul visits the schoolroom where he was originally recruited, he finds Professor Kantorek prattling the same patriotic fervor to a class of even younger students.  Professor Kantorek asks of Paul to detail his experience, to which the latter reveals that war was not at all like he had envisioned and mentions the deaths of his partners; this revelation upsets the professor, as well as the young students who promptly call Paul a "coward". Disillusioned and angry, Paul returns to the front and comes upon another 2nd company that is filled with new young recruits who are now disillusioned; he is then happily greeted by Tjaden.  He goes to find Kat, and they discuss the inability of the people to comprehend the futility of the war.  Kat's shin is broken when a bomb dropped by an aircraft falls nearby, so Paul carries him back to a field hospital - only to find that Kat has been killed by a second explosion.  Crushed by the loss of his mentor, Paul leaves.
</p><p>In the final scene, Paul is back on the front lines. He sees a butterfly just beyond his trench. Paul smiles and reaches out towards the butterfly, but becoming too exposed, he is shot and killed by an enemy sniper.  The final shot shows the 2nd Company arriving at the front for the first time, fading out to the image of a cemetery.

Waldman tells them that Frankenstein has been working on creating life. Elizabeth, intent on rescuing Frankenstein, arrives just as Henry is making his final tests. He tells them to watch, claiming to have discovered the ray that brought life into the world. They watch Frankenstein and the hunchback as they raise the dead creature on an operating table, high into the room, toward an opening at the top of the laboratory. Then a terrific crash of thunder booms, and Frankenstein's electric machines flash, crackle and buzz. Shortly, the hand of Frankenstein's creature begins to move. This prompts Frankenstein to shout 'It's alive!'.
</p><p>The manufactured creature, despite its grotesque form, initially appears to be a simple, innocent creation. Frankenstein welcomes it into his laboratory and asks his creation to sit, which it does. He then opens up the roof, causing the creature to reach out towards the sunlight. Fritz enters with a flaming torch, which frightens the creature. Its fright is mistaken by Frankenstein and Waldman as an attempt to attack them, and it is chained in the dungeon. Thinking that it is not fit for society and will wreak havoc at any chance, they leave the creature locked up, where Fritz antagonizes it with a torch. As Henry and Waldman consider the creature's fate, they hear a shriek from the dungeon. Frankenstein and Waldman run down and find that the creature has strangled Fritz. The creature lunges at the two but they escape, locking the creature inside. Realizing that the creature must be destroyed, Henry prepares an injection of a powerful drug and the two conspire to release the creature and inject it as it attacks. When the door is unlocked the creature lunges at Frankenstein as Waldman injects the drug into the creature's back. The creature falls to the floor unconscious.
</p><p>Henry collapses from exhaustion, and Elizabeth and Henry's father arrive and take him home. Henry is worried about the creature but Waldman reassures him that he will destroy it. Later, Henry is at home, recovered and preparing for his wedding while Waldman examines the creature. As he is preparing to vivisect it, the creature awakens and strangles him. It escapes from the tower and wanders through the landscape. It has a short encounter with a farmer's young daughter, Maria. She is not afraid of him and asks him to play a game with her in which they toss flowers into a lake and watch them float. The creature enjoys the game, but when they run out of flowers he thinks Maria will float as well, so he throws her into the lake where, to his puzzlement, she drowns. Upset by this outcome, the creature runs away.
</p><p>With preparations for the wedding completed, Henry is serenely happy with Elizabeth. They are to marry as soon as Waldman arrives. However, Victor rushes in, saying that Doctor Waldman has been found strangled. Henry suspects the creature. Meanwhile, the creature enters Elizabeth's room, causing her to scream. When the searchers arrive, they find Elizabeth unconscious on the bed. The creature has escaped.
</p><p>Maria's father arrives, carrying his daughter's body. He says she was murdered, and the villagers form a search party to capture the creature, and bring it to justice (dead or alive). In order to search the whole country for the creature, they split into three groups: Ludwig leads the first group into the woods, Henry leads the second group into the mountains, and the Bürgermaster leads the third group by the lake. During the search, Henry becomes separated from the group and is discovered by the creature, who attacks him. The creature knocks Henry unconscious and carries him off to an old mill. The peasants hear his cries and they regroup to follow. They find the creature has climbed to the top, dragging Henry with him. The creature hurls the scientist to the ground. His fall is broken by the vanes of the windmill, saving his life. Some of the villagers hurry him to his home while the rest of the mob set the windmill ablaze, killing the entrapped creature inside.
</p><p>At Castle Frankenstein, Frankenstein's father, Baron Frankenstein, celebrates the wedding of his recovered son with a toast to a future grandchild.
</p><p>Citizens and dignitaries are assembled for the unveiling of a new monument to "Peace and Prosperity". After droning speeches the veil is lifted to reveal the Little Tramp asleep in the lap of one of the sculpted figures. After several minutes of slapstick he manages to escape the assembly's wrath to perambulate the city. He rebukes two newsboys who taunt him for his shabbiness, and while coyly admiring a nude statue has a near-fatal encounter with a sidewalk elevator.
</p><p>The Tramp encounters the beautiful flower girl on a street-corner and in the course of buying a flower realizes she is blind; he is instantly smitten. Through an aural coincidence the girl mistakes her customer for the wealthy owner of a chauffeured automobile.
</p><p>That evening the Tramp saves a drunken millionaire from suicide. The millionaire takes his new best friend back to his mansion for champagne, then (after another abortive suicide attempt) out for a night on the town. After helping the millionaire home the next morning, he sees the flower girl en route to her street-corner. The Tramp gets some money from the millionaire and catches up to the girl; he buys all her flowers and drives her home in the millionaire's car.
</p><p>After the Tramp leaves, the flower girl tells her grandmother (<a href="/wiki/Florence_Lee_(born_1864)" title="Florence Lee (born 1864)">Florence Lee</a>) about her kind and wealthy friend. Meanwhile, the Tramp returns to the mansion, where the millionaire – now sober – does not remember him and has him thrown out. Later that day, the millionaire is once more intoxicated and, seeing the Tramp on the street, invites him home for a lavish party. But the next morning history repeats itself: the millionaire is again sober and the Tramp is again out on his ear.
</p><p>Finding that the girl is not at her usual street-corner, the Tramp goes to her apartment, where he overhears a doctor tell the grandmother that the girl is very ill: "She has a fever and needs careful attention."
Determined to help, the Tramp takes a job as a <a href="/wiki/Street_sweeper" title="Street sweeper">street sweeper</a>.
</p><p>On his lunch break he brings the girl groceries while her grandmother is out selling flowers. To entertain her he reads a newspaper aloud; in it is a story about a Viennese doctor's blindness cure.
"Wonderful, then I'll be able to see you," says the girl – and the Tramp is struck by what may happen should she gain her sight and discover that he is not the wealthy man she imagines.
He also finds an eviction notice the girl's grandmother has hidden. As he leaves, he promises the girl that he will pay the rent.
</p><p>The Tramp returns to work to find himself fired – he has been late once too often.
A boxer convinces him to fight in a fake bout; they will "go easy" on each other and split the prize money. After the boxer flees after learning he is about to be arrested, he is replaced by a no-nonsense fighter who knocks the Tramp out despite the Tramp's creative and nimble efforts to keep out of reach.
</p><p>The Tramp encounters the drunken millionaire a third time and is again invited to the mansion. The Tramp relates the girl's plight and the millionaire gives him money for her operation. Two burglars knock the millionaire out and flee with the rest of his money. The police find the Tramp with the money given him by the millionaire, who because of the knock on the head does not remember giving it. The Tramp evades the police long enough to get the money to the girl, telling her he will be going away for a time, but in due course he is apprehended and imprisoned.
</p><p>Months later the Tramp is released. He goes to the girl's customary street corner but she is not there. We learn that the girl – her sight restored – now runs a busy flower shop with her grandmother. But she has not forgotten her mysterious benefactor, whom she imagines to be rich and handsome: when an elegant man enters the shop she wonders for a moment if "he" has returned.
</p><p>The Tramp happens by the shop, where the girl is arranging flowers in the window. He stoops to retrieve a flower discarded in the gutter. After a brief skirmish with his old nemeses, the newsboys, he turns to the shop's window though which he suddenly sees the girl, who has been watching him without (of course) knowing who he is. At the sight of her he is frozen for a few seconds, then breaks into a broad smile. The girl is flattered and giggles to her employee: "I've made a conquest!" Via pantomime through the glass, she kindly offers him a fresh flower (to replace the crushed one he took from the gutter) and a coin.
</p><p>Suddenly embarrassed, the Tramp starts to shuffle away, but the girl steps to the shop door and again offers the flower, which he shyly accepts. She takes his hand and presses the coin into it, but abruptly she stops; her smile turns to a look of puzzlement. She runs her fingers along his arm, his shoulder, his lapels, then catches her breath: "You?" The Tramp nods with an uncertain smile and asks, "You can see now?" The girl replies, "Yes, I can see now" and tearfully pulls his hand to her bosom. The uncertainty on the Tramp's face turns to joy as the film fades to black.

The crew boards the <i>Venture</i> and sets off, during which the ship's first mate <a href="/wiki/Jack_Driscoll" title="Jack Driscoll">Jack Driscoll</a>, falls in love with Ann.
</p><p>Denham reveals to the crew that their destination is in fact <a href="/wiki/Skull_Island" title="Skull Island">Skull Island</a>, an uncharted territory. He alludes to a monstrous creature named <i>Kong</i>, rumored to dwell on the island. The crew arrives and anchor offshore. They encounter a native village, separated from the rest of the island by an ancient stone wall. They witness a group of natives preparing to sacrifice a young woman termed the "bride of Kong". The intruders are spotted and the native chief stops the ceremony. When he sees Ann, he offers to trade six of his tribal women for the "golden woman". They rebuff him and return to the <i>Venture</i>.
</p><p>That night, natives kidnap Ann from the ship and take her to their altar, where she is offered to Kong, an enormous <a href="/wiki/Gorilla" title="Gorilla">gorilla</a>-like creature. Kong carries Ann into the wilderness as Denham, Driscoll and some volunteers enter the jungle in hopes of rescuing her. They are ambushed by another giant creature, a <i><a href="/wiki/Stegosaurus" title="Stegosaurus">Stegosaurus</a></i>, which they manage to defeat. After facing a <i><a href="/wiki/Brontosaurus" title="Brontosaurus">Brontosaurus</a></i> and Kong himself, Driscoll and Denham are the only survivors.
</p><p>A <i><a href="/wiki/Tyrannosaurus" title="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a></i> attacks Ann and Kong, but he kills it in the battle.

While Kong is distracted killing a <i><a href="/wiki/Pteranodon" title="Pteranodon">Pteranodon</a></i> that tried to fly away with Ann, Driscoll reaches her and they climb down a vine dangling from a cliff ledge. When Kong notices and starts pulling them back up, the two fall unharmed. They run through the jungle and back to the village, where Denham, Englehorn, and the surviving crewmen are waiting. Kong, following, breaks open the gate and relentlessly rampages through the village. Onshore, Denham, now determined to bring Kong back alive, knocks him unconscious with a <a href="/wiki/Chemical_warfare" title="Chemical warfare">gas bomb</a>.
</p><p>Shackled in chains, Kong is taken to New York City and presented to a <a href="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway theatre</a> audience as "Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World". Ann and Jack are brought on stage to join him, surrounded by a group of press photographers. Kong, believing that the ensuing flash photography is an attack, breaks loose. The audience flees in horror. Ann is whisked away to a hotel room on a high floor, but Kong, scaling the building, soon finds her. His hand smashes through the hotel room window, immobilizing Jack, and abducts Ann again. Kong rampages through the city.

The customer threatens to call the cops, so Slick whacks him over the head with a bottle. Mistakenly thinking he has killed the man, Slick flees, but is caught and jailed.
</p><p>Fearing that Slick will implicate her, Tira asks Big Bill for a loan to retain her lawyer, Bennie Pinkowitz (<a href="/wiki/Gregory_Ratoff" title="Gregory Ratoff">Gregory Ratoff</a>). He agrees on condition that she does her <a href="/wiki/Lion_taming" title="Lion taming">lion taming</a> act, which includes putting her head into the mouth of one of the beasts, promising her that it will get her (and him) to the "Big Show".

Unwilling to lose his prize act, he has Slick, recently released from prison, sneak into Tira's penthouse suite, where Jack finds him in his robe. As a result, Jack breaks off the engagement. Tira sues Jack for breach of promise. The defense tries to use her past relationships to discredit her, but the judge allows her to cross examine the witnesses herself and in doing so she wins over not only the judge and jury, but also Jack. Jack agrees to give her a big settlement check. When he goes to see her, Tira tears up the check, and the two reconcile.
</p><p>On the last day of 1899, Jane and Robert Marryot, an upper-class couple, return to their townhouse in a fashionable area of London before midnight, so they can keep their tradition of celebrating the new year with a midnight toast. Although Jane and Robert have been married for some years and have two young sons, Edward and Joey, they are still very much in love. Jane worries because Robert has joined the <a href="/wiki/City_of_London_Imperial_Volunteers" title="City of London Imperial Volunteers">City of London Imperial Volunteers</a> (CIV) as an officer, and will soon be leaving to serve in the <a href="/wiki/Second_Boer_War" title="Second Boer War">Second Boer War</a>, where Jane's brother is already fighting in the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Mafeking" title="Siege of Mafeking">Siege of Mafeking</a>. Downstairs, the Marryots' butler Alfred Bridges mixes punch for their toast, while Cook dons her finest outfit to attend the public outdoor celebrations. Alfred has joined the CIV as a private and is also leaving soon. His wife Ellen, the Marryots' maid, worries about what will become of her and their new baby Fanny if Alfred is killed or seriously injured, but he is confident despite the pessimistic predictions of Ellen's elderly mother, Mrs. Snapper. At midnight, the Marryot and Bridges families ring in the new century while Cook dances with other revelers in the street.
</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Jane bids an emotional farewell to Robert at the dock when he boards the troop ship bound for Africa, while Ellen tearfully sees off Alfred, who is leaving on the same ship. While Robert is away, Jane's friend Margaret Harris keeps her company and gives her emotional support. Margaret's young daughter Edith plays Boer War games with Edward and Joey Marryot using toy soldiers and cannons, which distresses Jane. While Jane and Margaret are attending a comic <a href="/wiki/Operetta" title="Operetta">operetta</a> at the theatre to take Jane's mind off the war, the relief of Mafeking is announced from the stage, and the audience cheers. Robert and Alfred soon return home unharmed, to the delight of their families, and Robert is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Knighthood" title="Knighthood">knighted</a> for his service.
</p><p>Upon his arrival, Alfred announces to his wife and mother-in-law that he has bought his own pub with money partly provided by Robert, and he and Ellen will be leaving service and moving to a flat, along with Fanny and Mrs. Snapper. As the downstairs staff have a cup of tea to celebrate Alfred's return, they receive news of the <a href="/wiki/Queen_Victoria#Death_and_succession" title="Queen Victoria">death</a> of <a href="/wiki/Queen_Victoria" title="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>. Robert rides in the beginning part of her <a href="/wiki/Funeral_procession" title="Funeral procession">funeral procession</a> and the family and staff watch it from their upstairs windows.
</p><p>A few years later, in 1908, Alfred has developed <a href="/wiki/Alcoholism" title="Alcoholism">a drinking problem</a> and is managing the pub poorly and getting behind on the family's rent due to spending the rent money on drink. Ellen and Fanny, now a schoolgirl, are embarrassed and put off by Alfred's drinking and slovenly appearance. Ellen carefully plans a genteel social evening when Jane Marryot and her son Edward, who is now in college at <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a>, pay a visit to the Bridges' flat. Ellen does not tell Alfred about the visit and lies to the Marryots that he can't attend due to a leg injury, but just as the Marryots are leaving, Alfred shows up drunk, acts rudely and destroys a doll that Jane had given Fanny, causing Fanny to run away into the street, where she distracts herself by dancing with some <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pearlies" title="Pearlies">Pearlies</a>. An angry Alfred chases Fanny, attacks the Pearlies, and then stumbles into the street where he is fatally run over by a <a href="/wiki/Horse-drawn_vehicle" title="Horse-drawn vehicle">horse-drawn</a> <a href="/wiki/Fire_engine" title="Fire engine">fire engine</a>.
</p><p>The following year, on July 25, 1909, Ellen and Fanny Bridges encounter the Marryot family again at the seaside, where Ellen explains that she and Fanny are living off the proceeds from the pub, now owned by Ellen. Fanny has become a talented dancer and singer. Edward Marryot has fallen in love with his childhood playmate Edith Harris. The family witnesses the <a href="/wiki/Louis_Bl%C3%A9riot#1909_Channel_crossing" title="Louis Blériot">historic flight</a> by <a href="/wiki/Louis_Bl%C3%A9riot" title="Louis Blériot">Louis Blériot</a> over the <a href="/wiki/English_Channel" title="English Channel">English Channel</a>.
</p><p>Three years later, by April 1912, Edward and Edith have married and are spending their honeymoon on a luxurious <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Four_funnel_liner" title="Four funnel liner">four funneled ocean liner</a>, which is dramatically revealed by a camera shot on a <a href="/wiki/Personal_flotation_device" title="Personal flotation device">life preserver</a> on board to be the ill-fated <i> <a href="/wiki/RMS_Titanic" title="RMS Titanic">RMS Titanic</a></i>. Later scenes make it clear that Edward and Edith both perished in the <a href="/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic" title="Sinking of the RMS Titanic">sinking</a>, although the sinking itself, their deaths, and their families' initial reaction to it are not shown, it is only briefly mentioned in later dialogue.
</p><p>Two years later, in 1914, <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> breaks out. Robert and Joe Marryot both serve as officers, thinking the war will be over within a few months. While on leave, Joe happens upon Fanny Bridges, whom he remembers from their childhood, performing as a featured singer and dancer in a nightclub. He re-introduces himself to her, and they bond while witnessing a <a href="/wiki/German_strategic_bombing_during_World_War_I" title="German strategic bombing during World War I">Zeppelin air raid</a> on London from the rooftop. She later becomes the star of a theatrical production. Fanny and Joe fall in love and Joe, who miraculously manages to survive the next four years of the war despite all his fellow officers being killed in action, spends most of his leave time with her, unbeknownst to his parents. He finally proposes, but she hesitates to say yes due to the difference in their <a href="/wiki/Social_class" title="Social class">social classes</a>, although she does love him. Just after <a href="/wiki/Armistice_of_11_November_1918" title="Armistice of 11 November 1918">armistice</a> is announced in 1918, Ellen, who has found out about Fanny and Joe's love affair, goes to see Jane, reveals the affair to her, and demands that Joe marry Fanny when he returns. While a surprised and upset Jane is arguing with Ellen, Jane receives a telegram informing her that Joe has been killed in battle. Later, a grief-stricken Jane walks sadly through armistice celebrations in <a href="/wiki/Trafalgar_Square" title="Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square</a>.
</p><p>Following the war, a montage shows daily life becoming even more chaotic and the social order being further disrupted, while some advocate that mankind work towards peace. The film ends on New Year's Day 1933, with Jane and Robert, now elderly, carrying on their tradition of celebrating the new year with a midnight toast to their past memories, as well as to the future.
</p><p>The story is set in New York City in the <a href="/wiki/Gay_Nineties" title="Gay Nineties">1890s</a>. A bawdy singer, Lady Lou (<a href="/wiki/Mae_West" title="Mae West">Mae West</a>), works in the <a href="/wiki/Bowery" title="Bowery">Bowery</a> barroom saloon of her boss and benefactor, Gus Jordan (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Noah_Beery" title="Noah Beery">Noah Beery</a>), who has given her many diamonds. But Lou is a lady with more men friends than anyone might imagine.
</p><p>What she does not know is that Gus trafficks in prostitution and runs a counterfeiting ring to help finance her expensive diamonds. He also sends young women to <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> to be pickpockets. Gus works with two other crooked entertainer-assistants, Russian Rita (<a href="/wiki/Rafaela_Ottiano" title="Rafaela Ottiano">Rafaela Ottiano</a>) and Rita's lover, the suave Sergei Stanieff (<a href="/wiki/Gilbert_Roland" title="Gilbert Roland">Gilbert Roland</a>). One of Gus's rivals and former "friend" of Lou's, named Dan Flynn (<a href="/wiki/David_Landau_(actor)" title="David Landau (actor)">David Landau</a>), spends most of the movie dropping hints to Lou that Gus is up to no good, promising to look after her once Gus is in jail. Lou leads him on, hinting at times that she will return to him, but eventually he loses patience and implies he'll see her jailed if she doesn't submit to him.
</p><p>A city mission is located next door to the bar. Its young director, Captain Cummings (<a href="/wiki/Cary_Grant" title="Cary Grant">Cary Grant</a>), is in reality an undercover <a href="/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="Federal government of the United States">Federal</a> agent working to infiltrate and expose the illegal activities in the bar. Gus suspects nothing; he worries only that Cummings will reform his bar and scare away his customers.
</p><p>Lou's former boyfriend, Chick Clark (<a href="/wiki/Owen_Moore" title="Owen Moore">Owen Moore</a>), is a vicious criminal who was convicted of robbery and sent to prison for trying to steal diamonds for her. In his absence, she becomes attracted to the handsome young psalm-singing reformer.
</p><p>Warned that Chick thinks she's betrayed him, she goes to the prison to try to reassure him. All the inmates greet her warmly and familiarly  as she walks down the cellblock. Chick becomes angry and threatens to kill her if she double-crosses or two-times him before he gets out. She lies and claims she has been true to him. Gus gives counterfeit money to Rita and Sergei to spend. Chick escapes from jail, and police search for him in the bar. He comes into Lou's room and starts to strangle her, breaking off only because he still loves her and cannot harm her. Lou calms him down by promising that she will go with him when she finishes her next number.
</p><p>After Sergei gives Lou a diamond pin belonging to Rita, Rita starts a fight with Lou, who accidentally stabs her to death. Lou calmly combs the dead woman's long hair to hide the fact Rita is dead while the police search the room for Chick Clark. She has her bodyguard Spider (<a href="/wiki/Dewey_Robinson" title="Dewey Robinson">Dewey Robinson</a>), who "would do anything for you, Lou" dispose of Rita's body. She then tells Spider to bring Chick, who's hiding in an alley, back to her room upstairs. Then, while she sings "<a href="/wiki/Frankie_and_Johnny_(song)" title="Frankie and Johnny (song)">Frankie and Johnny</a>", she silently signals to Dan Flynn that he should go to her room to wait for her, even though she knows Chick is in there with a gun. Chick shoots Dan dead and the gunfire draws a police raid. Cummings shows his badge and reveals himself as "The Hawk", a well-known Federal agent, as he arrests Gus and Sergei. Chick, still lurking in Lou's room, is about to kill Lou for double-crossing him, when Cummings also apprehends him.
</p><p>Cummings then takes Lou away in an open horse-drawn carriage instead of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paddywagon" title="Paddywagon">paddywagon</a> into which all the other criminals have been loaded. He tells her she doesn't belong in jail and removes all her other rings and slips a diamond engagement ring onto her left ring finger.
</p><p>Playboy Captain Danilo (<a href="/wiki/Maurice_Chevalier" title="Maurice Chevalier">Maurice Chevalier</a>) is ordered by King Achmet of Marshovia (<a href="/wiki/George_Barbier_(actor)" title="George Barbier (actor)">George Barbier</a>) to court and marry Madame Sonia (<a href="/wiki/Jeanette_MacDonald" title="Jeanette MacDonald">Jeanette MacDonald</a>), a rich widow who owns a large portion of the kingdom.
</p><p>Spoiled heiress Ellen "Ellie" Andrews has eloped with pilot and fortune-hunter King Westley against the wishes of her extremely wealthy father, Alexander Andrews. Andrews wants to have the marriage annulled because he knows Westley is really only interested in her money. Jumping ship in Florida, she runs away and boards a <a href="/wiki/Greyhound_Lines" title="Greyhound Lines">Greyhound bus</a> to New York City to reunite with her husband. She meets fellow bus passenger Peter Warne, a freshly out-of-work newspaper reporter. Soon Peter recognizes her and gives her a choice: If she will give him an exclusive on her story, he will help her reunite with Westley. If not, he will tell her father where she is. Ellie agrees to the first choice.
</p><p>As they go through several adventures together, Ellie loses her initial disdain for him and begins to fall in love. When they have to <a href="/wiki/Hitchhiking" title="Hitchhiking">hitchhike</a>, they fail to secure a ride until Ellie displays a shapely leg to Danker, the next driver. When they stop <i>en route</i>, Danker tries to steal their luggage but Peter chases him down and seizes his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Model_T" title="Model T">Model T</a>. Nearing the end of their journey, Ellie confesses her love to Peter. When the owners of the motel in which they are staying notice that Peter's car is gone, they expel Ellie. Believing Peter has deserted her, Ellie telephones her father, who agrees to let her marry Westley. Meanwhile, Peter has obtained money from his editor to marry Ellie, but he misses her on the road. Although Ellie has no desire to be with Westley, she believes Peter has betrayed her for the reward money and agrees to have a second, formal wedding (with Westley).
</p><p>On the wedding day, she finally reveals the whole story to her father. When Peter comes to Ellie's home, Andrews offers him the reward money, but Peter insists on being paid only his expenses: a paltry $39.60 for items he had had to sell to buy gasoline. When Ellie's father presses him for an explanation of his odd behavior and demands to know if he loves her, Peter first tries to dodge the questions, but then admits he loves Ellie and storms out. Westley arrives for his wedding via <a href="/wiki/Autogyro" title="Autogyro">autogyro</a>; but at the ceremony, Andrews reveals to his daughter Peter's refusal of the reward money, and tells her that her car is waiting by the back gate in case she changes her mind about going through with the wedding. Ellie dumps Westley at the altar and bolts for her car, driving away as the newsreel cameras crank.
</p><p>A few days later, Andrews is working at his desk when Westley calls to tell him he is taking the financial settlement he was offered and won't contest the annulment. His executive assistant brings him a telegram from Peter, which says, "What's holding up the annulment, you slowpoke? The walls of Jericho are toppling!", referring to a makeshift wall made of a blanket over a wire tied across the rooms they slept in between them to give them privacy. With the annulment in hand, Andrews sends the reply, "Let 'em topple."
</p><p>In the last scene, we see Peter's battered Model T parked in a motor court in Glen Falls, Michigan. The mom and pop owners of the motor court talk, wondering why on such a warm night the newlyweds – he had seen the marriage license – wanted a clothesline, an extra blanket, and the little tin trumpet he had gotten for them. As they look at the cabin, the toy trumpet sounds a fanfare, the blanket falls to the floor, and the lights in the cabin go out.
</p><p>One night in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Portsmouth,_England" title="Portsmouth, England">Portsmouth, England</a> in 1787, a <a href="/wiki/Impressment" title="Impressment">press gang</a> breaks into a local tavern and presses all of the men drinking there into naval service.  One of the men inquires as to what ship they will sail on, and the press gang leader informs him that it is <a href="/wiki/HMS_Bounty" title="HMS Bounty">HMS <i>Bounty</i></a>. Upon inquiring as to who the captain is, another of the men is told the captain is <a href="/wiki/William_Bligh" title="William Bligh">William Bligh</a> (<a href="/wiki/Charles_Laughton" title="Charles Laughton">Charles Laughton</a>) and attempts to escape, as Bligh is a brutal tyrant who routinely administers harsh punishment to officers and crew alike who lack discipline, cause any infraction on board the ship, or in any manner defy his authority. The <i>Bounty</i> leaves England several days later on a two-year voyage over the Pacific Ocean. <a href="/wiki/Fletcher_Christian" title="Fletcher Christian">Fletcher Christian</a> (<a href="/wiki/Clark_Gable" title="Clark Gable">Clark Gable</a>), the ship's lieutenant, is a formidable yet compassionate man who disapproves of Bligh's treatment of the crew. Roger Byam (<a href="/wiki/Franchot_Tone" title="Franchot Tone">Franchot Tone</a>) is an idealistic midshipman who is divided between his loyalty to Bligh, owing to his family's naval tradition, and his friendship with Christian.
</p><p>During the voyage, the enmity between Christian and Bligh grows after Christian openly challenges Bligh's unjust practices aboard the ship. When the ship arrives at the island of <a href="/wiki/Tahiti" title="Tahiti">Tahiti</a>, where the crew acquires breadfruit plants to take to the West Indies, as intended, Bligh punishes Christian by refusing to let him leave the ship during their stay. Byam, meanwhile, sets up residency on the island, living with the island chief, Hitihiti (William Bambridge), and his daughter, Tehani (<a href="/wiki/Movita_Castaneda" title="Movita Castaneda">Movita Castaneda</a>), and compiling an English dictionary of the Tahitian language. Hitihiti persuades Bligh to allow Christian a day pass on the island. Bligh agrees but quickly repeals the pass out of spite. Christian disregards the order and spends his one-day off the ship romancing a Tahitian girl, Maimiti (<a href="/wiki/Mamo_Clark" title="Mamo Clark">Mamo Clark</a>). Christian promises her he will be back someday.
</p><p>After leaving Tahiti the crew begins to talk of mutiny after Bligh's harsh discipline leads to the death of the ship's beloved surgeon, Mr. Bacchus (<a href="/wiki/Dudley_Digges_(actor)" title="Dudley Digges (actor)">Dudley Digges</a>), and Bligh severely cuts water rationing to the crew in favor of providing more water for the breadfruit plants. Christian, although initially opposing the idea, decides he can no longer tolerate Bligh's brutality when he witnesses crew members shackled in iron chains, and he approves the mutiny. The crew raids the weapons cabinet and seizes the ship. Bligh and his loyalists are cast into a boat and set adrift at sea with a map and rations to ensure their survival. Due to Bligh's steady leadership, they are able to find their way back to land.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Christian orders that <i>Bounty</i> return to Tahiti. Byam, who was in his cabin during the mutiny, disapproves of what Christian has done and decides the two can no longer be friends. Months later, Byam is married to Tehani and Christian has married Maimiti and has a child with her, while the rest of the crew are enjoying their freedom on the island. After a long estrangement, Byam and Christian reconcile their friendship. However, when the British ship <a href="/wiki/HMS_Pandora_(1779)" title="HMS Pandora (1779)">HMS <i>Pandora</i></a> is spotted approaching, Byam and Christian decide they must part ways. Byam and several crew members remain on the island for the ship to take them back to England, while Christian leads the remaining crew, his wife and several Tahitian men and women back on board <i>Bounty</i> in search of a new island on which to seek refuge.
</p><p>Byam boards <i>Pandora</i> and, much to his surprise, discovers that Bligh is the captain. Bligh, who suspects that Byam was complicit in the mutiny, has him imprisoned for the remainder of the journey across the sea. Back in England Byam is court-martialed and found guilty of mutiny. Before the court condemns him, Byam speaks of Bligh's cruel, dehumanising conduct aboard <i>Bounty</i>. Due to the intervention of his friend Sir Joseph Banks (<a href="/wiki/Henry_Stephenson" title="Henry Stephenson">Henry Stephenson</a>) and Lord Hood (<a href="/wiki/David_Torrence" title="David Torrence">David Torrence</a>), Byam is pardoned by <a href="/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="George III of the United Kingdom">King George III</a> and allowed to resume his naval career at sea.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Christian has found Pitcairn, an uninhabited yet sustainable island that he believes will provide adequate refuge from the reach of the Royal Navy. After <i>Bounty</i> crashes on the rocks, Christian orders her to be burned.
</p><p>The film opens with two men in boxing gloves and trunks sparring vigorously. One knocks the other squarely down, concluding their session. Changing out of their exercise gear, the latter dons a natty suit, the former a priest's collar.
</p><p>The first man is "Blackie" Norton (<a href="/wiki/Clark_Gable" title="Clark Gable">Clark Gable</a>), a saloonkeeper and gambler. He owns the <i>Paradise Club</i> on Pacific Street in the notorious <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Barbary_Coast,_San_Francisco,_California" title="Barbary Coast, San Francisco, California">Barbary Coast</a>. The other is Blackie's childhood friend, Father Tim Mullen (<a href="/wiki/Spencer_Tracy" title="Spencer Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a>), a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> priest.
</p><p>Blackie hires Mary Blake (<a href="/wiki/Jeanette_MacDonald" title="Jeanette MacDonald">Jeanette MacDonald</a>), a promising, but impoverished, classically trained singer from Benson, Colorado. She becomes a star attraction at the <i>Paradise</i>, especially for singing <a href="/wiki/Theme_from_San_Francisco" title="Theme from San Francisco">"San Francisco"</a> (a song composed for the movie, which became one of the city's official anthems).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-sfmuseum.org_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-sfmuseum.org-5">[5]</a></sup> The club piano player, "The Professor" (<a href="/wiki/Al_Shean" title="Al Shean">Al Shean</a>), can tell Mary has a professionally trained voice. Mat (<a href="/wiki/Ted_Healy" title="Ted Healy">Ted Healy</a>), Blackie's good friend at the Paradise, wisely predicts that Mary is not going to stay on the "Coast".
</p><p>Father Tim makes several attempts to reform Blackie, while the other nightclub owners urge him to run for the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Board_of_Supervisors" title="San Francisco Board of Supervisors">San Francisco Board of Supervisors</a> in order to protect their crooked interests. Encouraged by Father Tim, who believes Blackie can use the supervisor position to implement reform, Blackie decides to run for office.  Despite Father Tim's best efforts, Blackie remains a jaunty Barbary Coast atheist, although Blackie secretly paid for the new organ in Father Tim's church.
</p><p>Blackie's feelings for Mary intensify, but complications arise when she is offered an opportunity to sing in the opera.  Although she initially refuses to break her contract with Blackie, she later leaves the <i>Paradise Club</i> due to the overtly sexual manifestation of Blackie's feelings for her.
</p><p>Mary is hired by the Tivoli Opera House on Market Street. There she becomes involved with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nob_Hill" title="Nob Hill">Nob Hill</a> scion Jack Burley (<a href="/wiki/Jack_Holt_(actor)" title="Jack Holt (actor)">Jack Holt</a>). Blackie wants to stop Mary singing at the Tivoli: he arrives the night of her premiere with a process server in tow to shut down the show. However, when he hears her sing he decides not to stop the opera. After her performance, Blackie visits Mary in her dressing room. Realizing she still loves him, Mary forwardly asks him to marry her.  Blackie agrees, but their reunion is soon interrupted by Burley, who had proclaimed his love for Mary and proposed to her prior to the show.  Blackie, seeing Burley as competition for Mary's affections, is happy to tell him of their intent to marry.  However, as Blackie gloatingly tells Burley of their plans, it becomes clear that Blackie intends to take Mary away from the Tivoli and put her back on stage at the <i>Paradise</i>.  Burley appeals to Mary, but Blackie presents Mary with an ultimatum by asking if she wants to marry him or stay at the Tivoli.
</p><p>Mary's choice is to return to the <i>Paradise</i>.  Backstage, before the opening night of her return performance, she asks Blackie if they can set the date for their wedding.  Blackie agrees, but wants to postpone getting married until after the election. Father Tim drops in, and is angered by Mary's skimpy stage costume. He defies Blackie to put her on the stage in front of the rowdy <i>Paradise</i> audience.  Mary observes Blackie's reaction to Father Tim's statements, and decides to leave with the priest after Blackie strikes him in the face.
</p><p>Mary goes back to Burley and eventually meets his mother (<a href="/wiki/Jessie_Ralph" title="Jessie Ralph">Jessie Ralph</a>) at her <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nob_Hill" title="Nob Hill">Nob Hill</a> mansion. In a private conversation, she confesses her unworthiness, but Mrs. Burley informs Mary that she started out in 1850 as Massie, a simple washerwoman in <a href="/wiki/Portsmouth_Square" title="Portsmouth Square">Portsmouth Square</a>. Mrs. Burley also empathizes that she also once had a "Blackie" in her younger days, but chose to marry the more steadfast elder Burley.  This cements Mary's decision to accept Burley's proposal of marriage.
</p><p>It is now the evening of April 17, 1906.  Burley has called in some favors and had the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Police_Department" title="San Francisco Police Department">San Francisco Police Department</a> raid the <i>Paradise</i>, destroying its gambling equipment and running off the patrons. Blackie, distraught about the future of his club, ends up at the city's annual Chickens Ball.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> Mary and Burley are in attendance.  After performances by acts from the other Barbary Coast clubs, the MC requests the <i>Paradise's</i> entry. When no one steps on stage, Mary, just having learned of the club's closing, enters the Chickens Ball competition for the <i>Paradise</i>. She rouses the audience to join in a chorus of "San Francisco", and wins. However, Blackie angrily refuses the prize money, tossing the prize cup and gold coins to the stage floor. He angrily states that Mary had no right to sing on behalf of his club. Embarrassed, Mary is about to leave the ball with Burley.
</p><p>Then, at 5:13 a.m. April 18, 1906, <a href="/wiki/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake" title="1906 San Francisco earthquake">the earthquake hits the city</a>. The city is devastated and hundreds are killed.
</p><p>As Blackie wanders the city searching for Mary, he walks to Nob Hill, where he sees Mrs. Burley, who senses her son has died. (Blackie did indeed witness the dead Burley when wandering the devastated streets.)  She leaves the area as US Army troops from the <a href="/wiki/Presidio_of_San_Francisco" title="Presidio of San Francisco">Presidio</a> blow up her mansion in preparation making a <a href="/wiki/Firebreak" title="Firebreak">firebreak</a>. Blackie then comes upon Mat, who was injured at the destroyed Hall of Justice on Washington Street.  A nurse indicates to Blackie that Mat is dying. Before he dies, Mat tells Blackie he was wrong about his feelings toward Mary.
</p><p>Blackie later meets Father Tim, who takes him to <a href="/wiki/Golden_Gate_Park" title="Golden Gate Park">Golden Gate Park</a>, where there is a tent camp for the homeless. There, Blackie hears Mary's voice lifted in song "<a href="/wiki/Nearer,_My_God,_to_Thee" title="Nearer, My God, to Thee">Nearer, My God, to Thee</a>"  with those in mourning. After seeing Mary, Blackie falls to his knees and thanks God for sparing Mary's life. From a distance, Mary sees Blackie praying, and as she walks toward him, word spreads through the camp that "The fire's out!" As people shout about building a new San Francisco, Blackie and Mary join the crowd (a surprisingly multi-racial group, given the era of the film) as they leave the park marching arm-in-arm, singing "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Battle_Hymn_of_the_Republic" title="The Battle Hymn of the Republic">The Battle Hymn of the Republic</a>".  
</p><p>The film ends with a dissolve from the smoldering ruins into the "modern" San Francisco of the mid-1930s. (Each year when the film is shown near April 18 by Bay Area television stations, the scenes of the 1930s city are replaced with stock news footage of the city in the current year.)
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Snow_White_(Disney_character)" title="Snow White (Disney character)">Snow White</a> is a lonely princess living with her stepmother, a vain <a href="/wiki/Evil_Queen_(Disney)" title="Evil Queen (Disney)">Queen</a>. The Queen worries that Snow White will look better than she, so she forces Snow White to work as a <a href="/wiki/Scullery_maid" title="Scullery maid">scullery maid</a> and asks her <a href="/wiki/Magic_Mirror_(Snow_White)" title="Magic Mirror (Snow White)">Magic Mirror</a> daily "who is the fairest one of all". For years the mirror always answers that the Queen is, pleasing her.
</p><p>One day, the Magic Mirror informs the Queen that Snow White is now "the fairest" in the land. The jealous Queen orders her <a href="/wiki/Huntsman_(Snow_White)" title="Huntsman (Snow White)">Huntsman</a> to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. She further demands that the huntsman return with Snow White's heart in a jeweled box as proof of the deed. However, the Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White. He tearfully begs for her forgiveness, revealing the Queen wants her dead and urges her to flee into the woods and never look back. Lost and frightened, the princess is befriended by woodland creatures who lead her to a cottage deep in the woods. Finding seven small chairs in the cottage's dining room, Snow White assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children.
</p><p>In reality, the cottage belongs to seven adult <a href="/wiki/Dwarf_(mythology)" title="Dwarf (mythology)">dwarfs</a>—named Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey—who work in a nearby mine. Returning home, they are alarmed to find their cottage clean and suspect that an intruder has invaded their home. The dwarfs find Snow White upstairs, asleep across three of their beds. Snow White awakes to find the dwarfs at her bedside and introduces herself, and all of the dwarfs eventually welcome her into their home after she offers to clean and cook for them. Snow White keeps house for the dwarfs while they mine for jewels during the day, and at night they all sing, play music and dance.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the Queen discovers that Snow White is still alive when the mirror again answers that Snow White is the fairest in the land and reveals that the heart in the jeweled box is actually that of a pig. Using a potion to disguise herself as an old <a href="/wiki/Hag" title="Hag">hag</a>, the Queen creates a poisoned apple that will put whoever eats it into the "Sleeping Death", a curse she learns can only be broken by "love's first kiss", but is certain Snow White will be buried alive. While the Queen goes to the cottage while the dwarfs are away, the animals are wary of her and rush off to find the dwarfs. Faking a potential heart attack, the Queen tricks Snow White into bringing her into the cottage to rest. The Queen fools Snow White into biting into the poisoned apple under the pretense that it is a magic apple that grants wishes. As Snow White falls asleep, the Queen proclaims that she is now the fairest of the land. The dwarfs return with the animals as the Queen leaves the cottage and give chase, trapping her on a cliff. She tries to roll a boulder over them, but before she can do so, lightning strikes the cliff, causing her to fall to her death.
</p><p>The dwarfs return to their cottage and find Snow White seemingly dead, being kept in a deathlike slumber by the poison. Unwilling to bury her out of sight in the ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin trimmed with gold in a clearing in the forest. Together with the woodland creatures, they keep watch over her. A year later, a prince who had previously met and fallen in love with Snow White learns of her eternal sleep and visits her coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the Prince takes Snow White to his castle.
</p><p>A successful banker, Anthony P. Kirby (<a href="/wiki/Edward_Arnold_(actor)" title="Edward Arnold (actor)">Edward Arnold</a>), has just returned from <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, where he was effectively granted a government-sanctioned <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Munitions" title="Munitions">munitions</a> <a href="/wiki/Monopoly" title="Monopoly">monopoly</a>, which will make him very rich. He intends to buy up a 12-block radius around a competitor's factory to put him out of business, but there is one house that is a holdout to selling. Kirby instructs his real estate broker, John Blakely (<a href="/wiki/Clarence_Wilson_(actor)" title="Clarence Wilson (actor)">Clarence Wilson</a>), to offer a huge sum for the house, and if that is not accepted, to cause trouble for the family.  Meanwhile Grandpa Vanderhof (<a href="/wiki/Lionel_Barrymore" title="Lionel Barrymore">Lionel Barrymore</a>) convinces a banker named Poppins to pursue his dream of making animated toys.
</p><p>Kirby's son, Tony (<a href="/wiki/James_Stewart" title="James Stewart">James Stewart</a>), a vice president in the family company, has fallen in love with a company <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stenographer" title="Stenographer">stenographer</a>, Alice Sycamore (<a href="/wiki/Jean_Arthur" title="Jean Arthur">Jean Arthur</a>). When Tony proposes marriage, Alice is worried that her family would be looked upon poorly by Tony's rich and famous family. In fact, Alice is the only relatively normal member of the eccentric Sycamore family, led by Vanderhof. Unbeknownst to the players, Alice's family lives in the house that will not sell out.
</p><p>Kirby and his wife (<a href="/wiki/Mary_Forbes" title="Mary Forbes">Mary Forbes</a>) strongly disapprove of Tony's choice for marriage. Before she accepts, Alice forces Tony to bring his family to become better acquainted with their future in-laws. But when Tony purposely brings his family on the wrong day, the Sycamore family is caught off-guard and the house is in disarray. As the Kirbys are preparing to leave after a rather disastrous meeting, the police arrive in response to the printed threats on Ed Carmichael's flyers, and when the fireworks in the basement go off, they arrest everyone in the house.
</p><p>Held up in the <a href="/wiki/Drunk_tank" title="Drunk tank">drunk tank</a> preparing to see the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Night_court" title="Night court">night court</a> judge, Mrs. Kirby repeatedly insults Alice and makes her feel unworthy of her son, while Grandpa explains to Kirby the importance of having friends and that despite all the wealth and success in business, "you can't take it with you". At the court hearing, the judge (<a href="/wiki/Harry_Davenport_(actor)" title="Harry Davenport (actor)">Harry Davenport</a>) allows for Grandpa and his family to settle the charges for disturbing the peace and making illegal fireworks by assessing a fine, which Grandpa's friends pitch in to pay for. He repeatedly asks why the Kirbys were at the Vanderhof house. When Grandpa says it was to talk over selling the house, Alice has an outburst and says it was because she was engaged to Tony but is spurning him because of how poorly she has been treated by his family. This causes a sensation in the papers, and Alice flees the city.
</p><p>With Alice gone, Grandpa decides to sell the house, thus meaning the whole section of the town must vacate in preparation for building a new factory. Now, the Kirby companies merge, creating a huge fluctuation in the stock market.  When Kirby's competitor, Ramsey (<a href="/wiki/H._B._Warner" title="H. B. Warner">H. B. Warner</a>), dies after confronting him for being ruthless and a failure of a man, Kirby has a realization he is heading for the same fate, and decides to leave the meeting where the signing the contracts is to take place.
</p><p>As the Vanderhofs are moving out of the house, Tony tries to track down Alice. Kirby arrives and talks privately with Grandpa, sharing his realization. Grandpa responds by inviting him to play "<a href="/wiki/Polly_Wolly_Doodle" title="Polly Wolly Doodle">Polly Wolly Doodle</a>" on the harmonica that he gave him. The two let loose with the rest of the family joining in the merriment, and with Alice taking Tony back. Later, at the dinner table, Grandpa says grace for the Sycamore family and the Kirbys, revealing that Kirby has sold back the houses on the block.

Scarlett learns that <a href="/wiki/Ashley_Wilkes" title="Ashley Wilkes">Ashley Wilkes</a>—whom she secretly loves—is to be <a href="/wiki/Cousin_marriage" title="Cousin marriage">married to his cousin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Melanie_Hamilton" title="Melanie Hamilton">Melanie Hamilton</a>, and the engagement is to be announced the next day at a barbecue at Ashley's home, the nearby plantation <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Oaks" title="Twelve Oaks">Twelve Oaks</a>.
</p><p>At the Twelve Oaks party, Scarlett privately declares her feelings to Ashley, but he rebuffs her by responding that he and Melanie are more compatible. Scarlett is incensed when she discovers another guest, <a href="/wiki/Rhett_Butler" title="Rhett Butler">Rhett Butler</a>, has overheard their conversation. The barbecue is disrupted by the declaration of war and the men rush to enlist. As Scarlett watches Ashley kiss Melanie goodbye, Melanie's younger brother Charles proposes to her. Although she does not love him, Scarlett consents and they are married before he leaves to fight.
</p><p>Scarlett is widowed when Charles dies from a bout of <a href="/wiki/Pneumonia" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Measles" title="Measles">measles</a> while serving in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Confederate_Army" title="Confederate Army">Confederate Army</a>. Scarlett's mother sends her to the Hamilton home in <a href="/wiki/Atlanta" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> to cheer her up, although the O'Haras' outspoken house slave Mammy tells Scarlett she knows she is going there only to wait for Ashley's return. Scarlett, who should not attend a party while in mourning, attends a charity bazaar in Atlanta with Melanie where she meets Rhett again, now a <a href="/wiki/Blockade_runner" title="Blockade runner">blockade runner</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" title="Confederate States of America">Confederacy</a>. Celebrating a Confederate victory and to raise money for the Confederate war effort, gentlemen are invited to bid for ladies to dance with them. Rhett makes an inordinately large bid for Scarlett and, to the disapproval of the guests, she agrees to dance with him.
</p><p>The tide of war turns against the Confederacy after the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg" title="Battle of Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a> in which many of the men of Scarlett's town are killed. Scarlett makes another unsuccessful appeal to Ashley while he is visiting on Christmas <a href="/wiki/Furlough" title="Furlough">furlough</a>, although they do share a private and passionate kiss in the parlor on Christmas Day, just before he returns to war.
</p><p>Eight months later, as the city is besieged by the <a href="/wiki/Union_Army" title="Union Army">Union Army</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Atlanta_Campaign" title="Atlanta Campaign">Atlanta Campaign</a>, Scarlett and her young house slave Prissy must deliver Melanie's baby without medical assistance after she goes into premature labor. Afterwards, Scarlett calls upon Rhett to take her home to Tara with Melanie, her baby, and Prissy; he collects them in a horse and wagon, but once out of the city chooses to go off to fight, leaving Scarlett and the group to make their own way back to Tara. Upon her return home, Scarlett finds Tara deserted, except for her father, her sisters, and two former slaves: Mammy and Pork. Scarlett learns that her mother has just died of <a href="/wiki/Typhoid_fever" title="Typhoid fever">typhoid fever</a> and her father has become incompetent. With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett vows she will do anything for the survival of her family and herself.
</p><p>As the O'Haras work in the cotton fields, Scarlett's father is killed after he is thrown from his horse in an attempt to chase away a <a href="/wiki/Scalawag" title="Scalawag">scalawag</a> from his land. With the defeat of the Confederacy, Ashley also returns, but finds he is of little help at Tara. When Scarlett begs him to run away with her, he confesses his desire for her and kisses her passionately, but says he cannot leave Melanie. Unable to pay the taxes on Tara implemented by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reconstruction_Era" title="Reconstruction Era">Reconstructionists</a>, Scarlett dupes her younger sister Suellen's fiancé, the middle-aged and wealthy mill owner Frank Kennedy, into marrying her, by saying Suellen got tired of waiting and married another suitor.
</p><p>Frank, Ashley, Rhett and several other accomplices make a night raid on a <a href="/wiki/Shanty_town" title="Shanty town">shanty town</a> after Scarlett is attacked while driving through it alone, resulting in Frank's death. With Frank's funeral barely over, Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she accepts. They have a daughter whom Rhett names Bonnie Blue, but Scarlett, still pining for Ashley and chagrined at the perceived ruin of her figure, lets Rhett know that she wants no more children and that they will no longer share a bed.
</p><p>One day at Frank's mill, Scarlett and Ashley are seen embracing by Ashley's sister, India, and harboring an intense dislike of Scarlett she eagerly spreads rumors. Later that evening, Rhett, having heard the rumors, forces Scarlett to attend a birthday party for Ashley. Incapable of believing anything bad of her, Melanie stands by Scarlett's side so that all know that she believes the gossip to be false. After returning home from the party, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk, and they argue about Ashley. Rhett kisses Scarlett against her will, stating his intent to have sex with her that night, and carries the struggling Scarlett to the bedroom. The next day, Rhett apologizes for his behavior and offers Scarlett a divorce, which she rejects, saying that it would be a disgrace. When Rhett returns from an extended trip to London, Scarlett informs him that she is pregnant, but an argument ensues which results in her falling down a flight of stairs and suffering a <a href="/wiki/Miscarriage" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a>. As she is recovering, tragedy strikes when Bonnie dies while attempting to jump a fence with her pony.
</p><p>Scarlett and Rhett visit Melanie, who has suffered complications arising from a new pregnancy, on her deathbed. As Scarlett consoles Ashley, Rhett prepares to leave Atlanta. Having realized that it was he she truly loved all along, and not Ashley, Scarlett pleads with Rhett to stay, but Rhett rebuffs her and walks away into the morning fog, leaving her in tears on the staircase, vowing to one day win back his love.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Jiminy_Cricket" title="Jiminy Cricket">Jiminy Cricket</a> explains that he is going to tell a story of a wish coming true. His story begins in the Italian workshop of a woodworker named <a href="/wiki/Mister_Geppetto" title="Mister Geppetto">Geppetto</a>. Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names <a href="/wiki/Pinocchio" title="Pinocchio">Pinocchio</a>. Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio be a real boy. During the night, a <a href="/wiki/The_Fairy_with_Turquoise_Hair" title="The Fairy with Turquoise Hair">Blue Fairy</a> visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience.
</p><p>Geppetto discovers that his wish has come true, and is filled with joy. However, on his way to school, Pinocchio is led astray by <a href="/wiki/The_Fox_and_the_Cat" title="The Fox and the Cat">Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat</a>, who convince him to join <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stromboli_(Pinocchio)" title="Stromboli (Pinocchio)">Stromboli</a>'s puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio, and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy appears, and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. Pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the Blue Fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets him free, while warning him that this will be the last time she can help him.

Without rules or authority to enforce their activity, Pinocchio and the other boys soon engage in <a href="/wiki/Tobacco_smoking" title="Tobacco smoking">smoking</a> <a href="/wiki/Tobacco" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gambling" title="Gambling">gambling</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vandalism" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a>, and getting <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Drunk" title="Drunk">drunk</a>, much to Jiminy's dismay. Later, while trying to get home, Jiminy discovers that the island hides a horrible curse: the boys brought to Pleasure Island are transformed into <a href="/wiki/Donkey" title="Donkey">donkeys</a> for their misbehavior and sold into slave labor. Jiminy runs back to warn Pinocchio, only to discover that Lampwick has transformed into a donkey; Pinocchio manages to escape, only partially transformed.
</p><p>Upon returning home, Pinocchio and Jiminy find the workshop vacant. They soon get a letter from the blue fairy as a dove, stating that Geppetto had ventured out to sea to save Pinocchio from Pleasure Island, but was swallowed by a terrible <a href="/wiki/Sperm_whale" title="Sperm whale">giant whale</a> named <a href="/wiki/The_Terrible_Dogfish" title="The Terrible Dogfish">Monstro</a>, and is now living in his belly. Determined to rescue his father, Pinocchio jumps into the sea accompanied by Jiminy. Pinocchio is soon swallowed by Monstro as well, where he is reunited with Geppetto. Pinocchio devises a scheme to make Monstro sneeze, giving them a chance to escape. The scheme works, but the enraged whale-monster chases them and smashes their raft. Pinocchio pulls Geppetto to safety in a cave before Monstro crashes into it. Geppetto, Figaro, Cleo, and Jiminy are washed up safely on a beach, but Pinocchio is killed.
</p><p>Back home, Geppetto grieves over Pinocchio with Jiminy Cricket and the pets also mourn alongside. The Blue Fairy, however, decides that Pinocchio has proven himself brave, truthful, and unselfish. To reward him, the Blue Fairy resurrects Pinocchio, reversing the Pleasure Island curse and turning him into a real boy. Pinocchio awakens and reveals that he is alive and a real human boy, and everyone celebrates. Jiminy steps outside to thank the Fairy, and is rewarded with a solid gold badge that certifies him as an official conscience.
</p><p>"Big John" McMasters (<a href="/wiki/Clark_Gable" title="Clark Gable">Clark Gable</a>) and "Square John" Sand (<a href="/wiki/Spencer_Tracy" title="Spencer Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a>) are two down-on-their-luck oil <a href="/wiki/Wildcatter" title="Wildcatter">wildcatters</a> who join forces. Without enough money, they steal drilling equipment from a skeptical Luther Aldrich (<a href="/wiki/Frank_Morgan" title="Frank Morgan">Frank Morgan</a>). Their well proves a bust and they have to hastily depart when Aldrich shows up with the sheriff to take back his property. The two oilmen team up and make enough money to partially pay Aldrich. To get him to back them for a second try, they cut him in for a percentage of the well. This time, they strike it rich.
</p><p>When Elizabeth 'Betsy' Bartlett (<a href="/wiki/Claudette_Colbert" title="Claudette Colbert">Claudette Colbert</a>) shows up, McMasters sweeps her off her feet (without knowing that Sand considers her his girl) and marries her. Sand accepts the situation, wanting Betsy to be happy. However, on their first anniversary, she catches her husband dancing with a barroom floozy. As a result, Sand quarrels with McMasters and they flip a coin for the entire oilfield. Betsy leaves too, but returns when she learns that her husband has lost almost everything to Sand and needs her.
</p><p>Each man goes through booms and busts. Building on his renewed success as a wildcatter, McMasters moves to New York to expand into refineries and distribution, competing against former customer Harry Compton (<a href="/wiki/Lionel_Atwill" title="Lionel Atwill">Lionel Atwill</a>). Seeking inside information about his rivals, he hires away Compton's adviser Karen Vanmeer (<a href="/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr" title="Hedy Lamarr">Hedy Lamarr</a>), who uses her social contacts and womanly charms to gather industry information.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Sand loses everything he has built up in South America to a revolution. When he meets McMasters at an oilmen's convention, the two finally reconcile, and Sand goes to work for his old friend. When he suspects that McMasters is carrying on an affair with Karen, he tries to save Betsy's marriage by offering to marry Karen. However, she deduces his motives and declines. When a miserable Betsy tries to commit suicide by taking sleeping pills, Sand decides that the only way to help her is to bankrupt McMasters. Sand loses his costly battle with his former friend and goes broke. It is only when he asks McMasters to give his wife a divorce that the married man finally comes to his senses. Later, McMasters is prosecuted by the government for violating the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act" title="Sherman Antitrust Act">Sherman Antitrust Act</a> and loses his business. In the end, poor, but happier, Sand and McMasters team up again, with the blissful Betsy looking on. Aldrich supplies them with equipment and the whole cycle begins again.
</p><p>Alvin York, a poor young farmer from the rural area near <a href="/wiki/Pall_Mall,_Tennessee" title="Pall Mall, Tennessee">Pall Mall, Tennessee</a>, lives a hardscrabble existence in a community whose poverty and isolation leave them with a lifestyle hardly different from people of a century earlier. He is an exceptional marksman, but a ne'er-do-well prone to drinking and fighting, which does not make things any easier for his long-suffering, widowed mother. 
</p><p>Alvin's farm is on rocky land high in the mountains, which barely supports him and his siblings. He meets a sweet-natured local girl, Gracie Williams, and works night and day at strenuous odd jobs to accumulate the payment for a fertile "bottomland" farm so she'll marry him.  The owner, Tomkins, gives Alvin sixty days to raise the purchase price. On the day the last payment is due, Alvin wins the final needed amount at a target-shooting contest, but discovers Tomkins has reneged and sold the farm to Alvin's romantic rival, Zeb Andrews, keeping all of the partial payments Alvin had made. Alvin drinks heavily and swears revenge.
</p><p>That night, en route to attack Tomkins and Andrews, the rifle Alvin is holding is struck by lightning, splitting the barrel in two and knocking him off his mule. Similar to <a href="/wiki/Conversion_of_Paul_the_Apostle" title="Conversion of Paul the Apostle">the biblical conversion of Paul</a>, York survives the lightning strike and undergoes a religious awakening when he joins a revival meeting at the nearby church, vowing never to get drunk or angry again.  He makes amends with the men who cheated him out of the land, while Gracie points out that her love is tied to him and not the bottomland.
</p><p>When the U.S. enters <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> and York is drafted into the army, he tries to avoid induction into the Army as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Conscientious_objection" title="Conscientious objection">conscientious objector</a>, but is denied since his church has no official standing. He reluctantly reports to <a href="/wiki/Fort_Gordon" title="Fort Gordon">Camp Gordon</a> for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Basic_training" title="Basic training">basic training</a>, where he is harassed because of his objector status, but his superiors eventually discover that he is a phenomenal marksman and decide to promote him to <a href="/wiki/Corporal#United_States" title="Corporal">corporal</a>.
</p><p>York still wants nothing to do with the Army and killing. Major <a href="/wiki/G._Edward_Buxton_Jr." title="G. Edward Buxton Jr.">Buxton</a>, his sympathetic commanding officer, tries to change York's mind, citing sacrifices made by others throughout the history of the United States. He gives York a leave to go home and think it over. He promises York a recommendation for his exemption as a conscientious objector if York remains unconvinced.
</p><p>While York is fasting and pondering, the wind blows his Bible open to the verse "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's." York reports back for duty and tells his superiors that he can serve his country, despite not having everything figured out to his satisfaction, leaving the matter in <a href="/wiki/God" title="God">God</a>'s hands.
</p><p>His unit is shipped out to Europe and participates in an attack during the <a href="/wiki/Meuse-Argonne_Offensive" title="Meuse-Argonne Offensive">Meuse-Argonne Offensive</a> on October 8, 1918. Pinned down by deadly machine gun fire, the lieutenant orders Sergeant Early to take some men and try to attack the machine gun nests from behind. York suddenly finds himself the last remaining unwounded <a href="/wiki/Non-commissioned_officer" title="Non-commissioned officer">non-commissioned officer</a> in the detachment, and is placed in command by Early.
</p><p>Seeing his comrades being shot down all around him, his self-doubt disappears. He works his way to a position flanking the main enemy trench and, as a sniper, fires individual rifle shots with such devastating effect that the Germans surrender. Then, York forces a captured officer at gunpoint to order the Germans still fighting in another section of the line to also surrender. He and the handful of other survivors end up with 132 prisoners. York becomes a national hero and is awarded the <a href="/wiki/Medal_of_Honor" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honor</a>. When Major Buxton asks him why he did what he did, York explains that he was trying to save the lives of his men.
</p><p>Arriving in New York City in early 1919, York receives a ticker tape parade and a key to the city.  He is impressed with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Waldorf-Astoria_hotel" title="Waldorf-Astoria hotel">Waldorf-Astoria hotel</a> and its indoor electricity.  Congressman <a href="/wiki/Cordell_Hull" title="Cordell Hull">Cordell Hull</a> guides him through the city and informs him that he has been offered opportunities to commercialize on his fame, all totaling around $250,000 (for context, $3.6 million today). York mentions the bottomland he wanted and Hull responds he could buy it with the money. York rejects the offers, however, saying that he was not proud of what he did in the war, but it had to be done, and he will not profit from his fame. He tells Hull he wants to go home. He returns to <a href="/wiki/Tennessee" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> greeted by Gracie and his family. To his surprise, the people of his home state have bought him the bottomland farm he wanted and built him a house on the land.
</p><p>A doe gives birth to a fawn named Bambi, who will one day take over the position of Great Prince of the Forest, a title currently held by Bambi's father, who guards the woodland creatures from the dangers of hunters. The fawn is quickly befriended by an eager, energetic rabbit named <a href="/wiki/Thumper_(Bambi)" title="Thumper (Bambi)">Thumper</a>, who helps to teach him to walk and speak. Bambi grows up very attached to his mother, with whom he spends most of his time. He soon makes other friends, including a young skunk named Flower and a female fawn named <a href="/wiki/Faline" title="Faline">Faline</a>. Curious and inquisitive, Bambi frequently asks about the world around him and is cautioned about the dangers of life as a forest creature by his loving mother. One day out in a meadow, Bambi briefly sees The Great Prince but does not realize that he is his father. As the great prince wanders uphill, he discovers the human hunter named "Man" by all the animals is coming and rushes down to the meadow to get everyone to safety. Bambi is briefly separated from his mother during that scene but is escorted to her by the Great Prince as the three of them make it back in the forest just as Man fires his gun.
</p><p>During Bambi's first winter, he and Thumper play in the snow while Flower hibernates. One day his mother takes him along to find food, when Man shows up again. As they escape his mother is shot and killed by the hunter, leaving the little fawn mournful and alone. Taking pity on his abandoned son, the Great Prince leads Bambi home as he reveals to him that he is his father. Next year, Bambi has matured into a young stag, and his childhood friends have entered young adulthood as well. They are warned of "twitterpation" by Friend Owl and that they will eventually fall in love, although the trio view the concept of romance with scorn. However, Thumper and Flower soon both encounter their beautiful romantic counterparts and abandon their former thoughts on love. Bambi himself encounters Faline as a beautiful doe. However, their courtship is quickly interrupted and challenged by a belligerent older stag named Ronno, who attempts to force Faline away from Bambi. Bambi successfully manages to defeat Ronno in battle and earn the rights to the doe's affections.
</p><p>Bambi is awakened shortly afterward by the smell of smoke, he follows it and discovers it leads to a hunter camp. Bambi is warned by his father that Man has returned with more hunters. The two flee to safety, although Bambi is separated from Faline in the turmoil and searches for her along the way. He soon finds her cornered by Man's vicious hunting dogs, which he manages to ward off. Meanwhile, at the "Man's" camp their campfire, unattended, spreads into the forest, resulting in a wildfire from which the forest residents flee in fear. Bambi, his father, Faline, and the forest animals manage to reach shelter on a <a href="/wiki/Bank_(geography)" title="Bank (geography)">riverbank</a>. The following spring, Faline gives birth to twins under Bambi's watchful eye as the new Great Prince of the Forest.
</p><p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kay_Miniver" title="Kay Miniver">Kay Miniver</a> (<a href="/wiki/Greer_Garson" title="Greer Garson">Greer Garson</a>) and her family live a comfortable life at a house called "Starlings" in Belham, a fictional village outside London. The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the <a href="/wiki/River_Thames" title="River Thames">River Thames</a> at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband, Clem (<a href="/wiki/Walter_Pidgeon" title="Walter Pidgeon">Walter Pidgeon</a>), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby (<a href="/wiki/Christopher_Severn" title="Christopher Severn">Christopher Severn</a>) and Judy (<a href="/wiki/Clare_Sandars" title="Clare Sandars">Clare Sandars</a>), and an older son, Vin (<a href="/wiki/Richard_Ney" title="Richard Ney">Richard Ney</a>), a student at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxford_University" title="Oxford University">Oxford University</a>. They have live-in staff: Gladys, the housemaid (<a href="/wiki/Brenda_Forbes" title="Brenda Forbes">Brenda Forbes</a>), and Ada, the cook (<a href="/wiki/Marie_De_Becker" title="Marie De Becker">Marie De Becker</a>).
</p><p>As <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> looms, Vin returns from the university and meets Carol Beldon (<a href="/wiki/Teresa_Wright" title="Teresa Wright">Teresa Wright</a>), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dame_May_Whitty" title="Dame May Whitty">Dame May Whitty</a>) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreements—mainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruism—they fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic, but more honest, proposal. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must "do his bit", and enlists in the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Air_Force" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a>, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home, and is able to signal his safe return from operations to his parents by "blipping" his engine briefly (rapidly open and closing the throttle, which results in short, sharp roars of sound) as he flies over the house. Together with other boat owners, Clem volunteers to take his motorboat, the <i>Starling</i>, to assist in the <a href="/wiki/Dunkirk_evacuation" title="Dunkirk evacuation">Dunkirk evacuation</a>.
</p><p>Early one morning, Kay, unable to sleep as Clem is still away, wanders down to the landing stage. She is startled to discover a wounded <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">German</a> pilot (<a href="/wiki/Helmut_Dantine" title="Helmut Dantine">Helmut Dantine</a>) hiding in her garden, and he takes her to the house at gunpoint. Demanding food and a coat, the pilot aggressively asserts that the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Third_Reich" title="Third Reich">Third Reich</a> will mercilessly overcome its enemies. She feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and then calls the police. Soon after, Clem returns home, exhausted, from Dunkirk.
</p><p>Lady Beldon visits Kay to try and convince her to talk Vin out of marrying Carol on account of her granddaughter's comparative youth at age eighteen. Kay reminds Her Ladyship that she, too, had been young — sixteen, in fact — when she married her late husband. Lady Beldon concedes defeat, and realizes that it would be futile to try to stop the marriage. Vin and Carol marry; Carol has now also become a Mrs Miniver, and they return from their honeymoon in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. A key theme is that she knows Vin is likely to be killed in action, but the short love will fill her life. Later, Kay and her family take refuge in their <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anderson_shelter" title="Anderson shelter">Anderson shelter</a> in the garden during an air raid, and attempt to keep their minds off the frightening bombing by reading <i><a href="/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland" title="Alice's Adventures in Wonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a></i>, which Clem refers to as a "lovely story". They barely survive as a bomb destroys part of Starlings. The Minivers take the damage with nonchalance.
</p><p>At the annual village flower show, Lady Beldon silently disregards the judges' decision that her rose is the winner, instead announcing the rose entered by the local stationmaster, Mr. Ballard (<a href="/wiki/Henry_Travers" title="Henry Travers">Henry Travers</a>), named the "Mrs. Miniver", as the winner, with her own Beldon Rose taking second prize. As air raid sirens sound, and the villagers take refuge in the cellars of Beldon Hall, Kay and Carol drive Vin to join his squadron. On their journey home, they witness fighter planes in a dogfight. For safety, Kay stops the car, and they see a German plane crash. Kay realizes Carol has been wounded by machine gun fire from the plane, and takes her back to Starlings. She dies a few minutes after they reach home. Kay is devastated. When Vin returns from battle, he already knows the terrible news: Ironically, he is the survivor, and she the one who died.
</p><p>The villagers assemble at the badly damaged church where their vicar affirms their determination in a powerful sermon:
</p><p>A solitary Lady Beldon stands in her family's church pew. Vin moves to stand alongside her, united in shared grief, as the members of the congregation rise and stoically sing "<a href="/wiki/Onward,_Christian_Soldiers" title="Onward, Christian Soldiers">Onward, Christian Soldiers</a>", while through a gaping hole in the bombed church roof can be seen flight after flight of RAF fighters in the V-for-Victory formation heading out to face the enemy.
</p><p>During the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>, an American language teacher, Robert Jordan (<a href="/wiki/Gary_Cooper" title="Gary Cooper">Gary Cooper</a>), who lived in Spain during the pre-war period, fights in the <a href="/wiki/International_Brigades" title="International Brigades">International Brigades</a> against <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Franco" title="Francisco Franco">Francisco Franco</a>'s forces. An experienced dynamiter, Jordan is ordered to travel behind enemy lines and destroy a critical bridge with the aid of a band of local anti-fascist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Guerrillas" title="Guerrillas">guerrillas</a>. The bridge must be blown up to prevent enemy troops from traveling across it to respond to an upcoming offensive against the fascists.
</p><p>Jordan meets an old man, Anselmo, who is a guerrilla fighter who will serve as Jordan's liaison with the local guerrilla fighters. Anselmo leads Jordan to a group of Republican guerrillas who are led by a middle-aged man named Pablo. Jordan falls in love one of the guerrillas, a young woman named María. María's life was shattered by her parents' execution and her gang-rape at the hands of the <a href="/wiki/Falangism" title="Falangism">Falangists</a> (part of the fascist coalition) at the outbreak of the war. Jordan has a strong sense of duty, which clashes with the unwillingness of the guerrilla leader Pablo to commit to helping with the bridge-blowing operation, as it would endanger himself and his band. At the same time, Jordan develops a new-found lust for life which arises from his love for María. Pablo's wife Pilar displaces Pablo as the group leader and pledges the allegiance of the guerrillas to Jordan's mission. However, when another band of anti-fascist guerrillas, led by El Sordo, is surrounded and killed in a desperate <a href="/wiki/Last_stand" title="Last stand">last stand</a>, Pablo destroys Jordan's dynamite detonation equipment, hoping to prevent the bridge demolition and thereby avoid fascist reprisals on his camp. Later, Pablo regrets abandoning his comrades and returns to assist in the operation.
</p><p>However, the enemy, apprised of the coming offensive, has prepared to ambush the Republicans in force and it seems unlikely that blowing up the bridge will do much to prevent a <a href="/wiki/Rout" title="Rout">rout</a>. Regardless, Jordan understands that he must still demolish the bridge in an attempt to prevent fascist reinforcements from overwhelming his allies. Lacking the equipment destroyed by Pablo, Jordan and Anselmo improvise an alternative method to explode the dynamite by using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hand_grenade" title="Hand grenade">hand grenades</a>. Jordan attaches wires to the grenades so that their pins can be pulled from a distance. This improvised plan is considerably more dangerous than using conventional detonators, because the men must increase their proximity to the explosion.
</p><p>While the guerrilla fighters—Pablo, Pilar, and María—create a diversion for Jordan and Anselmo, the two men plant and detonate the dynamite, costing Anselmo his life when he is hit by a piece of debris from the exploding bridge. While the guerrillas are escaping on horseback, Jordan is maimed when a fascist tank shoots his horse out from under him. Jordan cannot feel his legs and he knows that if his comrades stop to rescue him, they too will be captured or killed. He bids goodbye to María and ensures that she escapes to safety with the surviving guerrillas. Armed with a <a href="/wiki/Lewis_gun" title="Lewis gun">Lewis machine gun</a>, he waits until the horse-mounted fascist soldiers appear in his gun sights. He then pulls the trigger, firing a sweeping barrage at the oncoming soldiers. The film ends with Jordan firing the Lewis gun directly at the camera.
</p><p>In World War I song-and-dance man Jerry Jones (<a href="/wiki/George_Murphy" title="George Murphy">George Murphy</a>) is drafted into the US Army, where he stages a revue called <i>Yip Yip Yaphank.</i> It is a rousing success, but one night during the show orders are received to leave immediately for France: instead of the finale, the troops march up the aisles through the audience, out the theater's main entrance and into a convoy of waiting trucks. Among the teary, last-minute goodbyes Jones kisses his newlywed bride Ethel (<a href="/wiki/Rosemary_DeCamp" title="Rosemary DeCamp">Rosemary DeCamp</a>) farewell.
</p><p>In the trenches of France, several of the soldiers in the production are killed or wounded by shrapnel from a German artillery barrage. Jones is wounded in the leg and must walk with a cane, ending his career as a dancer. Nevertheless, he is resolved to find something useful to do, especially now that he is the father of a son. Sgt.

</p><p>Father Charles “Chuck” O’Malley, an incoming priest from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/East_St._Louis" title="East St. Louis">East St. Louis</a>, arrives in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> with an unconventional style that will transform the parish life of St. Dominic’s Church.
</p><p>On his first day, O'Malley gets into a series of mishaps; his informal appearance and attitude make a poor impression with the elder pastor, Father Fitzgibbon. The very traditional Fitzgibbon is further put off by O’Malley’s recreational habits – particularly his golf-playing – and his friendship with the even more casual Father Timmy O’Dowd. In a discussion between O'Malley and O'Dowd without Fitzgibbon present, it is revealed that O’Malley was sent by the bishop to take charge of the affairs of the parish, but that Fitzgibbon is to remain as pastor. To spare Fitzgibbon’s feelings, the older pastor is kept unaware of this arrangement and believes that O’Malley is simply his assistant.
</p><p>A series of events highlights the difference between O’Malley and Fitzgibbon’s styles, as they deal with events like a parishioner being evicted and a young woman named Carol James having run away from home. The most consequential difference of opinion between O’Malley and Fitzgibbon arises in their handling of the youth of the church, many of whom are consistently getting into trouble with the law in a gang led by Tony Scaponi. Fitzgibbon is inclined to look the other way, siding with the boys because of their frequent church attendance. O’Malley seeks to make inroads into the boys’ lives, befriending Scaponi and eventually convincing the boys to become a church choir.
</p><p>The noise of the practicing choir annoys Fitzgibbon, who finally decides to go to the bishop and ask for O’Malley to be transferred away. In the course of the conversation, Fitzgibbon infers the bishop’s intention to put O’Malley in charge of the parish. To avoid an uncomfortable situation, instead of making his initial request, Fitzgibbon asks the bishop to put O’Malley in charge, and then, resigned to his fate of losing control over the church, he informs O’Malley of his new role.
</p><p>A distressed Fitzgibbon then runs away, leading to a search. He returns late at night, and as O’Malley puts the older priest to bed, the two begin to bond. They discuss Fitzgibbon’s long-put-off desire to go to <a href="/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and see his mother, whom he has not seen since he left Ireland as a young priest to come to America, and who is now over 90. O’Malley puts Fitzgibbon to sleep with an Irish lullaby, “<a href="/wiki/Too_Ra_Loo_Ra_Loo_Ral" title="Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral">Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral</a>”.
</p><p>O'Malley runs into Jenny Tuffel, an old girlfriend whom he left to join the priesthood. Jenny now has a successful career with the <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_Opera" title="Metropolitan Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a>, performing under the stage name Genevieve Linden. As she prepares to go onstage as the lead in a performance of <i><a href="/wiki/Carmen" title="Carmen">Carmen</a></i>, the two discuss their past, and she learns that her world travels with a previous opera company caused her to miss his letter explaining he had entered the priesthood.
</p><p>O'Malley next pays a visit to Carol, who is now suspected of living in sin with Ted Haines Jr., the son of the church's mortgage-holder, Ted Haines Sr. On this visit, O’Malley describes to the young couple his calling in life to “go his way,” which to him means to follow after the joyous side of religion and lead others to do the same. He performs for them the song “Going My Way,” which he wrote on this theme.
</p><p>Jenny visits O’Malley at the church, sees the boys’ choir, and reads the sheet music of “Going My Way.” She, O'Malley, and Father O’Dowd devise a plan to rent out the Metropolitan, perform “Going My Way” with the choir and a full orchestra, then sell the rights to the song, thereby saving the church from its financial woes. The plan fails, as the music executive brought on to hear the song does not believe it will sell. The choir decides to make the most of its opportunity on the grand stage, and sings another song, "<a href="/wiki/Swinging_on_a_Star" title="Swinging on a Star">Swinging on a Star</a>". The executive overhears the song and decides to buy it, providing enough money to pay off the church mortgage.
</p><p>With the church affairs in order, O’Malley and Fitzgibbon go on a golf course together. Just as everything seems to have fallen into place, though, the parish church is damaged in a massive fire. O'Malley prepares to move on to a new assignment from the bishop. He leaves O’Dowd to be Fitzgibbon’s new assistant, putting Tony Scaponi in charge of the choir. On Christmas Eve, parishioners gather in a temporary church for a service that also serves as O'Malley's farewell. As a going-away present, O’Malley has sent for Fitzgibbon’s mother from Ireland. As mother and son embrace for the first time in 45 years, the choir sings “Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral”, as Father O’Malley quietly slips away into the night.
</p><p><i>Mom and Dad</i> tells the story of Joan Blake (<a href="/wiki/June_Carlson" title="June Carlson">June Carlson</a>), a young girl who falls for the pilot Jack Griffin (Bob Lowell). After being sweet talked by Griffin, she has sex with him. The girl requests "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Social_hygiene" title="Social hygiene">hygiene books</a>" from her mother Sarah Blake (Lois Austin); however, the mother refuses because the girl is not yet married.  The girl later learns from her father Dan Blake (George Eldredge) that the pilot has died in a crash. She tears up a letter she had been writing to him, and lowers her head as the film fades into intermission.

</p><p>The unconventional Father Charles "Chuck" O'Malley (<a href="/wiki/Bing_Crosby" title="Bing Crosby">Bing Crosby</a>) is assigned to St. Mary's parish, which includes a run-down inner-city school building on the verge of being condemned. O'Malley is to recommend whether or not the school should be closed and the children sent to another school with modern facilities; but the sisters feel that God will provide for them.

</p><p>Seven-year-old Johnny (<a href="/wiki/Bobby_Driscoll" title="Bobby Driscoll">Bobby Driscoll</a>) is excited about what he believes to be a vacation at his grandmother's Georgia plantation with his parents, John Sr. (Erik Rolf) and Sally (<a href="/wiki/Ruth_Warrick" title="Ruth Warrick">Ruth Warrick</a>). When they arrive at the plantation, he discovers that his parents will be living apart for a while, and he is to live at the plantation with his mother and grandmother (Lucile Watson) while his father returns to Atlanta to continue his controversial editorship in the city's newspaper. Johnny, distraught because of his father's departure, secretly sets off that night for Atlanta with only a <a href="/wiki/Bindle" title="Bindle">bindle</a>.
</p><p>As Johnny sneaks away from the plantation, he is attracted by the voice of <a href="/wiki/Uncle_Remus" title="Uncle Remus">Uncle Remus</a> (<a href="/wiki/James_Baskett" title="James Baskett">James Baskett</a>) telling tales of a character named <a href="/wiki/Br%27er_Rabbit" title="Br'er Rabbit">Br'er Rabbit</a>. By this time, word had gotten out that Johnny was missing, and some plantation residents are looking for him. Johnny evades being discovered, but Uncle Remus catches up with him. They befriend each other and Uncle Remus offers him some food for his journey, taking him back to his cabin. Back at the cabin, Uncle Remus tells Johnny the traditional African-American folktale, "<a href="/wiki/Br%27er_Rabbit_Earns_a_Dollar_a_Minute" title="Br'er Rabbit Earns a Dollar a Minute">Br'er Rabbit Earns a Dollar a Minute</a>". In the story, Br'er Rabbit (<a href="/wiki/Johnny_Lee_(actor)" title="Johnny Lee (actor)">Johnny Lee</a>) attempts to run away from home only to change his mind after an encounter with <a href="/wiki/Br%27er_Fox_and_Br%27er_Bear" title="Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear">Br'er Fox and Br'er Bear</a> (James Baskett and <a href="/wiki/Nick_Stewart" title="Nick Stewart">Nick Stewart</a>). Johnny takes the advice and changes his mind about leaving the plantation, letting Uncle Remus take him back to his mother.
</p><p>Johnny makes friends with Toby (Glenn Leedy), a young black boy who lives on the plantation, and Ginny Favers (<a href="/wiki/Luana_Patten" title="Luana Patten">Luana Patten</a>), a poor white girl. Ginny gives Johnny a puppy after her two older brothers, Joe (Gene Holland) and Jake (George Nokes), threaten to drown it. Johnny's mother refuses to let him take care of the puppy, so he takes the dog to Uncle Remus. Uncle Remus takes the dog in and delights Johnny and his friends with <a href="/wiki/Tar-Baby" title="Tar-Baby">the fable of Br'er Rabbit and the Tar-Baby</a>, stressing that people shouldn't get involved with something they have no business with in the first place. Johnny heeds the advice of how Br'er Rabbit used <a href="/wiki/Reverse_psychology" title="Reverse psychology">reverse psychology</a> on Br'er Fox and begs the Favers Brothers not to tell their mother (Mary Field) about the dog. The reverse psychology works, and the boys go to speak with their mother. After being spanked, they realize that Johnny had fooled them. In an act of revenge, they tell Sally about the dog. She becomes upset that Johnny and Uncle Remus kept the dog despite her order (which was unknown to Uncle Remus). She instructs Uncle Remus not to tell any more stories to her son.
</p><p>Johnny's birthday arrives and Johnny picks up Ginny to take her to his party. On the way there, Joe and Jake push Ginny into a mud puddle. With her dress ruined, Ginny is unable to go to the party and runs off crying. Johnny begins fighting with the boys, but their fight is broken up by Uncle Remus, who scolds Joe and Jake. Johnny runs off to comfort Ginny. He explains that he does not want to go either, especially since his father will not be there. Uncle Remus discovers both dejected children and cheers them up by telling the story of <a href="/wiki/The_Laughing_Place" title="The Laughing Place">Br'er Rabbit and his "Laughing Place"</a>. When the three return to the plantation, Sally becomes angry at Johnny for missing his own birthday party, and tells Uncle Remus not to spend any more time with him. Saddened by the misunderstanding of his good intentions, Uncle Remus packs his bags and leaves for Atlanta. Johnny rushes to intercept him, but is attacked by a bull and seriously injured after taking a shortcut through a pasture. While Johnny hovers between life and death, his father returns. Johnny calls for Uncle Remus, who is then escorted in by his grandmother. Uncle Remus begins telling a tale of Br'er Rabbit and the Laughing Place, and the boy miraculously survives.
</p><p>Johnny, Ginny, and Toby are next seen skipping along and singing while Johnny's returned puppy runs alongside them. Uncle Remus is also in the vicinity and he is shocked when Br'er Rabbit and several of the other characters from his stories appear in front of them and interact with the children. Uncle Remus rushes to join the group, and they all skip away singing.

All three have trouble adjusting to civilian life.
</p><p>Al is a banker with a comfortable home and a loving family: wife Milly, adult daughter Peggy, and high school student son Rob. He is promoted to Vice President in charge of small loans, as the president views his military experience as valuable in dealing with other returning servicemen. When Al approves an unsecured loan to a young Navy veteran, the president advises him against making a habit of it.  Later, at a banquet in his honor, a slightly inebriated Al expounds that the bank (and America) must stand with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Veterans" title="Veterans">vets</a> and give them every chance to rebuild their lives.

He does not want to burden Wilma with his handicap so he eventually pushes her away, although she still wants to marry him.

</p><p>When an obnoxious customer, who claims that the war was fought against the wrong enemies, gets into a fight with Homer, Fred intervenes and knocks the man down – costing him his job. Fred encourages Homer to put his misgivings behind him and marry Wilma, offering to be his best man.
</p><p>Wilma visits Homer and tells him that her parents want her to leave Boone City for an extended period to try to forget him. Homer bluntly demonstrates to her how hard life with him would be. When Wilma is undaunted, Homer reconsiders.
</p><p>Fred discovers his wife with another veteran. After complaining to Fred that she has "given up the best years of my life," Marie tells him that she is getting a divorce.

He calls Pearl "a half-breed" and jealously despises Pearl's father.
</p><p>The second son, Lewt (<a href="/wiki/Gregory_Peck" title="Gregory Peck">Gregory Peck</a>), is a ladies' man with a personality quite unlike that of his gentlemanly brother Jesse. He expresses his interest in Pearl in direct terms and she takes a strong dislike to him. Laura Belle calls in Mr. Jubal Crabbe, the "Sinkiller" (<a href="/wiki/Walter_Huston" title="Walter Huston">Walter Huston</a>), a gun-toting preacher, to counsel Pearl on how to avoid the evils of temptation. Pearl is determined to remain "a good girl."
</p><p>When she submits to Lewt's aggressive advances one night, Pearl is angry with him and ashamed of her own behavior. But she also cannot help but be flattered by his lust and attentions. Jesse, meanwhile, is ostracized by his father and no longer welcome at the ranch after siding with railroad men, headed by Mr. Langford (<a href="/wiki/Otto_Kruger" title="Otto Kruger">Otto Kruger</a>), against the Senator's personal interests.

She does not love him but says yes to his proposal. Before they can be married, however, Lewt picks a fight with Pierce in a saloon and guns him down. He insists that Pearl can belong only to him.  Lewt becomes a wanted man.
</p><p>On the run from the law, Lewt finds time to derail a train and occasionally drop by the ranch late at night and press his attentions on Pearl. She cannot resist her desire for him and lies for Lewt to the law, hiding him in her room.  Afterward, however, he walks out on her, despite her pleas that she loves him.
</p><p>Laura Belle's health takes a turn for the worse and the Senator admits his love for her before she dies. Jesse returns to visit but is too late; his mother is dead. The Senator continues to shun him, as does Lewt, their family feud finally resulting in a showdown. Lewt tosses a gun to his unarmed brother but Jesse stands his ground without attempting to pick it up.  Jesse warns that Lewt will eventually be hanged as a murderer, and Lewt responds by shooting Jesse.

</p><p>In 1912, <a href="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> star Don Hewes (Fred Astaire) is buying Easter presents for his sweetheart ("Happy Easter").  At one store, he must persuade a young boy to part with a cuddly Easter rabbit he wants and choose a set of drums ("Drum Crazy") instead. He takes the gifts to his dancing partner, Nadine Hale (<a href="/wiki/Ann_Miller" title="Ann Miller">Ann Miller</a>), who explains that she has been offered a show that would feature her as a solo star. He tries to get her to change her mind and it looks as if he has succeeded ("It Only Happens When I Dance With You"), until his best friend, Johnny (<a href="/wiki/Peter_Lawford" title="Peter Lawford">Peter Lawford</a>), arrives. She reveals that she and Don are no longer a team and makes it obvious that she is attracted to Johnny. She continues to pursue him, but he refuses her out of respect for Don.
</p><p>Don drowns his sorrow at a bar, where he brags that he can make a star of the next dancer he meets. He picks one of the girls performing on stage, Hannah Brown (<a href="/wiki/Judy_Garland" title="Judy Garland">Judy Garland</a>), and tells her to meet him for rehearsal the next day. He tries to turn her into a copy of Nadine, teaching her to dance the same way, buying her dresses in a similar style and giving her an "exotic" stage name, "Juanita". However, she makes several mistakes at their first performance ("Beautiful Faces Need Beautiful Clothes"), and the show is a fiasco.
</p><p>Hannah meets Johnny, who is instantly attracted to her and sings "A Fella With an Umbrella" while walking her to her rehearsal with Don. After he tries - unsuccessfully - to reunite Nadine and Don by inviting them to lunch and then leaving them alone, she tells him her friends are laughing because Hannah is trying to be her. He realizes his mistake and after hearing Hannah sing "I Love a Piano", he works out routines more suited to her personality. Now known as "Hannah &amp; Hewes", they are shown much more successfully performing "I Love a Piano," "Snookie-Ookums", "The Ragtime Violin", and "When That Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves For Alabam'".
</p><p>At an audition for <a href="/wiki/Ziegfeld_Follies" title="Ziegfeld Follies">Ziegfeld Follies</a>, Hannah and Don meet Nadine, who will star in the show. Hannah realizes that Nadine was Don's former dancing partner and demands to know if they were in love. Later, Don meets Hannah back at the hotel and reveals that he turned down the Ziegfeld offer, believing that she and Nadine do not belong in the same show. Johnny arrives to take Hannah to dinner, at which he reveals that he has fallen in love with her. While she does like him, she admits she is actually in love with Don. They continue to have a close friendship.
</p><p>Nadine's show opens ("Shakin' The Blues Away") and Don is in the audience. When he and Hannah meet the next day, he reveals he signed them to star in their own show and invites her to celebrate over dinner. She arrives at his apartment, only to have him suggest a dance rehearsal. She is upset and tells him that he doesn't see her as a woman, only a dancing aid. She tries to leave, but he stops and kisses her. She then plays the piano and sings "It Only Happens When I Dance With You," after which he realizes he is in love with her and they embrace.
</p><p>The show contains a solo by Don ("<a href="/wiki/Steppin%27_Out_with_My_Baby" title="Steppin' Out with My Baby">Steppin' Out with My Baby</a>"), followed by the best-known musical number in the film ("<a href="/wiki/We%27re_a_Couple_of_Swells" title="We're a Couple of Swells">We're a Couple of Swells</a>"), in which he and Hannah play a pair of street urchins with vivid imaginations. They go to celebrate after the show at the roof garden where Nadine is performing.  The audience gives them a rousing ovation as they arrive, much to Nadine's chagrin who hears the uproar backstage. After she dances in a number called "The Girl on the Magazine Cover," she insists that Don perform one of their old numbers with her for old times' sake - "It Only Happens When I Dance With You (Reprise)". When he reluctantly agrees, Hannah becomes upset and leaves, believing that he has only been using her to regain Nadine, and has succeeded.
</p><p>Hannah goes to the bar where she and Don first met. She pours out her troubles to Mike the bartender ("Better Luck Next Time"). When she returns to her apartment, she finds Don waiting. He tries to explain that he was forced to dance with Nadine and says he'll wait all night for her to forgive him, but just before she opens the door, he is evicted by the house detective. The next morning Hannah tells Johnny about her and Don's misunderstanding. He says if he loved someone he would let her know it. She realizes that he is right and goes to meet Don for their date at the <a href="/wiki/Easter_parade" title="Easter parade">Easter parade</a>.
</p><p>Later that morning, several gifts arrive at Don's apartment, with no cards. Hannah arrives unexpectedly saying she sent them, oblivious to the previous evening's argument and urging him to prepare for their date. As they walk in the Easter parade, photographers take their picture, echoing the film's opening with Nadine, and he proposes to her (<a href="/wiki/Easter_Parade_(song)" title="Easter Parade (song)">"Easter Parade"</a>).
</p><p>At a performance by the Ballet Lermontov at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Covent_Garden_Opera_House" title="Covent Garden Opera House">Covent Garden Opera House</a>, music student Julian is in attendance to hear the ballet score <i>Heart of Fire</i>, composed by his teacher, Professor Palmer. Separately present is Victoria 'Vicky' Page, a young, unknown dancer from an aristocratic background, with her aunt, Lady Neston. As <i>Heart of Fire</i> progresses, Julian recognises the music as one of his own compositions.
</p><p>During the performance, Professor Palmer receives an invitation to an after-ballet party at Lady Neston's residence, also asking Boris Lermontov, the company impresario, to attend. Julian leaves the performance in disillusionment at his professor's plagiarism of his music. Lermontov and Vicki meet, and he invites her to a rehearsal of the company.
</p><p>Julian has written to Lermontov to explain the circumstances behind <i>Heart of Fire</i>, but then tries to retrieve the letter. Lermontov's assistant Dimitri thwarts all attempts by Julian to gain entry to Lermontov's suite, but finally Lermontov gives Julian an audience. Julian says that he wishes to retrieve his letter before Lermontov has seen it, except that Lermontov has already read the letter.
</p><p>Lermontov asks Julian to play one of his own works at the piano. After hearing Julian play, he hires him as a <a href="/wiki/R%C3%A9p%C3%A9titeur" title="Répétiteur">répétiteur</a> for the company orchestra and assistant to the company's conductor, Livingstone Montague (known colloquially to the company as 'Livy'). Lermontov realises that Julian was the true composer of <i>Heart of Fire</i>.
</p><p>Julian and Vicky arrive for work at the Ballet Lermontov on the same day. Later, Vicky dances with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ballet_Rambert" title="Ballet Rambert">Ballet Rambert</a> in a matinee performance of <i><a href="/wiki/Swan_Lake" title="Swan Lake">Swan Lake</a></i> at the <a href="/wiki/Mercury_Theatre,_Notting_Hill_Gate" title="Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate">Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate</a>, in a production with a company led by <a href="/wiki/Marie_Rambert" title="Marie Rambert">Marie Rambert</a> (who appears in the film as herself in a wordless cameo). Watching this performance, Lermontov realises her potential and invites Vicky to go with Ballet Lermontov to Paris and <a href="/wiki/Monte_Carlo" title="Monte Carlo">Monte Carlo</a>. He decides to create a starring role for her in a new ballet, <i>The Red Shoes</i>, for which Julian is to provide the music. 
</p><p><i>The Red Shoes</i> ballet is a resounding success and Lermontov revitalizes the company's repertoire with Vicky in the lead roles and Julian tasked with composing new scores. In the meantime, Vicky and Julian have fallen in love, but keep their relationship secret from Lermontov. Lermontov begins to have personal feelings toward Vicky; he resents the romance between her and Julian after learning of it. The impresario fires Julian; Vicky leaves the company with him. They marry and live in London, where Julian works on composing a new opera.
</p><p>Some time later whilst travelling, Vicky receives a visit from Lermontov, who convinces her to return to the company to dance a revival of <i>The Red Shoes</i>. On opening night, Julian appears in her dressing room; he has left the première of his opera at <a href="/wiki/Royal_Opera_House" title="Royal Opera House">Covent Garden</a> to find her and take her back. Lermontov arrives; he and Julian contend for Vicky's affections, each one arguing that her true destiny is with him only. Torn between her love for Julian and her need to dance, she eventually chooses the latter.
</p><p>Julian, realising that he has lost her, leaves for the railway station; Lermontov consoles Vicky and tries to turn her attention to the evening's performance. Vicky is escorted to the stage wearing the red shoes and, seemingly under their influence, turns and runs from the theatre. Julian, on the platform of the railway station, runs towards her. Vicky jumps from a balcony and falls in front of an approaching train.
</p><p>When Vicki jumps, she is wearing the red shoes which we saw her wearing as she is preparing in her dressing room, despite the fact that in the performance her character does not put them on until part way through the ballet. Powell and Pressburger themselves discussed this situation <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-ALIM_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-ALIM-5">[5]</a></sup> and it has been much discussed since. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> Powell decided that it was artistically "right" for Vicky to be wearing the red shoes at that point because if she is not wearing them, it takes away the ambiguity over why she died. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-ALIM_5-1"><a href="#cite_note-ALIM-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>Shaken, Lermontov appears before the audience to announce that, "Miss Page is unable to dance tonight – nor indeed any other night". As a mark of respect, the company performs <i>The Red Shoes</i> with a spotlight on the empty space where Vicky would have been.
</p><p>While lying close to death on a stretcher, Vicky asks Julian to remove the red shoes, just as at the end of <i>The Red Shoes</i> ballet.
</p><p>Virginia Cunningham (Olivia de Havilland) is an apparently schizophrenic inmate at a mental institution called the Juniper Hill State Hospital (which treats only female patients). She <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations" title="Auditory hallucinations">hears voices</a> and seems so <a href="/wiki/Psychosis" title="Psychosis">out of touch with reality</a> that she doesn’t recognize her husband Robert (Mark Stevens).
</p><p>Dr. Kik (Leo Genn; as Mark Van <i>K</i>ensdelaer<i>ik</i>, MD/"Dr. Kik") works with her, and flashbacks show how Virginia and Robert met a few years earlier in Chicago. He worked for a publisher who rejected her writing, and they bumped into each other again in the cafeteria. Occasionally she continued to drop by the cafeteria so they get to know each other.
</p><p>Despite their blossoming romance, Virginia abruptly leaves town without explanation. Robert moves to New York and bumps into her again at the Philharmonic. After she provides a flimsy excuse for her absence and departure, they pick up where they left off, though she remains evasive and avoids his desire for marriage. Eventually, Virginia brings up the possibility of marriage. They marry on May 7, but Virginia acts erratically again. She can’t sleep and loses touch with reality, as she feels it is November and snaps when Robert corrects her. The rest of the film follows her therapy. Dr. Kik puts her through <a href="/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy" title="Electroconvulsive therapy">electro-shock treatment</a> and other forms of treatment including <a href="/wiki/Hypnotherapy" title="Hypnotherapy">hypnotherapy</a>. Dr. Kik wants to get to the "causes of her unconscious rejection."  The film includes many flashbacks, including her earlier failed engagement to Gordon (<a href="/wiki/Leif_Erickson_(actor)" title="Leif Erickson (actor)">Leif Erickson</a>) as well as childhood issues. The film shows her progress and what happens to her along the way.
</p><p>The mental hospital is organized on a spectrum of "levels." The better a patient gets, the lower level she is able to achieve. Virginia moves to the lowest level (One), where she encounters Nurse Davis (Helen Craig), the only truly abusive nurse in the hospital. Davis is jealous of Dr. Kik's interest in Virginia, which she sees as excessive. Nurse Davis goads Virginia into an outburst which results in Virginia being <a href="/wiki/Straitjacket" title="Straitjacket">straitjacketed</a> and expelled from Level One into the "snake pit," where patients considered beyond help are simply placed together in a large padded cell and abandoned. Dr. Kik, learning of this, has Virginia returned to Level One, but away from Nurse Davis's care.
</p><p>Despite this setback, Dr. Kik's care continues to improve Virginia's mental state. Over time, Virginia gains insight and self-understanding, and is able to leave the hospital.
</p><p>The film also depicts the bureaucratic regimentation of the institution, the staff — some unkind and aloof, some kind and empathetic; and relationships between patients, from which Virginia learns as much as she does in therapy.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Samson" title="Samson">Samson</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Tribe_of_Dan" title="Tribe of Dan">Danite</a> Hebrew placed under <a href="/wiki/Nazirite" title="Nazirite">Nazirite</a> vows from birth by his mother <a href="/wiki/Hazelelponi" title="Hazelelponi">Hazelelponit</a>, is engaged to a <a href="/wiki/Philistines" title="Philistines">Philistine</a> woman named Semadar. At their wedding feast, Samson loses a bet with his wedding guests because of Semadar and attacks 30 Philistines to strip them of their cloaks to pay his betting debt. After paying his debt, Samson searches for Semadar, only to learn that her father Tubal married her to a Philistine once Samson left the wedding to pay his debt. A fight breaks out between Samson and the Philistines, which results in the death of Semadar and Tubal. Samson becomes a hunted man, and in his fury he begins fighting the Philistines. The Saran of Gaza imposes heavy taxes on the Danites, with the purpose of having Samson betrayed by his own people. The Saran's plan works, and frustrated Danites hand over Samson to the Philistines, much to the joy of <a href="/wiki/Delilah" title="Delilah">Delilah</a>, Semadar's younger sister. Samson is taken by Prince Ahtur, the military governor of the land of Dan, and a regiment of Philistine troops. En route back to Gaza, Ahtur decides to taunt Samson. Samson rips apart his chains and ropes and begins to combat the Philistines, toppling Ahtur's war chariot and using the jawbone of an ass to club the Philistine soldiers to death.
</p><p>News of the defeat of Ahtur at the hands of Samson reaches the Saran. The Saran ponders how to defeat Samson. Delilah comes up with the idea of seducing Samson, thus having him reveal the secret of his strength and then deliver him for punishment. Her plan works; she cuts his hair, which he feels gives him his strength. To fully neutralize him, Samson is blinded by his captors and put to slave work, and is eventually brought to the temple of <a href="/wiki/Dagon" title="Dagon">Dagon</a> for the entertainment of the Philistines and the Saran. However, Delilah has been in love with Samson ever since his engagement with Semadar, and his blindness and torture make her feel deep remorse over her betrayal. She initially had betrayed him because she wanted to avenge the deaths of her father and sister, which she thought were caused "because of Samson."
</p><p>Delilah later attends the public torture of Samson wielding a whip which he uses to be guided by her to the temple of Dagon's main support pillars. Once he stands between them, he tells Delilah to flee, but she remains, unseen by him, as he pushes the pillars apart. The pillars give way and the temple collapses, burying Samson, Delilah, and all the Philistines inside alive, including the court. In the end, the temple lies in rubble, and Saul and Miriam, his two closest Danite Hebrew friends, are left to mourn Samson's passing.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Cinderella_(Disney_character)" title="Cinderella (Disney character)">Cinderella</a> is living a dissatisfying life, having lost both parents at a young age, and being forced to work as a scullery maid in her own <a href="/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau" title="Château">château</a>. Her stepmother, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lady_Tremaine" title="Lady Tremaine">Lady Tremaine</a>, is cruel to her, and she is jealous of Cinderella's beauty. Additionally her two stepsisters <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Drizella_Tremaine" title="Drizella Tremaine">Drizella</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anastasia_Tremaine" title="Anastasia Tremaine">Anastasia</a>, cruelly take advantage of her. In spite of this, Cinderella is a kind and gentle young woman. She is friends with mice and kind to birds that live in and around the château. Meanwhile, at the royal palace, the King is frustrated that his son, the Prince, still refuses to marry. He and the Grand Duke organize a ball in an effort to find a suitable wife for the Prince, requesting every eligible maiden attend. Upon receiving notice of the ball, Lady Tremaine agrees to let Cinderella go if she finishes her chores and can find a suitable dress to wear.
</p><p>Cinderella finds a gown that belonged to her mother and decides to refashion it for the ball, but her stepfamily impedes this by giving her extra chores. Cinderella's animal friends, including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jaq_and_Gus" title="Jaq and Gus">Jaq and Gus</a>, refashion it for her, completing the design with a necklace and sash discarded by Drizella and Anastasia, respectively. When Cinderella comes downstairs wearing the dress, the stepsisters are upset when they realize Cinderella is wearing their accessories, and tear the dress to shreds before leaving for the ball with their mother. Heartbroken, Cinderella storms out into the garden in tears, where her <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fairy_Godmother_(Disney)" title="Fairy Godmother (Disney)">Fairy Godmother</a> appears before her. Insisting that Cinderella will go to the ball, the Fairy Godmother magically transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, the mice into horses, Cinderella's horse, Major, into a coachman, and dog, Bruno, into a footman, before turning Cinderella's ruined dress into a shimmering blue ballgown and her shoes into glass slippers. As Cinderella leaves for the ball, the Fairy Godmother warns her the spell will break at the stroke of midnight.
</p><p>At the ball, the Prince rejects every girl until he sees Cinderella, who agrees to dance with him, unaware of who he is. The two fall in love and go out for a stroll together in the castle gardens. As they are about to kiss, Cinderella hears the clock start to chime midnight and flees. As she leaves the castle, one of her slippers falls off. The palace guards give chase as Cinderella flees in the coach before the spell breaks on the last stroke of midnight. Cinderella, her pets, and the mice hide in a wooded area as the guards pass.
</p><p>The Grand Duke informs the King that Cinderella, who remains anonymous, has escaped, and that the Prince wishes to marry her. The lost glass slipper is the only piece of evidence. The King issues a royal proclamation ordering every maiden in the kingdom to try on the slipper for size in an effort to find the girl. After this news reaches Cinderella's household, Lady Tremaine overhears Cinderella humming the waltz played at the ball. Realizing that Cinderella is the mysterious girl, Lady Tremaine locks her in her attic bedroom. Later, the Duke arrives at the château, and Jaq and Gus steal the key from Lady Tremaine's dress pocket and take it up to the attic as Anastasia and Drizella unsuccessfully try on the slipper. Lady Tremaine's cat, Lucifer, ambushes the mice, but Bruno chases him out of the house, allowing the mice to free Cinderella. As the Duke is about to leave, Cinderella appears and asks to try on the slipper. Knowing it will fit, Lady Tremaine trips the footman as he brings the Duke the slipper, causing it to shatter on the floor. Much to her horror, Cinderella presents the Duke with the other slipper, which fits perfectly. The film ends with a now-married Prince and Cinderella at their wedding, sharing a kiss as they leave.

They have a copy of the map he used. A tall, mysterious native, Umbopa (Siriaque), joins the <a href="/wiki/Safari" title="Safari">safari</a>. Allan has no use for women on a safari, but during the long and grueling journey, he and  Elizabeth begin to fall in love.
</p><p>The party encounters Van Brun (<a href="/wiki/Hugo_Haas" title="Hugo Haas">Hugo Haas</a>), a lone white man living with a tribe. They learn that he met Curtis. However, when Allan recognizes him as a fugitive who cannot afford to let them go, they take him hostage to leave the village safely. Van Brun tries to shoot Allan, killing his faithful right-hand man Khiva (Kimursi), instead. Allan dispatches Van Brun and the party flees from the angry villagers.
</p><p>When they finally reach the region where the mines are supposed to be, they are met by people who resemble Umbopa. They discover that their companion is royalty; he has returned to attempt to dethrone the evil King Twala (Baziga). Umbopa leaves with his supporters, while Allan, Elizabeth and John travel to a tense meeting with Twala. With his last rifle bullet, John kills a would-be attacker, temporarily quelling the natives.
</p><p>The king's advisor, Gagool (Sekaryongo), communicates that they have seen Curtis and leads them to a cave that contains a trove of jewels and in which they find the skeletal remains of Elizabeth's husband. While they are distracted by this discovery, Gagool sneaks away and triggers a booby trap that seals them inside the cave. Leaving the jewels behind, they find a way out through an underground stream and return to the settlement, just as Umbopa and his followers arrive.
</p><p>Umbopa's people have an unusual method of deciding the kingship. The two claimants duel to the death. Despite cheating by one of Twala's men, Umbopa wins. Afterwards, he provides an escort for his friends' return trip.
</p><p>The story, set in <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">ancient Rome</a> during the final years of Emperor <a href="/wiki/Nero" title="Nero">Nero</a>'s reign, 64–68 AD, combines both historical and fictional events and characters, and compresses the key events of that period into the space of only a few weeks. Its main theme is the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>’s conflict with <a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and persecution of Christians in the final years of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Julio-Claudian" title="Julio-Claudian">Julio-Claudian</a> line. Unlike his illustrious and powerful predecessor, Emperor <a href="/wiki/Claudius" title="Claudius">Claudius</a>, Nero proved corrupt and destructive, and his actions eventually threatened to destroy Rome's previously peaceful social order. 
</p><p>Marcus Vinicius (<a href="/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(actor)" title="Robert Taylor (actor)">Robert Taylor</a>) is a Roman military commander and the <a href="/wiki/Legatus" title="Legatus">legate</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Legio_XIV_Gemina" title="Legio XIV Gemina">XIV Gemina</a>. Returning from wars in Britain and Gaul, he falls in love with Lygia (<a href="/wiki/Deborah_Kerr" title="Deborah Kerr">Deborah Kerr</a>), a devout Christian, and as a result he finds himself increasingly drawn to her religion. Though she grew up as the foster daughter of <a href="/wiki/Aulus_Plautius" title="Aulus Plautius">Aulus Plautius</a> (<a href="/wiki/Felix_Aylmer" title="Felix Aylmer">Felix Aylmer</a>), a retired Roman general, Lygia is legally a hostage of Rome. <a href="/wiki/Petronius" title="Petronius">Petronius</a> (<a href="/wiki/Leo_Genn" title="Leo Genn">Leo Genn</a>), Marcus' uncle, persuades Nero (<a href="/wiki/Peter_Ustinov" title="Peter Ustinov">Peter Ustinov</a>) to give her to his nephew as a reward for  his services. Lygia resents this arrangement, but cannot resist falling in love with Marcus.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Nero's atrocities become increasingly outrageous and his behavior more irrational. After Nero <a href="/wiki/Great_Fire_of_Rome" title="Great Fire of Rome">burns Rome</a> and blames the Christians, Marcus sets out to rescue Lygia and her family. Nero arrests them, along with all the  other Christians, and condemns them to be slaughtered in his Circus: some are killed by lions. Petronius, Nero's most trusted advisor, warns him that the Christians will be celebrated as martyrs, but he cannot change the emperor's mind. Then, tired of Nero's insanity and suspecting that he may be about to turn on him too, Petronius composes a letter to Nero expressing his derision for the emperor (which he previously had concealed to avoid being murdered by him) and commits suicide by severing an artery in his wrist. The Christian apostle <a href="/wiki/Saint_Peter" title="Saint Peter">Peter</a> (<a href="/wiki/Finlay_Currie" title="Finlay Currie">Finlay Currie</a>) has also been arrested after returning to Rome in response to a sign from the Lord, and he marries Marcus and Lygia in the Circus prisons. Peter is later <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cross_of_St._Peter" title="Cross of St. Peter">crucified upside-down</a>, a form of execution conceived by Nero's Praetorian Guard as an expression of mockery.
</p><p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Poppaea" title="Poppaea">Poppaea</a> (<a href="/wiki/Patricia_Laffan" title="Patricia Laffan">Patricia Laffan</a>), Nero's wife, who lusts after Marcus, devises a diabolical revenge for his rejection of her. Lygia is tied to a stake in the Circus and a wild bull is released into the arena. Lygia's bodyguard Ursus (<a href="/wiki/Buddy_Baer" title="Buddy Baer">Buddy Baer</a>) must attempt to kill the bull with his bare hands to save Lygia from being gored to death. Marcus is taken to the emperor's box and forced to watch, to the outrage of his officers, who are among the spectators. But Ursus is able to topple the bull and break its neck. Massively impressed by Ursus's victory, the crowd exhorts Nero to spare the couple. He refuses to do so, even after four of his courtiers, <a href="/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger" title="Seneca the Younger">Seneca</a> (<a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Hannen_(actor)" title="Nicholas Hannen (actor)">Nicholas Hannen</a>), architect <a href="/wiki/Phaon_(freedman)" title="Phaon (freedman)">Phaon</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/D.A._Clarke-Smith" title="D.A.

Clarke-Smith</a>), poet <a href="/wiki/Lucan" title="Lucan">Lucan</a> (Alfredo Varelli), and musician Terpnos (Geoffrey Dunn) add their endorsement of the mob's demands by putting their thumbs up as well. Marcus then breaks free of his bonds, leaps into the arena, and frees Lygia with the help of the loyal troops from his own legion. Marcus accuses Nero of burning Rome and announces that General <a href="/wiki/Galba" title="Galba">Galba</a> is at that moment marching on the city, intent on replacing Nero, and hails him as new Emperor of Rome.
</p><p>The crowd revolts, now firmly believing that Nero, not the Christians, is responsible for the burning of Rome. Nero flees to his palace, where he strangles Poppaea, blaming her for inciting him to <a href="/wiki/Scapegoat" title="Scapegoat">scapegoat</a> the Christians. Then <a href="/wiki/Claudia_Acte" title="Claudia Acte">Acte</a> (<a href="/wiki/Rosalie_Crutchley" title="Rosalie Crutchley">Rosalie Crutchley</a>), Nero's discarded mistress who is still in love with him, appears and offers him a dagger to end his own life before the mob storming the palace kills him. Nero cannot do it, so Acte helps him to push the dagger into his chest, and he dies.
</p><p>Marcus, Lygia and Ursus are now free, and they leave Rome for Marcus' estate in Sicily. By the roadside, Peter's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crozier" title="Crozier">crook</a>, which he had left behind when he returned to Rome, has sprouted blossoms. A radiant light appears and a chorus intones, "I am the way, the truth, and the life," words reported to have been spoken by Jesus (<a href="/wiki/Gospel_of_John" title="Gospel of John">John</a> 14:6, <a href="/wiki/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>).
</p><p>The film begins in black-and-white and in standard 4:3 aspect ratio, as travel writer and newscaster <a href="/wiki/Lowell_Thomas" title="Lowell Thomas">Lowell Thomas</a> appears on screen to discuss the evolution of motion picture entertainment, from the earliest cave paintings designed to suggest movement, up to the introduction of color and sound.

Tinker Bell, who is very jealous of Pan's attention to Wendy, persuades the <a href="/wiki/Lost_Boys_(Peter_Pan)" title="Lost Boys (Peter Pan)">Lost Boys</a> that Pan has ordered them to shoot down Wendy, which Tink refers to as a "Wendy bird". Tinker Bell's treachery is soon found out, and Peter <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Banishment" title="Banishment">banishes</a> her. John and Michael set off with the Lost Boys to find the island's <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples" title="Indigenous peoples">Indians</a>, who instead capture them, believing them to be the ones responsible for taking the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Leader" title="Leader">chief</a>'s daughter, <a href="/wiki/Tiger_Lily_(Peter_Pan)" title="Tiger Lily (Peter Pan)">Tiger Lily</a>.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Peter takes Wendy to see the <a href="/wiki/Mermaid" title="Mermaid">mermaids</a>. The mischievous mermaids delight in tormenting Wendy, but flee in terror at the sight of Hook. Peter and Wendy see that Hook and Smee have captured Tiger Lily so that they might persuade her to disclose Peter's hideout. Peter and Wendy free her, and Peter is honored by the tribe. Hook then plots to take advantage of Tinker Bell's jealousy of Wendy, tricking her into revealing the location of Peter's lair. Wendy and her brothers eventually grow homesick and plan to return home. They invite Peter and the Lost Boys to return to London and be adopted by the Darling parents. The Lost Boys agree, but Peter is so set against growing up that he refuses, presumptuously thinking that they will all return shortly. The pirates lie in wait and capture the Lost Boys and the Darlings as they exit, leaving behind a <a href="/wiki/Time_bomb" title="Time bomb">time bomb</a> to kill Peter. Tinker Bell learns of the plot just in time to snatch the bomb from Peter as it explodes.
</p><p>Peter rescues Tinker Bell from the rubble and together they confront the pirates, releasing the children before they can <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Walk_the_plank" title="Walk the plank">walk the plank</a>. Peter engages Hook in single combat as the children fight off the crew, and succeeds in humiliating the captain. Hook and his crew flee, with the crocodile in hot pursuit. Peter gallantly commandeers the deserted ship, and assisted by Tinker Bell's pixie dust, flies it to London with the children aboard. However, the Lost Boys decide to return to Never Land rather than be adopted in London. George and Mary Darling return home from the party to find Wendy not in her bed, but sleeping at the open window. Wendy awakens and excitedly tells about their adventures. The parents look out the window and see what appears to be a pirate ship in the clouds. George, who has softened his position about Wendy staying in the nursery, recognizes the ship from his own childhood.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Ancient Rome</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Iudaea_Province" title="Iudaea Province">Judaea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Capri" title="Capri">Capri</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Galilee" title="Galilee">Galilee</a> (in the time period stretching from 32 to 38 AD.), Diana (<a href="/wiki/Jean_Simmons" title="Jean Simmons">Jean Simmons</a>) tells Emperor Caligula that she has not heard from Marcellus Gallio (<a href="/wiki/Richard_Burton" title="Richard Burton">Richard Burton</a>) for almost a year, when Marcellus was in Cana of Galilee. At that time, Marcellus was told by Paulus that Caligula had become the emperor.
</p><p>Marcellus Gallio, son of an important Roman senator (<a href="/wiki/Torin_Thatcher" title="Torin Thatcher">Torin Thatcher</a>), and himself a <a href="/wiki/Military_tribune" title="Military tribune">military tribune</a>, introduces through flashback narration, the might and scope of the Roman empire. Marcellus is notoriously known as a ladies’ man, but is captivated by the reappearance of his childhood sweetheart, Diana, ward of the Emperor Tiberius. Diana is unofficially pledged in marriage to Tiberius's regent, Caligula.
</p><p>In a slave market Marcellus bids against Caligula for a defiant Greek slave, Demetrius (<a href="/wiki/Victor_Mature" title="Victor Mature">Victor Mature</a>), and wins. Angrily, Caligula issues orders for Marcellus to receive a military transfer to <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> in <a href="/wiki/Palestine_(region)" title="Palestine (region)">Palestine</a>.
</p><p>Marcellus has Demetrius released and orders him to go on his own to the Gallio home. Marcellus is surprised to find Demetrius waiting for him when he arrives. Unofficially, Marcellus had freed Demetrius, but Demetrius feels honor bound to compensate Marcellus by being his servant. Demetrius accompanies Marcellus to Palestine but, before the <a href="/wiki/Galley" title="Galley">galley</a> sails, Diana comes to see Marcellus, pledging her love for him and her intention to intercede on his behalf with Tiberius. Marcellus declares his love for Diana and asks her to make the emperor promise not to give her in marriage to Caligula.
</p><p>Marcellus rides into Jerusalem with the <a href="/wiki/Centurion" title="Centurion">centurion</a> Paulus (<a href="/wiki/Jeff_Morrow" title="Jeff Morrow">Jeff Morrow</a>) on the same day as Jesus's triumphal entry on <a href="/wiki/Palm_Sunday" title="Palm Sunday">Palm Sunday</a>. Demetrius locks eyes with Jesus and feels compelled to follow him.
</p><p>Jesus is arrested and condemned by <a href="/wiki/Pontius_Pilate" title="Pontius Pilate">Pontius Pilate</a> (<a href="/wiki/Richard_Boone" title="Richard Boone">Richard Boone</a>), the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Procurator_(Roman)" title="Procurator (Roman)">procurator</a>. Marcellus reports to Pilate, who informs him that the emperor has sent for him. Before Marcellus departs, he is ordered to take charge of the detail of Roman soldiers assigned to crucify Jesus. Marcellus wins the robe worn by Jesus in a dice game and is told it will be a reminder of Marcellus's first crucifixion.
</p><p>Returning from the crucifixion with Demetrius, Marcellus uses the robe in an attempt to shield himself from a rain squall, but feels a sudden crushing guilt for crucifying Jesus and tears the robe off. In a fit of rage, Demetrius curses Marcellus and the Roman Empire and runs away, taking the robe with him. Marcellus now behaves like a madman haunted by nightmares of the crucifixion. He reports to Emperor Tiberius at <a href="/wiki/Capri" title="Capri">Capri</a>, who gives him an imperial commission to find and destroy the robe, while gathering a list of names of Jesus' followers. At Diana's request, Tiberius leaves her free to marry Marcellus, though Tiberius believes Marcellus is mad.
</p><p>Marcellus travels to Palestine, seeking to ingratiate himself with Justus (<a href="/wiki/Dean_Jagger" title="Dean Jagger">Dean Jagger</a>), a weaver in Cana, and the Christian community that he leads. He sees examples of Christian life in Justus's miraculously healed grandson and in the paralytic Miriam.
</p><p>Marcellus finds Demetrius alone in an inn and demands that he destroy the robe, believing it has cursed him into madness. Demetrius tells him the robe has no real power, that it only reminds Marcellus of what he did, and it is his guilt over the killing of an innocent man that has caused him to become so troubled.
</p><p>Demetrius gives the robe to Marcellus, who refuses to touch it. He is terrified, but as the robe touches him, he is relieved from the burden and becomes a Christian.
</p><p>Justus calls the villagers together and begins to introduce <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Simon_Peter" title="Simon Peter">Peter</a>, when he is killed by an arrow from a detachment of Roman soldiers. Marcellus intervenes and Paulus informs him that his orders are no longer valid; Tiberius is dead, and Caligula is emperor. Marcellus informs Paulus that an imperial commission is valid until specifically countermanded by the new emperor. Paulus tells Marcellus to make him obey via a sword duel. After a prolonged struggle, Marcellus prevails. Rather than killing Paulus, Marcellus hurls his sword into a tree. Paulus, humiliated by his defeat, orders the soldiers to leave.
</p><p>Peter invites Marcellus to join Demetrius and him as missionaries. Marcellus hesitates, out of guilt; but when Peter tells him of his own denial of Jesus, Marcellus confesses his role in Jesus' death. Peter points out to him that Jesus forgave him from the cross, and Marcellus pledges his life to Jesus and agrees to go with them. Their missionary journey takes them to Rome, where they must proceed "under cover" as Caligula has proscribed them.
</p><p>From Rome, Caligula summons Diana from her retreat at the Gallio home, to tell her that Marcellus has become a traitor to Rome by becoming a Christian. He takes her to the guard room where a captured Demetrius is being tortured. Diana runs out of the palace to Marcipor (<a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=David_Leonard_(actor)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="David Leonard (actor) (page does not exist)">David Leonard</a>), the Gallio family slave, who is secretly Christian. Diana guesses that he is a Christian and has seen Marcellus, and so she gets Marcipor to take her to see him.
</p><p>Marcellus and Diana are reunited, and Marcellus tells her the story of the robe and his Christian conversion. Diana helps Marcellus rescue Demetrius.
</p><p>Peter comes to Gallio, where Demetrius has been taken, and heals him. Caligula issues orders to bring Marcellus to him alive to stand trial by the end of the day.
</p><p>After witnessing Peter's healing of Demetrius, the physician attending Demetrius goes to denounce them to the authorities. Marcellus' father disowns him as an enemy of Rome. Marcellus flees with Demetrius, but when Marcellus gives himself up so that Demetrius can escape, he is captured and put on trial.
</p><p>Caligula makes Diana sit next to him for Marcellus's trial. Marcellus admits to being a Christian; however, he denies the charge that Christians are plotting against the state. Marcellus tries to show Caligula his opportunity to accept Christ as he tries to hand the robe to Caligula, but Caligula refuses to touch it, as he considers it to be "bewitched".
</p><p>Caligula condemns Marcellus to death by the wish of the members of the audience, based on what they have heard.  Diana then accepts Christ and seeks to join Marcellus, the man she considers to be her husband, in <a href="/wiki/Heaven" title="Heaven">His Kingdom</a> (Heaven). She also denounces Caligula as an insane, tyrannical monster.
</p><p>Caligula condemns Diana to die alongside Marcellus. As they depart the audience hall for their execution, Marcellus is acknowledged by his repentant father, and Diana gives the robe to Marcipor.
</p><p>Recuperating from a broken leg, adventuresome professional photographer L. B. "Jeff" Jefferies (Stewart) is confined to a wheelchair in his <a href="/wiki/Greenwich_Village" title="Greenwich Village">Greenwich Village</a> apartment. His rear window looks out onto a courtyard and several other apartments. During a powerful <a href="/wiki/Heat_wave" title="Heat wave">heat wave</a>, he watches his neighbors, who keep their windows open to stay cool.
</p><p>He observes a flamboyant dancer he nicknames "Miss Torso"; a single middle-aged woman he calls "Miss Lonelyhearts"; a talented, single, middle-aged composer-pianist; several married couples; a female sculptor; and Lars Thorwald (Burr), a traveling jewelry salesman with a bedridden wife.
</p><p>Jeff's sophisticated, beautiful <a href="/wiki/Socialite" title="Socialite">socialite</a> girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), visits him regularly, as does his insurance company's nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter). Stella wants Jeff to settle down and marry Lisa, but Jeff is reluctant.
</p><p>One night during a thunderstorm, Jeff hears a woman scream "Don't!" and then the sound of breaking glass. Later, he is awakened by thunder and observes Thorwald leaving his apartment. Thorwald makes repeated late-night trips carrying his sample case. The next morning, Jeff notices that Thorwald's wife is gone, and then sees Thorwald cleaning a large knife and handsaw. Later, Thorwald ties a large trunk with heavy rope and has moving men haul it away. Jeff discusses all this with Lisa and with Stella.
</p><p>Jeff becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife. Jeff explains this to his friend Tom Doyle (<a href="/wiki/Wendell_Corey" title="Wendell Corey">Wendell Corey</a>), a <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department" title="New York City Police Department">New York City Police</a> detective, and asks him to do some research. Doyle finds nothing suspicious; apparently, Mrs. Thorwald is upstate, and picked up the trunk herself.
</p><p>Soon after, a neighbor's dog is found dead with its neck broken. The dog's owner yells across the courtyard, complaining of her neighbors' callous disregard of others. All the neighbors run to their windows to see what is happening, except for Thorwald, whose cigar can be seen glowing as he sits quietly in his dark apartment.
</p><p>Certain that Thorwald is also guilty of killing the dog, Jeff asks Lisa to slip an accusatory note under his door, so Jeff can watch his reaction when he reads it. Then, as a pretext to get Thorwald out of his apartment, Jeff telephones him and arranges a meeting at a bar. He believes Thorwald buried something incriminating in the courtyard flower bed, and killed the dog to stop it digging there, so when Thorwald leaves, Lisa and Stella dig up the flowers; they find nothing.
</p><p>Much to Jeff's amazement and admiration, Lisa then climbs the fire escape to Thorwald's apartment and clambers in through an open window. When Thorwald returns and grabs Lisa, Jeff calls the police, who arrive in time to save her by arresting her. Jeff sees Lisa has her hands behind her back, wiggling her finger with Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring on it. Thorwald notices this, and, realizing that she is signaling to someone, he sees Jeff across the courtyard.
</p><p>Jeff phones Doyle and leaves an urgent message. Stella heads for the police station to post bail for Lisa. When his phone rings, Jeff assumes it is Doyle, and says that the suspect has left the apartment. When no one answers, Jeff realizes that Thorwald himself had called, and is heading over to confront him. When Thorwald enters, Jeff repeatedly sets off his camera flashbulbs, temporarily blinding him. However, Thorwald grabs Jeff and manages to push him out of the open window, as Jeff is yelling for help. Police officers enter the apartment as he falls to the ground; other officers have run over to break his fall. Thorwald confesses to the police soon afterward.
</p><p>A few days later, the heat has lifted, and Jeff rests peacefully in his wheelchair, now with casts on both legs. The lonely neighbor is chatting with the pianist in his apartment, the dancer's lover returns home from the army, the couple whose dog was killed have a new dog, and the newly married couple are bickering.
</p><p>Lisa reclines on the daybed in Jeff's apartment, wearing jeans and apparently reading a book titled <i>Beyond the High Himalayas</i>. As soon as Jeff falls asleep, Lisa puts the book down and happily opens a fashion magazine.
</p><p>On <a href="/wiki/Christmas_Eve" title="Christmas Eve">Christmas Eve</a>, 1944, somewhere in Europe, two <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Army" title="U.S. Army">U.S. Army</a> soldiers, one a <a href="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> entertainer, Captain Bob Wallace (<a href="/wiki/Bing_Crosby" title="Bing Crosby">Bing Crosby</a>), the other an aspiring entertainer, Private First Class Phil Davis (<a href="/wiki/Danny_Kaye" title="Danny Kaye">Danny Kaye</a>), perform for the 151st Division ("White Christmas"). But, word has come down that their beloved commanding officer, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Major_General_(United_States)" title="Major General (United States)">Major General</a> Thomas F. Waverly (<a href="/wiki/Dean_Jagger" title="Dean Jagger">Dean Jagger</a>), is being relieved of his command. He arrives for the end of the show and delivers an emotional farewell. The men give him a rousing send-off ("The Old Man").
</p><p>At the end of the performance, everyone is forced to take cover from an aerial bombing run. One bomb knocks over a partially-destroyed building, but Bob is too busy shouting orders to notice. Phil throws him out of the way and his arm is injured by debris. Bob later visits Phil at a field hospital and thanks the private for saving his life. When Bob offers a favor to repay the debt, Phil shows him a duet he wrote and asks to perform with Bob back in New York City. Feeling obligated by Phil's heroism, Bob agrees.
</p><p>After the war, Bob and Phil make it big in nightclubs, radio, and then on Broadway, eventually becoming successful producers ("Hi Hup", "Heat Wave", "Blue Skies"). They mount their newest hit musical titled <i>Playing Around</i>. The same day they receive a letter from "Freckle-Faced Haynes, the dog-faced boy," their mess sergeant from the war, asking them to look at an act that his two sisters are doing.
</p><p>When they go to the club to watch the act ("Sisters"), Phil notices that Bob is smitten with Betty (<a href="/wiki/Rosemary_Clooney" title="Rosemary Clooney">Rosemary Clooney</a>). Phil has eyes for her sister, Judy (<a href="/wiki/Vera-Ellen" title="Vera-Ellen">Vera-Ellen</a>). Betty and Judy join Bob and Phil at their table, and Phil dances with Judy, so that Bob and Betty can get to know each other. Phil and Judy hit it off ("The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"). Bob and Betty do not, getting into a minor argument about how Bob thinks that everyone has an angle in show business.
</p><p>Judy and Betty are headed for the Columbia Inn in Pine Tree, Vermont, where they are booked to perform over the holidays. Due to a disagreement with their landlord (he claimed that they had burned an expensive rug at his hotel and had even summoned the sheriff to arrest them), the girls have to leave immediately, so Phil gives the sisters his and Bob's sleeping-room accommodations aboard the train and delays the sheriff by imitating the girls' signature number ("Sisters" redux). Bob and Phil board later and Bob is extremely upset that they have to stay up all night in the club car on their way to NYC. They are joined by Betty and Judy, who thank them profusely for the tickets and convince them to come with them to Pine Tree ("Snow").
</p><p>When the train arrives in Pine Tree, there's not a snowflake in sight, and chances of it falling appear dim. Bob and Phil discover that the inn is run by their former commanding officer, General Waverly. Waverly has invested all of his savings into the lodge, which is in danger of failing because there's no snow and thus no guests. To bring business to the inn, Bob and Phil bring the entire cast and crew of their musical <i>Playing Around</i>, and add in Betty and Judy to the rehearsals ("Minstrel Number"). Bob and Betty's relationship blooms ("Count Your Blessings") and they spend a good deal of time together. Meanwhile, Bob discovers the General's request to rejoin the army has been rejected. He decides to prove to the General that he isn't forgotten.
</p><p>While rehearsals continue ("Choreography") Bob calls Ed Harrison (<a href="/wiki/Johnny_Grant_(radio_personality)" title="Johnny Grant (radio personality)">Johnny Grant</a>), an old army buddy, now a successful variety show host, to arrange a televised invitation to all the men formerly under the command of the General to come to the inn on Christmas Eve as a surprise. In response, Harrison suggests they go all out and put the show on national television to generate free advertising for Wallace and Davis, but Bob insists that it will have nothing to do with their business. Unbeknownst to Bob, nosy housekeeper Emma Allen (<a href="/wiki/Mary_Wickes" title="Mary Wickes">Mary Wickes</a>) has been eavesdropping, but she has only heard the part about free advertising, not Bob's rejection of the idea.
</p><p>Mistakenly believing that her beloved boss will be portrayed as a pitiable figure in a nationwide broadcast, Emma reveals what she has heard to a shocked Betty. The misunderstanding causes Betty to grow suddenly cold towards a baffled Bob. While this is happening, Judy becomes convinced that Betty will never take on a serious relationship until Judy is engaged or married. She pressures a reluctant Phil to announce a phony engagement, but the plan backfires when Betty abruptly departs for New York City to take a job offer since Judy is taken care of.
</p><p>After rehearsals are complete ("Abraham Number"), Phil and Judy reveal to Bob that the engagement was phony. Bob, still unaware of the real reason behind Betty's coldness, goes to New York for <i>The Ed Harrison Show</i>, but decides to stop and try to convince Betty to come back. Bob sees Betty's new act ("Love, You Didn't Do Right by Me") and reveals the truth about the engagement, and Betty starts to warm up to him, but he is called away by Ed Harrison before learning what is really bothering her. Back at the Inn, Phil fakes an injury to distract the General so he won't see the broadcast of Bob's announcement.
</p><p>On the broadcast, Bob invites veterans of the 151st Division to come to Pine Tree, Vermont, on Christmas Eve ("What Can You Do with a General"). Betty catches Bob's televised pitch and realizes she was mistaken. She returns to Pine Tree in time for the Christmas Eve show, but only tells Judy. The whole division comes into Pine Tree secretly. When the General enters the lodge, he is greeted by his former division, who sing a rousing chorus of "The Old Man." Just as the following number ("Gee, I Wish I Was Back in the Army") ends, he learns that snow is finally falling.
</p><p>In the finale, Bob and Betty declare their love for one another, as do Phil and Judy. The background of the set is removed to show the snow falling, and Bob, Betty, Phil and Judy perform "white Christmas" while everyone raises a glass, and toasts, "May your days be merry and bright; and may all your Christmases be white."
</p><p>In 1868, rumors of a <a href="/wiki/Sea_monster" title="Sea monster">sea monster</a> attacking ships in the Pacific Ocean have disrupted shipping lanes. The United States invites Professor Pierre M. Aronnax and his assistant, Conseil, onto a Navy expedition to prove the monster's existence. On board with them is the cocky master harpooner Ned Land.
</p><p>After months of searching, the "monster" is spotted shortly before it rams the warship. Ned and Aronnax are thrown overboard, and Conseil goes in after Aronnax. The helpless, crippled frigate drifts away, and no one aboard responds to the overboard passengers. The three find a strange-looking metal vessel, and realize the "monster" is a man-made "submerging boat" that appears deserted. Aronnax finds a large viewport and witnesses an underwater funeral.
</p><p>Ned, Aronnax, and Conseil attempt to leave in their lifeboat, but the submarine crew stops the castaways. The captain introduces himself as Nemo, master of the <i><a href="/wiki/Nautilus_(Verne)" title="Nautilus (Verne)">Nautilus</a></i>. He returns Ned and Conseil to the deck while offering Aronnax, whom he recognizes for his work, the chance to stay. After Aronnax proves willing to die with his companions, Nemo allows Ned and Conseil to remain.
</p><p>Nemo takes them to the <a href="/wiki/Penal_colony" title="Penal colony">penal colony</a> island of Rura Penthe. Nemo was a prisoner there, as were many of his crew. The prisoners are loading a munitions ship. The <i>Nautilus</i> rams it, destroying its cargo and killing the crew. An anguished Nemo tells Aronnax that his actions have saved thousands from death in war; he also discloses that this "hated nation" tortured his wife and son to death while attempting to force him to reveal the secrets of his work. Ned discovers the coordinates of Nemo's secret island base, Vulcania, and releases messages in bottles, hoping somebody will find them.
</p><p>Off the coast of <a href="/wiki/New_Guinea" title="New Guinea">New Guinea</a>, the <i>Nautilus</i> becomes stranded on a reef. Ned is surprised when Nemo allows him to go ashore with Conseil, ostensibly to collect specimens, while strictly admonishing them to stay on the beach. Ned goes off alone to explore avenues of escape. While drinking from a pool, he sees human skulls on stakes. Ned runs for his life and rejoins Conseil, and they row away, pursued by cannibals. Aboard ship, the cannibals are repelled by electrical charges through its hull. Nemo is furious with Ned for disobeying his orders, confining him to the brig.
</p><p>A warship approaches, firing upon <i>Nautilus</i>, which descends into the depths, where it attracts a <a href="/wiki/Giant_squid" title="Giant squid">giant squid</a>. After a similar electric charge fails to repel the monster, Nemo and his men surface during a storm to dislodge it. Nemo is caught in one of its tentacles. Ned, having escaped from captivity, saves Nemo from drowning. Nemo has a change of heart and claims he wants to make peace with the world.
</p><p>As the <i>Nautilus</i> nears Vulcania, Nemo finds the island surrounded by warships whose marines are converging on his base. As Nemo goes ashore, Ned tries to identify himself as the author of the bottled messages. Aronnax is furious, recognizing that Nemo will destroy all evidence of his discoveries. Nemo enters the base and activates a time bomb, but is mortally wounded on <i>Nautilus</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s deck from a <a href="/wiki/Slug_(projectile)" title="Slug (projectile)">slug</a> to the back. After navigating the submarine away from Vulcania, Nemo announces he will be "taking the <i>Nautilus</i> down for the last time". The crew declare they will accompany their <a href="/wiki/The_captain_goes_down_with_the_ship" title="The captain goes down with the ship">captain in death</a>.
</p><p>Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned are confined to their cabins. The Nautilus's crew also retreat to their cabins at Nemo's instructions. Ned escapes and manages to surface the <i>Nautilus</i>, hitting a reef in the process and causing the sub to flood. Nemo staggers to his salon viewport, watching his beloved sea as he dies.
</p><p>Aronnax tries retrieving his detailed journal, but the urgency of their escape obliges Ned to knock him unconscious and carry him out. The companions witness Vulcania explode, and Ned apologizes to Aronnax for hitting him. As the <i>Nautilus</i> disappears beneath the waves, Nemo's last words to Aronnax echo: "There is hope for the future. And when the world is ready for a new and better life, all this will someday come to pass, in God's good time".
</p><p>On Christmas morning, 1909, in a quaint Midwestern town, Jim Dear gives his wife Darling an <a href="/wiki/American_Cocker_Spaniel" title="American Cocker Spaniel">American Cocker Spaniel</a> puppy that she names Lady. Lady enjoys a happy life with the couple and befriends two local neighborhood dogs, Jock, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scottish_terrier" title="Scottish terrier">Scottish terrier</a>, and Trusty, a <a href="/wiki/Bloodhound" title="Bloodhound">bloodhound</a>. Meanwhile, across town, a stray <a href="/wiki/Mongrel" title="Mongrel">mixed-breed dog</a> called the Tramp lives on his own, dining on scraps from Tony's <a href="/wiki/Italian_cuisine" title="Italian cuisine">Italian restaurant</a> and protecting his fellow strays Peg (a <a href="/wiki/Pekingese" title="Pekingese">Pekingese</a>) and Bull (a <a href="/wiki/Bulldog" title="Bulldog">bulldog</a>) from the local <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Animal_control_officer" title="Animal control officer">dogcatcher</a>. One day, Lady is saddened after her owners begin treating her rather coldly. Jock and Trusty visit her and determine that their change in behavior is due to Darling expecting a baby. While Jock and Trusty try to explain what a baby is, Tramp interrupts the conversation and offers his own thoughts on the matter, making Jock and Trusty take an immediate dislike to the stray and order him out of the yard. As Tramp leaves, he reminds Lady that "when a baby moves in, a dog moves out."
</p><p>Eventually, the baby arrives and the couple introduces Lady to the infant, of whom Lady becomes very fond and protective. Soon after, Jim Dear and Darling leave for a trip, with their Aunt Sarah looking after the baby and the house. Aunt Sarah's two trouble-making <a href="/wiki/Siamese_cat" title="Siamese cat">Siamese cats</a>, Si and Am, deliberately mess up the house and trick her into thinking that Lady attacked them. Aunt Sarah then takes Lady to a pet shop to get a muzzle. Terrified, Lady flees, only to be pursued by a trio of stray dogs. Tramp rescues her, fighting off the vicious strays, and finds a <a href="/wiki/Beaver" title="Beaver">beaver</a> at the local zoo who can remove the muzzle. Later, Tramp shows Lady how he lives "footloose and collar-free", eventually leading into a candlelit dinner at Tony's. Lady begins to fall in love with Tramp, but she chooses to return home in order to watch over the baby. Tramp offers to escort Lady back home, but when Tramp decides to chase hens around a farmyard for fun, Lady is captured by the dog catcher and brought to the local dog pound. While at the pound, the other dogs (including Peg and Bull, who have been caught) reveal to Lady that Tramp has had multiple girlfriends in the past, and they feel it is unlikely that he will ever settle down. Lady is eventually claimed by Aunt Sarah, who chains her in the backyard as punishment for running away.
</p><p>Jock and Trusty visit to comfort Lady, but when Tramp arrives to apologize, Lady angrily confronts him about his past girlfriends and failure to rescue her from the pound. Tramp sadly leaves, but immediately thereafter a rat sneaks into the house. Lady sees the rat and barks frantically at it, but Aunt Sarah tells her to be quiet. Tramp hears her barking and rushes back, entering the house and cornering the rat in the nursery. Lady breaks free and rushes to the nursery, where Tramp inadvertently knocks over the baby's crib before ultimately killing the rat. The commotion alerts Aunt Sarah, who sees both dogs in the room and thinks they are trying to harm the baby. She pushes Tramp in a closet and locks Lady in the basement, then calls the pound to take Tramp away. Jim Dear and Darling return home as the dog catcher departs, and when they release Lady, she leads them to the dead rat. Overhearing everything, Jock and Trusty chase after the dog catcher's wagon. The dogs are able to track down the wagon and scare the horses, causing the wagon to crash. Jim Dear arrives in a taxi with Lady, and she reunites with Tramp, but their joy is short-lived when they find Trusty pinned underneath the wagon's wheel, motionless, with Jock howling mournfully.
</p><p>That Christmas, Tramp has been adopted into the family, and he and Lady have started their own family, with Lady having given birth to a litter of four puppies (three daughters who look identical to Lady and <a href="/wiki/Scamp_(comics)" title="Scamp (comics)">one son who looks identical to Tramp</a>). Jock comes to see the family along with Trusty, who is still alive and merely suffered a broken leg, which is still healing. Thanks to the puppies, Trusty has a fresh audience for his old stories, but he has forgotten them.

Eager to join the fighting, Roberts repeatedly requests a transfer. Morton is forced by regulation to forward his requests, but refuses to endorse them, which means that they are always rejected. Roberts shares quarters with <a href="/wiki/Ensign_(rank)" title="Ensign (rank)">Ensign</a> Frank Thurlowe Pulver (<a href="/wiki/Jack_Lemmon" title="Jack Lemmon">Jack Lemmon</a>). Pulver spends most of his time idling in his bunk and avoids the captain at all costs, so much so, that Morton is initially unaware that Pulver is part of the crew. Once discovered, Pulver cowers before Morton despite bold ideas for revenge expressed to the crew. 
</p><p>Roberts surreptitiously requests and is granted crew <a href="/wiki/Shore_leave" title="Shore leave">liberty</a> from one of Morton’s superiors; a port captain who wishes to reward the <i>Reluctant's</i> crew for meeting a difficult resupply schedule. The liberty is supposed to be at their next resupply stop, but when the ship reaches an idyllic South Pacific island, Morton denies the crew their much-needed shore leave. In private, Morton tells Roberts that the crew will not get liberty as long as he continues to request a transfer and writes letters regarding disharmony aboard the ship, which endanger Morton's chances of promotion. Morton strikes a bargain with Roberts: In exchange for never requesting another transfer, never bending Morton's rules, and never revealing what has made him change his attitude, Morton will grant the crew liberty.
</p><p>Ashore, the crew lets loose after months of pent-up frustration. Many crewmen are arrested and hauled back to the ship by the <a href="/wiki/Military_police" title="Military police">military police</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Shore_patrol" title="Shore patrol">shore patrol</a>. The next morning, Morton is reprimanded by the port captain and ordered to leave port immediately. Morton is almost speechless with rage at the black mark on his sterling record.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the crewmen are mystified by Roberts’ new strictness. Morton deceives them into thinking that Roberts is trying to get a promotion. When a crew member informs Roberts of a new Navy policy which might assist him in getting a transfer despite the captain's opposition, Roberts refuses to take advantage of it.
</p><p>News of the Allied victory in Europe depresses Roberts further, knowing the war may end soon without his ever seeing combat. Inspired by a patriotic radio speech celebrating <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/VE_Day" title="VE Day">VE Day</a>, Roberts throws Morton's prized palm tree overboard. The captain demands the identity of the culprit, but no one steps forward. He eventually realizes that Roberts is the only person aboard with the nerve to do it. Morton summons him to his quarters and accuses him of the deed. An open microphone reveals to the crew what changed Roberts.
</p><p>Weeks later, Roberts receives an unexpected transfer. "Doc" (<a href="/wiki/William_Powell" title="William Powell">William Powell</a>), the ship's doctor and Roberts' friend, confides to him that the crew risked court-martial by submitting a transfer request with Morton's forged <a href="/wiki/Imprimatur#Other_senses" title="Imprimatur">imprimatur</a>. Before he leaves, the crew presents Roberts with a handmade medal, the Order of the Palm, for "action against the enemy".
</p><p>Several weeks later, Pulver, who has been appointed cargo officer, receives a couple of letters. The first is from Roberts, who speaks enthusiastically about his new assignment aboard the <a href="/wiki/Destroyer" title="Destroyer">destroyer</a> USS <i>Livingston</i> during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Okinawa" title="Battle of Okinawa">Battle of Okinawa</a>. He goes on to say that he would rather have the Order of the Palm than the <a href="/wiki/Medal_of_Honor" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honor</a>. The second letter is from a college classmate of Pulver's who is also assigned to the <i>Livingston</i>, which reveals that Roberts was killed in a <a href="/wiki/Kamikaze" title="Kamikaze">kamikaze</a> attack shortly after the first letter had been posted.
</p><p>Incensed, Pulver throws the captain’s replacement palm tree overboard. He then marches into Morton's cabin, openly bragging about it and brazenly demanding to know why Morton has cancelled the showing of a film that night. Morton slowly shakes his head, realizing that his problems have not gone away.

Bithiah names the baby <a href="/wiki/Moses" title="Moses">Moses</a>.
</p><p>Prince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with <a href="/wiki/Ethiopia" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> and establishing an alliance. Moses and princess <a href="/wiki/Nefertari" title="Nefertari">Nefretiri</a> fall in love, but she must marry the next Pharaoh. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh <a href="/wiki/Seti_I" title="Seti I">Sethi</a>'s jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter <a href="/wiki/Joshua" title="Joshua">Joshua</a>, who tells him of the <a href="/wiki/Yahweh" title="Yahweh">Hebrew God</a>. Moses saves an elderly woman from being crushed not knowing that she is his biological mother, Yoshebel, and he reprimands the taskmaster and overseer Baka.
</p><p>Moses reforms the treatment of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Slaves" title="Slaves">slaves</a> on the project, but Prince <a href="/wiki/Ramesses_II" title="Ramesses II">Rameses</a>, Moses's adoptive brother, charges him with planning an insurrection. Moses says he is making his workers more productive, making Rameses wonder if Moses is the man the Hebrews are calling the Deliverer.
</p><p>Nefretiri learns from Memnet that Moses is the son of Hebrew slaves. She kills Memnet but reveals the story to Moses only after he finds the piece of <a href="/wiki/Levite" title="Levite">Levite</a> cloth he was wrapped in as a baby, which Memnet had kept. Moses follows Bithiah to Yoshebel's house where he meets his biological mother, Brother Aaron, and Sister Miriam.
</p><p>Moses learns more about the slaves by working with them. Nefretiri urges him to return to the palace so he may help his people when he becomes pharaoh, to which he agrees after he completes a final task. Moses saves Joshua from death by killing Baka, telling Joshua that he too is Hebrew. The confession is witnessed by the overseer <a href="/wiki/Dathan" title="Dathan">Dathan</a>, who then reports to Rameses. After being arrested, Moses explains that he is not the Deliverer, but would free the slaves if he could. Sethi banishes Moses to the desert leaving Rameses as the sole heir. Yoshebel dies sometime later.
</p><p>Moses makes his way across the desert to a well in <a href="/wiki/Midian" title="Midian">Midian</a>. After defending seven sisters from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Amalekites" title="Amalekites">Amalekites</a>, Moses is housed with the girls' father <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jethro_(Bible)" title="Jethro (Bible)">Jethro</a>, a Bedouin sheik, who worships the God of Abraham. Moses marries Jethro's eldest daughter <a href="/wiki/Zipporah" title="Zipporah">Sephora</a>. Later, he finds Joshua, who has escaped hard labor. While farming, Moses sees the <a href="/wiki/Burning_bush" title="Burning bush">burning bush</a> on the summit of <a href="/wiki/Mount_Sinai" title="Mount Sinai">Mount Sinai</a> and hears the voice of God. Moses returns to Egypt to free the Hebrews.
</p><p>Moses comes before Rameses, now pharaoh, to win the slaves' freedom, turning his staff into a <a href="/wiki/Cobra" title="Cobra">cobra</a>. <a href="/wiki/Jannes_and_Jambres" title="Jannes and Jambres">Jannes</a> performs the same trick with his staves, but Moses's snake swallows his. Rameses prohibits straw from being provided to the Hebrews to make their bricks. Nefretiri rescues Moses from being stoned to death by the Hebrews wherein he reveals that he is married.
</p><p>Egypt is visited by plagues. Moses turns the river Nile to blood at a festival of <a href="/wiki/Khnum" title="Khnum">Khnum</a> and brings burning hail down upon Pharaoh's palace. Moses warns him the next plague to fall upon Egypt will be summoned by Pharaoh himself. Enraged at the plagues, Rameses orders all first-born Hebrews to die, but a cloud of death instead kills all the firstborn of Egypt, including the child of Rameses and Nefretiri. Angrily, Pharaoh exiles the Hebrews, which begins <a href="/wiki/The_Exodus" title="The Exodus">the Exodus</a> from Egypt.
</p><p>Rameses takes his army and pursues the Hebrews to the <a href="/wiki/Red_Sea" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a>. Moses uses God's help to stop the Egyptians with a pillar of fire and parts the Red Sea. After the Hebrews make it to safety, Moses releases the walls of water, drowning the Egyptian army. A devastated Rameses returns empty-handed to Nefretiri, stating that he now acknowledges Moses's god as God.
</p><p>Moses again ascends the mountain with Joshua. Impatiently, Dathan urges a reluctant Aaron to construct a <a href="/wiki/Golden_calf" title="Golden calf">golden calf</a> idol as a gift for Rameses. A wild and decadent orgy is held by most of the Hebrews.
</p><p>Moses sees the <a href="/wiki/Ten_Commandments" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a> created by God in two stone tablets. Moses descends from the mountain to the sight of decadence. Enraged, he throws the tablets at the golden calf, which explodes, killing the wicked revelers, and causing the others to wander in the wilderness for 40 years.
</p><p>Forty years later, an elderly Moses leads the Hebrews towards <a href="/wiki/Canaan" title="Canaan">Canaan</a>. However, he could not enter the Promised land due to his disobedience to the Lord at the Waters of Strife. He instead names Joshua as leader, and spends the rest of his life at Mount Nebo until his death.
</p><p>In early 1943, British <a href="/wiki/Prisoner_of_war" title="Prisoner of war">POWs</a> arrive by train at a <a href="/wiki/Empire_of_Japan" title="Empire of Japan">Japanese</a> prison camp in Burma. The commandant, Colonel Saito, informs them that all prisoners, regardless of rank, are to work on the construction of a railway bridge over the <a href="/wiki/Khwae_Yai_River" title="Khwae Yai River">River Kwai</a> that will connect Bangkok and Rangoon. The senior British officer, Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson, informs Saito that the <a href="/wiki/Geneva_Convention_(1929)" title="Geneva Convention (1929)">Geneva Conventions</a> exempt officers from manual labour. Nicholson later forbids any escape attempts because they had been ordered by headquarters to surrender, and escapes could be seen as defiance of orders.
</p><p>At the morning assembly, Nicholson orders his officers to remain behind when the enlisted men march off to work. Saito threatens to have them shot, but Nicholson refuses to back down. When Major Clipton, the British medical officer, warns Saito there are too many witnesses for him to get away with murder, Saito leaves the officers standing all day in the intense heat. That evening, the officers are placed in a punishment hut, while Nicholson is locked in an iron box.
</p><p>Meanwhile, three prisoners attempt to escape. Two are shot dead, but <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy" title="United States Navy">United States Navy</a> Commander Shears gets away, although badly wounded. He stumbles into a village of natives, who nurse him back to health and then help him leave by boat.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the prisoners work as little as possible and sabotage whatever they can. Should Saito fail to meet his deadline, he would be obliged to commit <a href="/wiki/Seppuku" title="Seppuku">ritual suicide</a>. Desperate, he uses the anniversary of Japan's victory in the <a href="/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War" title="Russo-Japanese War">Russo-Japanese War</a> as an excuse to save face and announces a general amnesty, releasing Nicholson and his officers and exempting them from manual labour.
</p><p>Nicholson is shocked by the poor job being done by his men. Over the protests of some of his officers, he orders Captain Reeves and Major Hughes to design and build a proper bridge to maintain his men's morale. As the Japanese engineers had chosen a poor site, the original construction is abandoned and a new bridge begun downstream.
</p><p>Shears is enjoying his hospital stay in Ceylon when British Major Warden invites him to join a mission to destroy the bridge before it is completed. Shears is so appalled, he confesses he is not an officer; he impersonated one, expecting better treatment from the Japanese. Warden responds that he already knew and that the American Navy agreed to transfer him to the British to avoid embarrassment. Realising he has no choice, Shears volunteers.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Nicholson drives his men hard to complete the bridge on time. For him, its completion will exemplify the ingenuity and hard work of the <a href="/wiki/British_Army" title="British Army">British Army</a> long after the war's end. When he asks that their Japanese counterparts pitch in as well, a resigned Saito replies that he has already given the order. Clipton expresses grave doubts about the sanity of Colonel Nicholson's efforts to build the bridge in order to show up his Japanese captors.
</p><p>The four commandos parachute in, though one is killed on landing. Later, Warden is wounded in an encounter with a Japanese patrol and has to be carried on a litter. He, Shears, and Canadian Lieutenant Joyce reach the river in time with the assistance of Siamese women bearers and their village chief, Khun Yai. Under cover of darkness, Shears and Joyce plant explosives on the bridge towers below the water line.
</p><p>A train carrying important dignitaries and soldiers is scheduled to be the first to cross the bridge the following day, so Warden waits to destroy both. However, by daybreak the water level has dropped, exposing the wire connecting the explosives to the detonator. Nicholson spots the wire and brings it to Saito's attention. As the train approaches, they hurry down to the riverbank to investigate.
</p><p>Joyce, manning the detonator, breaks cover and stabs Saito to death. Nicholson yells for help, while attempting to stop Joyce from reaching the detonator. When Joyce is mortally wounded by Japanese fire, Shears swims across the river, but is himself shot. Recognising the dying Shears, Nicholson exclaims, "What have I done?" Warden fires a <a href="/wiki/Mortar_(weapon)" title="Mortar (weapon)">mortar</a>, wounding Nicholson. The dying colonel stumbles towards the detonator and collapses on the plunger just in time to blow up the bridge and send the train hurtling into the river below. Warden turns toward the only survivors of the commando raid, the women bearers, and begs their forgiveness for having to kill Joyce and Shears, and throws the mortar launcher away in disgust, and prepares to leave. Clipton, observing the carnage, shakes his head muttering, "Madness!, Madness!".
</p><p>In AD 26, <a href="/wiki/Judah_Ben-Hur" title="Judah Ben-Hur">Judah Ben-Hur</a> (<a href="/wiki/Charlton_Heston" title="Charlton Heston">Charlton Heston</a>) is a wealthy Jewish prince and merchant in <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, who lives with his mother, Miriam (<a href="/wiki/Martha_Scott" title="Martha Scott">Martha Scott</a>); his sister, Tirzah (<a href="/wiki/Cathy_O%27Donnell" title="Cathy O'Donnell">Cathy O'Donnell</a>); and their female servant Amrah (Stella Vitelleschi). The family's loyal slave, the merchant Simonides (<a href="/wiki/Sam_Jaffe" title="Sam Jaffe">Sam Jaffe</a>), pays a visit with his daughter, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Esther_(character)" title="Esther (character)">Esther</a> (<a href="/wiki/Haya_Harareet" title="Haya Harareet">Haya Harareet</a>). Judah and Esther fall in love at first sight, but she is bethrothed to another. Judah's childhood friend, the <a href="/wiki/Roman_citizenship" title="Roman citizenship">Roman citizen</a> <a href="/wiki/Messala_(Ben-Hur)" title="Messala (Ben-Hur)">Messala</a> (<a href="/wiki/Stephen_Boyd" title="Stephen Boyd">Stephen Boyd</a>), is now a <a href="/wiki/Military_tribune" title="Military tribune">tribune</a>. After several years away from Jerusalem, Messala returns as the new commander of the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Roman_legions#Early_Empire_legions" title="List of Roman legions">Roman garrison</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Antonia_Fortress" title="Antonia Fortress">Fortress of Antonia</a>. Messala believes in the glory of <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Rome and its imperial power</a>, while Judah is devoted to his faith and the freedom of the Jewish people. This difference causes tension between the friends, and results in their split after Messala issues an ultimatum demanding that Judah deliver potential rebels amongst the populace to the Roman authorities.
</p><p>During the parade for the new <a href="/wiki/Prefect" title="Prefect">governor</a> of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Iudaea_Province" title="Iudaea Province">Judea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Valerius_Gratus" title="Valerius Gratus">Valerius Gratus</a> (<a href="/wiki/Mino_Doro" title="Mino Doro">Mino Doro</a>), loose tiles fall from the roof of Judah's house. Gratus is thrown from his spooked horse and nearly killed. Although Messala knows this was an accident, he condemns Judah to the <a href="/wiki/Galley_slave" title="Galley slave">galleys</a> and imprisons Miriam and Tirzah due to his residual anger at Judah for his refusal to help. By punishing a known friend and prominent citizen, he hopes to intimidate the Jewish populace. Judah swears to take revenge on Messala. As he and other slaves are being marched to the galleys, they stop in <a href="/wiki/Nazareth" title="Nazareth">Nazareth</a> to water the Romans' horses. Desperate with thirst, Judah begs for water, but the commander of the Roman detachment denies it to him. He collapses, but is revived when Jesus of Nazareth (<a href="/wiki/Claude_Heater" title="Claude Heater">Claude Heater</a>) gives him water. After three years as a galley slave, Judah is assigned to the flagship of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_Consul#Under_the_Empire" title="Roman Consul">Roman Consul</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quintus_Arrius_(character)" title="Quintus Arrius (character)">Quintus Arrius</a> (<a href="/wiki/Jack_Hawkins" title="Jack Hawkins">Jack Hawkins</a>), who has been charged with destroying a fleet of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Macedon" title="Macedon">Macedonian</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pirates" title="Pirates">pirates</a>. Arrius admires Judah's determination and self-discipline, and offers to train him as a <a href="/wiki/Gladiator" title="Gladiator">gladiator</a> or <a href="/wiki/Chariot_racing" title="Chariot racing">charioteer</a>. Judah declines the offer, declaring that God will aid him in his quest for vengeance. When the Roman fleet encounters the Macedonians, Arrius orders all the rowers except Judah to be chained to their oars. Arrius' galley is rammed and sunk, but Judah unchains the other rowers and rescues Arrius. In despair, Arrius wrongly believes the battle ended in defeat and attempts to atone in the Roman way by <a href="/wiki/Suicide#Ritual_suicide" title="Suicide">falling on his sword</a>, but Judah stops him. They are rescued, and Arrius is credited with the Roman fleet's victory. Arrius successfully petitions Emperor <a href="/wiki/Tiberius" title="Tiberius">Tiberius</a> (<a href="/wiki/George_Relph" title="George Relph">George Relph</a>) to free Judah, and <a href="/wiki/Adoption_in_ancient_Rome" title="Adoption in ancient Rome">adopts him as his son</a>.
</p><p>Another year passes. Wealthy again, Judah learns <a href="/wiki/Culture_of_ancient_Rome" title="Culture of ancient Rome">Roman ways</a> and becomes a champion charioteer, but still longs for his family and homeland. Judah returns to Judea. Along the way, he meets <a href="/wiki/Biblical_Magi" title="Biblical Magi">Balthasar</a> (<a href="/wiki/Finlay_Currie" title="Finlay Currie">Finlay Currie</a>) and an Arab, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sheik_Ilderim" title="Sheik Ilderim">Sheik Ilderim</a> (<a href="/wiki/Hugh_Griffith" title="Hugh Griffith">Hugh Griffith</a>). After noting Judah's prowess as a charioteer, the sheik asks him to drive his <i><a href="/wiki/Quadriga" title="Quadriga">quadriga</a></i> in a race before the new governor of Judea, <a href="/wiki/Pontius_Pilate" title="Pontius Pilate">Pontius Pilate</a> (<a href="/wiki/Frank_Thring" title="Frank Thring">Frank Thring</a>). Judah declines, even after he learns that Messala will also compete. Judah returns to his home in Jerusalem. He meets Esther, and learns her arranged marriage did not occur and that she is still in love with him. He visits Messala and demands his mother and sister's freedom. The Romans discover that Miriam and Tirzah have contracted <a href="/wiki/Leprosy" title="Leprosy">leprosy</a> in prison, and expel them from the city. The women beg Esther to conceal their condition from Judah so that he may remember them as they were before, so she tells him that they died. This false revelation changes Judah's mind, and he decides to seek vengeance on Messala by competing against him in the chariot race. During the chariot race, Messala drives a <a href="/wiki/Scythed_chariot" title="Scythed chariot">chariot with blades on the hubs</a> to tear apart competing vehicles. He attempts to destroy Judah's chariot but wrecks his own instead. Messala is fatally trampled on by another passing chariot, while Judah wins the race. Before dying, Messala tells Judah that "the race is not over" and, in one last act of pure hatred, tells him to search for his family in the Valley of the Lepers "if you can even recognise them".
</p><p>Judah visits the nearby leper colony, where he confronts Esther while she is delivering supplies for his mother and sister. Esther convinces Judah to remain hidden from them for now and not break Miriam's wishes. Blaming Roman rule for his family's fate, Judah visits Pilate and rejects his <a href="/wiki/Property" title="Property">patrimony</a> and Roman citizenship. He returns with Esther to the Leper colony, reveals himself to Miriam and finds out that Tirzah is dying. Judah and Esther take Miriam and her daughter to see Jesus of Nazareth, but the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trial_of_Jesus" title="Trial of Jesus">trial of Jesus</a> has begun. As Jesus is being marched through the streets he collapses while carrying his cross. Judah recognizes him as the man who gave him water years before, and returns the gesture. Judah witnesses the crucifixion of Jesus, and Miriam and Tirzah are miraculously healed during the rainstorm following the crucifixion. Judah returns home a changed man and embraces Esther, Miriam and Tirzah.
</p><p>A family on their way to <a href="/wiki/New_Guinea" title="New Guinea">New Guinea</a> is chased by pirates into a storm. The captain and crew abandon the ship leaving the family shipwrecked off an uninhabited island. Father (<a href="/wiki/John_Mills" title="John Mills">John Mills</a>) and his two eldest sons Fritz and Ernst (<a href="/wiki/James_MacArthur" title="James MacArthur">James MacArthur</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tommy_Kirk" title="Tommy Kirk">Tommy Kirk</a>) salvage as much as they can from the wreck including livestock, tools, and even an organ. As they gather what can be removed from the ship, the pirates return and begin shooting at the ship. Fritz and Ernst begin readying the ship's cannon, but they only have one shot. Suddenly, the pirates turn around; Father has <a href="/wiki/File:ICS_India.svg" title="File:ICS India.svg">put up a flag</a> indicating the ship is under <a href="/wiki/Quarantine" title="Quarantine">quarantine</a> and that there is <a href="/wiki/Black_Death" title="Black Death">Black Death</a> aboard. The three men construct a <a href="/wiki/Tree_house" title="Tree house">tree house</a> home on the island while the youngest boy Francis (<a href="/wiki/Kevin_Corcoran" title="Kevin Corcoran">Kevin Corcoran</a>) investigates the wildlife and starts an impressive collection of animals including a young elephant, a capuchin monkey and two <a href="/wiki/Great_Dane" title="Great Dane">Great Danes</a> rescued from the ship which they name Duke and Turk. Mother (<a href="/wiki/Dorothy_McGuire" title="Dorothy McGuire">Dorothy McGuire</a>) prays to be rescued. The boys, particularly Ernst, also build inventions to provide modern amenities to the family such as drawing water and preserving food.
</p><p>Fritz and Ernst head off to explore the island to see if anyone else lives on it, or if it is connected to any other lands. While at a distant corner of the island, they again spot the pirates who originally drove them into the storm. The pirates have captured another ship and have the ship's captain, Captain Moreland (<a href="/wiki/Cecil_Parker" title="Cecil Parker">Cecil Parker</a>), and cabin boy "Bertie" captives for ransom. Fritz and Ernst rescue Bertie but Captain Moreland, Bertie's grandfather, stays behind. The three dodge the pirates and head back to the family's tree house. En route, they discover that Bertie is really Roberta (<a href="/wiki/Janet_Munro" title="Janet Munro">Janet Munro</a>) and not a boy at all. The three fend off snakes and hyenas as they head home and even rescue a zebra foal, then lead it home. They arrive back at the treehouse at Christmas.
</p><p>Father realizes the pirates will try to reclaim Roberta and decides to make a stand against them. Defenses are prepared by building booby-traps and fortifying a rocky outcropping. They blow up the ship's wreckage in an attempt to make it difficult for the pirates to remember where the family went aground. While prepping for the pirate attack, Fritz and Ernst vie for the affections of Roberta. Ernst is more studious and attempts to impress her with his knowledge and intelligence while Fritz, older and more experienced, uses his charm and physical attributes to attract her. Fritz and Ernst eventually come to blows over her and are stopped only by the intervention of Father. He declares the next day the first holiday for "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/New_Switzerland" title="New Switzerland">New Switzerland</a>" in an attempt to divert everyone. While prepping for the race (everyone has an animal to ride: Francis has the elephant, Ernst the ostrich, Roberta the zebra, the monkey on Duke, etc.), Mother fires the gun to signal the start of the race; the pirates, who are at that time sailing the coast looking for the place they last saw the ship that brought the family to the island, hear the gun and know the family is near.
</p><p>Led by their captain (<a href="/wiki/Sessue_Hayakawa" title="Sessue Hayakawa">Sessue Hayakawa</a>), the pirates storm the island. The family manages a brave defense but are sorely pressed. Their defenses include pits with a tiger in one pit, rock piles, a log pile and coconut bombs (hollowed out coconuts filled with gunpowder with a fuse), all of which cause problems for the attacking pirates. When the pirate leader waves a <a href="/wiki/White_flag" title="White flag">white flag</a> the family imagines they have routed the pirates, but the pirates instead are sneaking around the back of the fort. Francis' much-maligned "pirate alarm" is the only thing that warns them of the surprise attack. They begin defending the fortress but are soon down to only a few shots with their muskets. At this critical moment, a ship appears on the horizon captained by Roberta's grandfather Captain Moreland and fires its cannons while the retreating pirates are trying to make a desperate escape.  The cannon fire hits the pirate ship while the family rejoices. Father, Mother and Francis choose to remain on the island with Duke, Turk, and Francis' collection of animals while Captain Moreland notes that Father will likely be recommended as Governor of the new colony. As for the rest of the family, Ernst chooses to return to Europe with the rescuers in order to enroll in a university to continue his studies while Fritz and Roberta plan to marry (presumably by virtue of her grandfather's sea captaincy) and make New Switzerland their home.
</p><p>In the 1st century BC, the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Republic" title="Roman Republic">Roman Republic</a> has slid into corruption, its menial work done by armies of slaves. One of these, a proud and gifted <a href="/wiki/Thrace" title="Thrace">Thracian</a> named Spartacus (<a href="/wiki/Kirk_Douglas" title="Kirk Douglas">Kirk Douglas</a>), is so uncooperative in his position in a mining pit that he is sentenced to death by starvation. By chance, he is displayed to unctuous Roman businessman Lentulus Batiatus (<a href="/wiki/Peter_Ustinov" title="Peter Ustinov">Peter Ustinov</a>), who - impressed by his ferocity - purchases Spartacus for his gladiatorial school, where he instructs trainer Marcellus (<a href="/wiki/Charles_McGraw" title="Charles McGraw">Charles McGraw</a>) to not overdo his indoctrination because he thinks "he has quality". Amid the abuse, Spartacus forms a quiet relationship with a serving woman named Varinia (<a href="/wiki/Jean_Simmons" title="Jean Simmons">Jean Simmons</a>), whom he refuses to rape when she is sent to "entertain" him in his cell. Spartacus and Varinia are subsequently forced to endure numerous humiliations for defying the conditions of servitude.
</p><p>Batiatus receives a visit from the immensely wealthy Roman senator <a href="/wiki/Marcus_Licinius_Crassus" title="Marcus Licinius Crassus">Marcus Licinius Crassus</a> (<a href="/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>), who aims to become dictator of the stagnant republic. Crassus buys Varinia on a whim, and for the amusement of his companions arranges for Spartacus and three others to fight in pairs. When Spartacus is disarmed, his opponent, an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ethnic_groups_of_Africa" title="Ethnic groups of Africa">African</a> named Draba (<a href="/wiki/Woody_Strode" title="Woody Strode">Woody Strode</a>), spares his life in a burst of defiance and attacks the Roman audience, but is killed by an arena guard and Crassus. The next day, with the ludus' atmosphere still tense over this episode, Batiatus takes Varinia away to Crassus's house in Rome. Spartacus kills Marcellus, who was taunting him over his affections, and their fight escalates into a riot. The gladiators overwhelm their guards and escape into the Italian countryside.
</p><p>Spartacus is elected chief of the fugitives and decides to lead them out of <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a> and back to their homes. They plunder Roman country estates as they go, collecting enough money to buy sea transport from Rome's foes, the pirates of <a href="/wiki/Cilicia" title="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>. Countless other slaves join the group, making it as large as an army. One of the new arrivals is Varinia, who escaped while being delivered to Crassus. Another is a slave entertainer named Antoninus (<a href="/wiki/Tony_Curtis" title="Tony Curtis">Tony Curtis</a>), who also fled Crassus's service. Privately, Spartacus feels mentally inadequate because of his lack of education during years of servitude.  However, he proves an excellent leader and organizes his diverse followers into a tough and self-sufficient community. Varinia, now his informal wife, becomes pregnant by him, and he also comes to regard the spirited Antoninus as a sort of son.
</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Roman_Senate" title="Roman Senate">Roman Senate</a> becomes increasingly alarmed as Spartacus defeats the multiple armies it sends against him. Crassus's populist opponent Gracchus (<a href="/wiki/Charles_Laughton" title="Charles Laughton">Charles Laughton</a>) knows that his rival will try to use the crisis as a justification for seizing control of the Roman army. To try and prevent this, Gracchus channels as much military power as possible into the hands of his own protege, a young senator named Julius Caesar (<a href="/wiki/John_Gavin" title="John Gavin">John Gavin</a>). Although Caesar lacks Crassus's contempt for the lower classes of Rome, he mistakes the man's rigid outlook for nobility. Thus, when Gracchus reveals that he has bribed the Cilicians to get Spartacus out of Italy and rid Rome of the slave army, Caesar regards such tactics as beneath him and goes over to Crassus.
</p><p>Crassus uses a bribe of his own to make the pirates abandon Spartacus and has the Roman army secretly force the rebels away from the coastline towards Rome. Amid panic that Spartacus means to sack the city, the Senate gives Crassus absolute power. Now surrounded by Romans, Spartacus convinces his men to die fighting. Just by rebelling and proving themselves human, he says that they have struck a blow against slavery. In the ensuing battle, after initially breaking the ranks of Crassus's legions, the slave army ends up trapped between Crassus and two other forces advancing from behind, and most of them are massacred. Afterward, the Romans try to locate the rebel leader for special punishment by offering a pardon (and return to enslavement) if the men will identify Spartacus, living or dead. Every surviving man responds by shouting "I'm Spartacus!" (an idea from Fast's novel, not documented by history). As a result, Crassus has them all sentenced to death by <a href="/wiki/Crucifixion" title="Crucifixion">crucifixion</a> along the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Via_Appia" title="Via Appia">Via Appia</a> between Rome and <a href="/wiki/Capua" title="Capua">Capua</a>, where the revolt began.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Crassus has found Varinia and Spartacus's newborn son and has taken them prisoner. He is disturbed by the idea that Spartacus can command more love and loyalty than he can and hopes to compensate by making Varinia as devoted to him as she was to her former husband. When she rejects him, he furiously seeks out Spartacus (whom he recognizes from having watched him at Batiatus' school) and forces him to fight Antoninus to the death. The survivor is to be crucified, along with all the other men captured after the great battle. Spartacus kills Antoninus to spare him this terrible fate. The incident leaves Crassus worried about Spartacus's potential to live in legend as a <a href="/wiki/Martyr" title="Martyr">martyr</a>. In other matters, he is also worried about Caesar, whom he senses will someday eclipse him.
</p><p>Gracchus, having seen Rome fall into tyranny, commits suicide. Before doing so, he bribes his friend Batiatus to rescue Spartacus's family from Crassus and carry them away to freedom. On the way out of Rome, the group passes under Spartacus's cross. Varinia is able to comfort him in his dying moments by showing him his little son, who will grow up free and knowing who his father was.
</p><p>During a lunchtime tryst in a <a href="/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona" title="Phoenix, Arizona">Phoenix</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> hotel,  real-estate secretary, <a href="/wiki/Marion_Crane" title="Marion Crane">Marion Crane</a>, and her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, discuss how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client leaves a $40,000 cash payment on a property. Marion's boss asks her to deposit the money in the bank, and allows her to leave work early after she complains of a headache. Once home, she decides to steal the money and drive to Fairvale, <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, where Sam lives.
</p><p>En route to Fairvale, Marion pulls over on the side of the road and falls asleep; she is awakened by a state patrol trooper. Suspicious about her skittish behavior, he follows her as she drives away. Hoping to lose him, Marion stops at a <a href="/wiki/Bakersfield,_California" title="Bakersfield, California">Bakersfield</a>, California automobile dealership and trades in her <a href="/wiki/Ford_Mainline" title="Ford Mainline">Ford Mainline</a>, with its Arizona license plates, for a <a href="/wiki/Ford_Custom" title="Ford Custom">Ford Custom</a> 300 with California tags. The officer sees Marion at the car dealership and eyes her suspiciously as she abruptly drives away.
</p><p>During a heavy rainstorm, Marion stops for the night at the Bates Motel. The proprietor, <a href="/wiki/Norman_Bates" title="Norman Bates">Norman Bates</a>, invites her to share a light dinner after she checks in. She accepts his invitation but overhears an argument between Norman and <a href="/wiki/Norma_Bates_(Psycho)" title="Norma Bates (Psycho)">his mother</a> about bringing a woman into their <a href="/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture" title="Gothic Revival architecture">Gothic</a> house, which sits perched above the motel. Instead they eat in the motel parlor, where he tells her about his life with his mother, who is mentally ill and forbids him to have an independent life.
</p><p>Moved by Norman's story, Marion decides to drive back to Phoenix in the morning to return the stolen money, which she hides in a folded newspaper on the nightstand. As she showers, a shadowy figure stabs her to death with a <a href="/wiki/Chef%27s_knife" title="Chef's knife">chef's knife</a>. After seeing <a href="/wiki/Blood" title="Blood">blood</a>, Norman panics and runs to Marion's room, where he discovers her body. He cleans up the crime scene, putting Marion's corpse and her possessions—including the stolen money—into the trunk of her car and sinking it in the swamps near the motel.
</p><p>A week later, Marion's sister <a href="/wiki/Lila_Crane" title="Lila Crane">Lila</a> arrives in Fairvale and confronts Sam about Marion's whereabouts. Private investigator Milton Arbogast approaches them and confirms that Marion is wanted for stealing the $40,000. He sleuths local hotels and motels, and Norman's evasive and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicion. After hearing that Marion met Norman's mother, he asks to speak with her, but Norman refuses to allow it. Arbogast updates Sam and Lila about his search for Marion and promises to phone again soon. He goes to the Bates' home in search of Norman's mother; as he reaches the top of the stairs, he is murdered.
</p><p>When Lila and Sam do not hear from Arbogast, Sam visits the motel. He sees a figure in the house who he assumes is Mrs. Bates, but she ignores his knocking. Lila and Sam go to the local deputy sheriff, who informs them that Mrs. Bates died in a murder-suicide ten years ago. The sheriff concludes that Arbogast lied to Sam and Lila so he could pursue Marion and the money. Convinced that some ill has befallen Arbogast, Lila and Sam make their way to the motel. Norman carries his mother from her room and hides her in the fruit cellar against her will.
</p><p>At the motel, Sam distracts Norman by engaging in conversation while Lila cases the property and sneaks inside the house. After Sam grills him, Norman becomes agitated, knocks Sam out, and rushes to the house. Lila hides in the cellar, where she finds Mrs. Bates in a chair. Lila turns her around and discovers she is a mummified corpse. Lila screams as Norman runs into the cellar, holding a knife and wearing his mother's clothes and a wig. Before Norman can attack Lila, Sam, having regained consciousness, subdues him.
</p><p>At the courthouse, a psychiatrist explains that Norman murdered Mrs. Bates and her lover ten years ago out of jealousy. Unable to bear the guilt, he <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Exhumation" title="Exhumation">exhumed</a> her corpse and began to treat it as if she were still alive. He recreated his mother in his own mind as an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Multiple_personality_disorder" title="Multiple personality disorder">alternate personality</a>, dressing in her clothes and talking to himself in her voice. This "Mother" personality is jealous and possessive: whenever Norman feels attracted to a woman, "Mother" kills her. As "Mother", Norman killed two young girls before stabbing Marion and Arbogast to death. The psychiatrist says the "Mother" personality has taken permanent hold of Norman's mind. While Norman sits in a holding cell, "Mother"<span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s <a href="/wiki/Voice-over" title="Voice-over">voice-over</a> protests that the murders were Norman's doing. Marion's car is pulled out of the swamp.
</p><p>Songwriter Roger Radcliffe lives in a bachelor flat in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, along with his <a href="/wiki/Dalmatian_dog" title="Dalmatian dog">Dalmatian</a>, Pongo. Bored with bachelor life, Pongo decides to find a wife for Roger and a mate for himself. While watching various female dog-human pairs out the window, he spots the perfect one, a woman named Anita and her female Dalmatian, Perdita. He quickly gets Roger out of the house and drags him through the park to arrange a meeting. He and Anita fall in love and get married.
</p><p>Later, Perdita gives birth to a litter of 15 puppies. That same night, they are visited by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cruella_De_Vil" title="Cruella De Vil">Cruella De Vil</a>, a wealthy former schoolmate of Anita's. She offers to buy the entire litter, but Roger says they are not for sale, leading to a falling out. A few weeks later, she hires her henchmen, Jasper and Horace, to steal them. When <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Service" title="Metropolitan Police Service">Scotland Yard</a> is unable to find them, Pongo and Perdita use the "<a href="/wiki/Twilight_bark" title="Twilight bark">Twilight bark</a>", a canine gossip line, to ask for help from the other dogs in London.
</p><p>Colonel, an <a href="/wiki/Old_English_Sheepdog" title="Old English Sheepdog">Old English Sheepdog</a>, along with his compatriots Captain, a gray horse, and Sergeant Tibbs, a tabby cat, find the puppies in a place called Hell Hall (Cruella's abandoned and dilapidated family estate, also known as The De Vil Place), along with 84 other Dalmatian puppies that she had bought from various dog stores. When Tibbs learns they are going to be made into dog-skin <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fur_coat" title="Fur coat">fur coats</a>, Colonel quickly sends word back to London. Upon receiving the message, Pongo and Perdita leave town to retrieve their puppies. Winter has come, and they must cross the <a href="/wiki/River_Stour,_Suffolk" title="River Stour, Suffolk">Stour River</a> which is running fast and laden with slabs of broken ice. Meanwhile, Tibbs overhears Cruella ordering Jasper and Horace to kill the puppies that night out of fear the police will soon find them. In response, Tibbs attempts to rescue them while Jasper and Horace are preoccupied watching television, but they finish their show and come for them before he can get them out of the house. Pongo and Perdita break in and confront Jasper and Horace just as they are about to kill the puppies. While the adult dogs attack them, Colonel and Tibbs guide the puppies from the house.
</p><p>After a happy reunion with their own puppies, Pongo and Perdita realize there are dozens of others with them, 99 altogether including their own. Shocked at Cruella's plans, Pongo and Perdita decide to adopt all of the puppies, certain that Roger and Anita would never reject them. The Dalmatians begin making their way back to London through deep snow, as all open water is frozen solid. Other animals help them along the way, while Cruella, Jasper, and Horace chase them. In one town, they cover themselves with soot to disguise themselves as <a href="/wiki/Labrador_Retriever" title="Labrador Retriever">Labradors</a>, then pile inside a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Moving_van" title="Moving van">moving van</a> bound for London. As it is leaving, melting snow clears off the soot and Cruella sees them. Enraged, she follows the van in her car and rams it, but Jasper and Horace, who try to cut it off from above, end up crashing into her. Both vehicles are smashed to smithereens and fall into a deep ravine, leaving Cruella and her henchmen stranded and defeated at last. Cruella yells in frustration as the van drives away.
</p><p>Back in London, Roger and Anita are attempting to celebrate Christmas and his first big hit, a song about Cruella, but they miss their canine companions. Suddenly, barking is heard outside and, after their nanny opens the door, the house is filled with dogs. After wiping away the rest of the soot, they are delighted to realize their pets have returned home. After counting 84 extra puppies, they decide to use the money from the song to buy a large house in the country so they can keep all 101 Dalmatians.
</p><p>In the summer of 1957 in the <a href="/wiki/West_Side_(Manhattan)" title="West Side (Manhattan)">West Side</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Lincoln_Square,_Manhattan" title="Lincoln Square, Manhattan">Lincoln Square</a> neighborhood in <a href="/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, there is tension between a white American gang, the Jets, led by Riff, and a <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Ricans" title="Puerto Ricans">Puerto Rican</a> gang, the Sharks, led by Bernardo. After a brawl erupts, Lieutenant Schrank and Officer Krupke arrive and break it up. The Jets decide to challenge the Sharks to a rumble at an upcoming dance for neighborhood control.
</p><p>Riff decides that his best friend Tony, the co-founder of the Jets who left the gang, should fight. Riff invites Tony to the dance, but Tony is uninterested. He tells Riff that he senses something important will happen, which Riff suggests could have a correlation with the dance.
</p><p>Bernardo's younger sister, Maria, tells her best friend and Bernardo's girlfriend, Anita, how excited she is about the dance. At the dance, the gangs and girls refuse to intermingle. Tony arrives and he and Maria fall in love. However, Bernardo angrily demands Tony stay away from her. Riff proposes a meeting with Bernardo at Doc's drug store.
</p><p>Maria is sent home; Anita argues that Bernardo is overprotective of Maria and they compare the advantages of Puerto Rico and the United States.
</p><p>Tony discreetly visits Maria on her fire escape, where they reaffirm their love. Krupke, who suspects the Jets are planning something, visits them and warns them not to cause trouble. When the Sharks arrive, both groups agree to have the showdown the following evening under the highway, with a one-on-one fist fight. When Schrank arrives, the gangs feign friendship. Schrank orders the Sharks out and unsuccessfully tries to discover information about the fight.
</p><p>The next day at the bridal shop, Anita accidentally tells Maria about the rumble. Tony arrives to see Maria, which shocks Anita. They profess their love and Anita warns them about the consequences if Bernardo learns of their relationship. Maria has Tony promise to prevent the rumble. Tony and Maria fantasize about their wedding ceremony.
</p><p>The Jets and Sharks approach the area under the highway. Tony arrives to stop the fight, but Bernardo antagonizes him. Unwilling to watch Tony be humiliated, Riff initiates a knife fight. Tony tries to intervene, which leads to Bernardo killing Riff. Tony kills Bernardo with Riff's knife and a melee ensues. Police sirens blare and everyone flees, leaving behind the dead bodies.
</p><p>Maria waits for Tony on the rooftop of her apartment building when Chino arrives and tells her what happened. Tony arrives and explains what transpired and asks for her forgiveness before he turns himself in to the police. Maria confirms her love for him and asks Tony to stay with her.
</p><p>The Jets have reassembled outside a garage, with their new leader, Ice having them focus on reacting to the police. Anybodys arrives and warns them that Chino is now after Tony. Ice sends the Jets to warn Tony.
</p><p>Anita enters the apartment while Tony and Maria are in the bedroom. Tony and Maria arrange to meet at Doc's, where they will pick up getaway money to elope. Anita spots Tony leaving through the window and chides Maria for the relationship, but Maria convinces her to help them elope.
</p><p>Schrank arrives and questions Maria about the rumble. To cover for Tony, Maria has Anita tell him that Maria is detained from meeting him. When Anita reaches Doc's, the Jets harass her, until Doc intervenes. Anita declares that Bernardo was right about them and that Chino killed Maria. Doc banishes the Jets and gives Tony his getaway money in the basement and delivers Anita's message. Tony runs into the streets, shouting for Chino to kill him as well.
</p><p>In the playground next to Doc's, Tony spots Maria and they run toward each other, only for Chino to shoot Tony. The Jets and Sharks arrive to find Maria holding Tony, who dies. Maria stops the gangs from fighting and takes the gun from Chino and threatens to shoot everyone, blaming their hate for the deaths. Schrank, Krupke and Doc arrive and the gangs form a funeral procession, with Maria following. The police arrest Chino and lead him away.
</p><p>The film is presented in two parts, divided by an <a href="/wiki/Intermission#Films" title="Intermission">intermission</a>.
</p><p>The film opens in 1935 when Lawrence is killed in a motorcycle accident. At his memorial service at <a href="/wiki/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral" title="St Paul's Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>, a reporter tries (with little success) to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him.
</p><p>The story then moves backward to the <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">First World War</a>, where Lawrence is a misfit <a href="/wiki/British_Army" title="British Army">British Army</a> <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_(British_Army_and_Royal_Marines)" title="Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)">lieutenant</a>, notable for his insolence and education. Over the objections of <a href="/wiki/Archibald_Murray" title="Archibald Murray">General Murray</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mr._Dryden" title="Mr. Dryden">Mr. Dryden</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Arab_Bureau" title="Arab Bureau">Arab Bureau</a> sends him to assess the prospects of <a href="/wiki/Faisal_I_of_Iraq" title="Faisal I of Iraq">Prince Faisal</a> in <a href="/wiki/Arab_Revolt" title="Arab Revolt">his revolt</a> against the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Turks</a>. On the journey, his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bedouin_people" title="Bedouin people">Bedouin</a> guide, Tafas, is killed by Sherif Ali for drinking from his well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton, who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment, and leave. Lawrence ignores Brighton's orders when he meets Faisal. His outspokenness piques the prince's interest.
</p><p>Brighton advises Faisal to retreat after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Aqaba" title="Battle of Aqaba">surprise attack on Aqaba</a>; its capture would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. The town is strongly fortified against a naval assault but only lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical Sherif Ali. Teenage orphans Daud and Farraj attach themselves to Lawrence as servants. They cross the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nefud_Desert" title="Nefud Desert">Nefud Desert</a>, considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. One of Ali's men, Gasim, succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. When Lawrence discovers him missing, he turns back and rescues Gasim—and Sherif Ali is won over. He gives Lawrence Arab robes to wear.
</p><p>Lawrence persuades <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Auda_abu_Tayi" title="Auda abu Tayi">Auda abu Tayi</a>, the leader of the powerful local <a href="/wiki/Howeitat" title="Howeitat">Howeitat</a> tribe, to turn against the Turks. Lawrence's scheme is almost derailed when one of Ali's men kills one of Auda's because of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Blood_feud" title="Blood feud">blood feud</a>. Howeitat retaliation would shatter the fragile alliance, so Lawrence declares that he will execute the murderer himself. He is then stunned to discover that the culprit is Gasim, the very man whom he risked his own life to save in the desert, but he shoots him anyway.
</p><p>The next morning, the Arabs overrun the Turkish <a href="/wiki/Garrison" title="Garrison">garrison</a>. Lawrence heads to Cairo to inform Dryden and the new commander, <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Allenby,_1st_Viscount_Allenby" title="Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby">General Allenby</a>, of his victory. While crossing the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sinai_Desert" title="Sinai Desert">Sinai Desert</a>, Daud dies when he stumbles into <a href="/wiki/Dry_quicksand" title="Dry quicksand">quicksand</a>. Lawrence is promoted to <a href="/wiki/Major_(United_Kingdom)" title="Major (United Kingdom)">major</a> and given arms and money for the Arabs. He is deeply disturbed, however, confessing that he enjoyed executing Gasim, but Allenby brushes aside his qualms. He asks Allenby whether there is any basis for the Arabs' suspicions that the <a href="/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement" title="Sykes–Picot Agreement">British have designs on Arabia</a>. When pressed, the general states that they do not.
</p><p>Lawrence launches a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Guerrilla_war" title="Guerrilla war">guerrilla war</a>, blowing up trains and harassing the Turks at every turn. American <a href="/wiki/War_correspondent" title="War correspondent">war correspondent</a> Jackson Bentley publicises Lawrence's exploits, making him famous. On one raid, Farraj is badly injured. Unwilling to leave him to be tortured by the enemy, Lawrence shoots him dead before fleeing.
</p><p>When Lawrence scouts the enemy-held city of <a href="/wiki/Daraa" title="Daraa">Deraa</a> with Ali, he is taken, along with several Arab residents, to the Turkish <a href="/wiki/Bey" title="Bey">Bey</a>. Lawrence is stripped, ogled, and prodded. Then, for striking out at the Bey, he is severely <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flogging" title="Flogging">flogged</a> before being thrown into the street. The experience leaves Lawrence shaken. He returns to British headquarters in Cairo but does not fit in.
</p><p>A short time later in <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, General Allenby urges him to support the "big push" on <a href="/wiki/Damascus" title="Damascus">Damascus</a>. Lawrence hesitates to return but finally relents.
</p><p>Lawrence recruits an army that is motivated more by money than by the Arab cause. They sight a column of retreating Turkish soldiers who have just massacred the residents of <a href="/wiki/Tafas" title="Tafas">Tafas</a>. One of Lawrence's men is from Tafas; he demands, "No prisoners!" When Lawrence hesitates, the man charges the Turks alone and is killed. Lawrence takes up the dead man's battle cry; the result is a slaughter in which Lawrence himself participates. Afterwards, he regrets his actions.
</p><p>Lawrence's men take Damascus ahead of Allenby's forces. The Arabs set up a council to administer the city, but the desert tribesmen prove ill-suited for such a task. Despite Lawrence's efforts, they bicker constantly. Unable to maintain the public utilities, the Arabs soon abandon most of the city to the British.
</p><p>Lawrence is promoted to <a href="/wiki/Colonel_(United_Kingdom)" title="Colonel (United Kingdom)">colonel</a> and immediately ordered back to Britain, as his usefulness to both Faisal and the British is at an end. As he leaves the city, his automobile is passed by a motorcyclist who leaves a trail of dust in his wake.
</p><p>The film begins with narration by Spencer Tracy as the aerial-borne camera sweeps over the Rocky Mountains. "This land has a name today," says Tracy in the opening lines of the film, "and is marked on maps."
</p><p>The film then moves into "The Rivers" sequence (considerably to the east of the Rockies).
</p><p>Mountain man Linus Rawlings (Stewart) is making his way by horse and waterway through the mountains. He confers with a group of Indians. The scene then shifts to Zebulon Prescott and his family.
</p><p>Prescott (Malden) and his family set out west for the frontier via the <a href="/wiki/Erie_Canal" title="Erie Canal">Erie Canal</a>, the "West", at this time, being the <a href="/wiki/Ohio_River" title="Ohio River">Ohio River</a> country, at the <a href="/wiki/Battery_Rock" title="Battery Rock">southern edge</a> of <a href="/wiki/Illinois" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>. Along the journey, they meet Rawlings, who is traveling east, to <a href="/wiki/Pittsburgh" title="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, to trade his furs. Rawlings and Zebulon's daughter, Eve (<a href="/wiki/Carroll_Baker" title="Carroll Baker">Carroll Baker</a>), are attracted to each other, but Linus is not ready to settle down.
</p><p>Linus Rawlings stops at an isolated trading post, run by a murderous clan of <a href="/wiki/River_pirate" title="River pirate">river pirates</a>, headed by "Alabama Colonel" Jeb Hawkins (<a href="/wiki/Walter_Brennan" title="Walter Brennan">Walter Brennan</a>). Linus is betrayed when he accompanies seductive Dora Hawkins (<a href="/wiki/Brigid_Bazlen" title="Brigid Bazlen">Brigid Bazlen</a>), into a cave, modeled after a real outlaw haunt, now a part of <a href="/wiki/Cave-in-Rock_State_Park" title="Cave-in-Rock State Park">Cave-in-Rock State Park</a>, to see a "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Varmint" title="Varmint">varmint</a>". Dora Hawkins stabs him in the back and Rawlings falls into a deep hole. He is not seriously wounded, and he rescues the Prescott party from a similar fate. The bushwhacking thieves (<a href="/wiki/Lee_Van_Cleef" title="Lee Van Cleef">Lee Van Cleef</a> plays one), including Dora and Hawkins, are dispatched, being killed in an attack by Rawlings, in a form of rough frontier justice.
</p><p>After Zebulon prays to God for their lost loved ones and commends to Him the thieves' souls "whether You want 'em or not", the settlers continue down the river, but their raft is caught in <a href="/wiki/Rapids" title="Rapids">rapids</a>, and Zebulon and his wife Rebecca (<a href="/wiki/Agnes_Moorehead" title="Agnes Moorehead">Agnes Moorehead</a>) drown.

</p><p>The film is shot in the style of a docudrama, beginning in the days leading up to D-Day. It concentrates on events on both sides of the channel, such as the Allies waiting for a break in the poor weather and anticipating the reaction of the Axis forces defending northern France. The film pays particular attention to Gen. Eisenhower's decision to go, as Supreme Commander of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/SHAEF" title="SHAEF">SHAEF</a>, after reviewing the initial reports of bad weather and reports about the divisions within the <a href="/wiki/Oberkommando_des_Heeres" title="Oberkommando des Heeres">German High Command</a> as to where an invasion might happen or what their response should be.
</p><p>Numerous scenes document the early hours of June 6 when Allied airborne troops were sent in to take key locations inland from the beaches. The French resistance is also shown reacting to the news that an invasion has started. <i>The Longest Day</i> chronicles most of the important events surrounding D-Day, including the British glider missions to secure <a href="/wiki/Pegasus_Bridge" title="Pegasus Bridge">Pegasus Bridge</a>, the counterattacks launched by American paratroopers scattered around <a href="/wiki/Sainte-M%C3%A8re-%C3%89glise" title="Sainte-Mère-Église">Sainte-Mère-Église</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Operation_Jedburgh" title="Operation Jedburgh">infiltration and sabotage work</a> conducted by the French resistance and <a href="/wiki/Special_Operations_Executive" title="Special Operations Executive">SOE</a> agents, and the response by the <i><a href="/wiki/Wehrmacht" title="Wehrmacht">Wehrmacht</a></i> to the invasion and the uncertainty of German commanders as to whether it was a feint in preparation for crossings at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pas_de_Calais" title="Pas de Calais">Pas de Calais</a> (see <a href="/wiki/Operation_Fortitude" title="Operation Fortitude">Operation Fortitude</a>), where the senior German staff had always assumed that it would be.

</p><p>Cleopatra convinces Caesar to restore her throne from her younger brother. Caesar, in effective control of the kingdom, sentences <a href="/wiki/Pothinus" title="Pothinus">Pothinus</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gregoire_Aslan" title="Gregoire Aslan">Gregoire Aslan</a>) to death for arranging an assassination attempt on Cleopatra, and banishes Ptolemy to the eastern desert, where he and his outnumbered army would face certain death against <a href="/wiki/Mithridates_III_of_Parthia" title="Mithridates III of Parthia">Mithridates</a>. Cleopatra is crowned <a href="/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom#Final_years_of_the_empire" title="Ptolemaic Kingdom">Queen of Egypt</a>, and begins to develop megalomaniacal dreams of ruling the world with Caesar, who in turn desires to become King of <a href="/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>. They marry, and when their son <a href="/wiki/Caesarion" title="Caesarion">Caesarion</a> is born, Caesar accepts him publicly, which becomes the talk of Rome and the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Senate" title="Roman Senate">Senate</a>.
</p><p>After he is made <a href="/wiki/Roman_dictator" title="Roman dictator">dictator</a> for life, Caesar sends for Cleopatra. She arrives in Rome in a lavish procession and wins the adulation of the Roman people. The Senate grows increasingly discontented amid rumors that Caesar wishes to be made king, which is anathema to the Romans. On the <a href="/wiki/Ides_of_March" title="Ides of March">Ides of March</a> in 44 BC, a group of conspirators <a href="/wiki/Assassination_of_Julius_Caesar" title="Assassination of Julius Caesar">assassinate Caesar</a> and flee the city, starting a rebellion. An <a href="/wiki/Second_Triumvirate" title="Second Triumvirate">alliance</a> between <a href="/wiki/Augustus" title="Augustus">Octavian</a>, Caesar's adopted son, <a href="/wiki/Mark_Antony" title="Mark Antony">Mark Antony</a> (<a href="/wiki/Richard_Burton" title="Richard Burton">Richard Burton</a>), Caesar's right-hand man and general as well as <a href="/wiki/Marcus_Aemilius_Lepidus_(triumvir)" title="Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)">Marcus Ameilius Lepidus</a> put down the rebellion and split up the republic between themselves. Cleopatra is angered after Caesar's will recognizes Octavian instead of Caesarion as his official heir, and angrily returns to Egypt.
</p><p>While planning a campaign against <a href="/wiki/Parthian_Empire" title="Parthian Empire">Parthia</a> in the east, Antony realizes he needs money and supplies, and cannot get enough from anywhere but Egypt. After refusing several times to leave Egypt, Cleopatra gives in and meets him in <a href="/wiki/Tarsus,_Mersin" title="Tarsus, Mersin">Tarsus</a>. The two begin a love affair, with Cleopatra assuring Anthony that he is much more than a pale reflection of Caesar.
</p><p>Octavian's removal of Lepidus forces Anthony to return to Rome, where he marries Octavian's sister, <a href="/wiki/Octavia_the_Younger" title="Octavia the Younger">Octavia</a>, to prevent conflict, much to Cleopatra's distraughtness and enragement. Anthony and Cleopatra reconcile and marry, with Anthony divorcing Octavia. Octavian, incensed, reads Anthony's will to the Roman senate, revealing that the latter wishes to be buried in Egypt. Rome turns against Anthony, and Octavian's call for war against Egypt receives a rapturous response.
</p><p>The war is decided at the naval <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Actium" title="Battle of Actium">Battle of Actium</a> on September 2, 31 BC, where Octavian's fleet, under the command of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Agrippa,_Marcus_Vipsanius" title="Agrippa, Marcus Vipsanius">Agrippa</a>, defeats the Antony-Egyptian fleet. Cleopatra assumes Antony is dead and orders the Egyptian forces home. Antony follows, leaving his fleet leaderless and soon defeated.
</p><p>Several months later, Cleopatra manages to convince Antony to retake command of his troops and fight Octavian's advancing army. However, Antony's soldiers abandon him during the night; <a href="/wiki/Rufio_(officer_of_Caesar)" title="Rufio (officer of Caesar)">Rufio</a> (<a href="/wiki/Martin_Landau" title="Martin Landau">Martin Landau</a>), the last man loyal to Antony, kills himself. Antony tries to goad Octavian into single combat, but is finally forced to flee into the city.
</p><p>When Antony returns to the palace, <a href="/wiki/Apollodorus_the_Sicilian" title="Apollodorus the Sicilian">Apollodorus</a>, not believing that Antony is worthy of his queen, convinces him that she is dead, whereupon Antony falls on his own sword. Apollodorus then confesses that he misled Antony and assists him to the tomb where Cleopatra and two servants have taken refuge. Antony dies in Cleopatra's arms.
</p><p>Octavian and his army march into <a href="/wiki/Alexandria" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> with Caesarion's dead body in a wagon. He discovers the dead body of Apollodorus, who had poisoned himself. Octavian receives word that Antony is dead and Cleopatra is holed up in a tomb. There he offers her his word that he will allow her to rule Egypt as a Roman province in return for her agreeing to accompany him to Rome. Cleopatra knows her son is dead and agrees to Octavian's terms, including a pledge not to harm herself. 
</p><p>After Octavian departs, she orders her servants in coded language to assist with her suicide. Octavian realizes that she is going to kill herself and he and his guards burst into Cleopatra's chamber and find her dressed in gold, and dead, along with her servants, while an <a href="/wiki/Asp_(reptile)" title="Asp (reptile)">asp</a> crawls along the floor.
</p><p>Seeking to exact revenge on James Bond (007) for killing its agent <a href="/wiki/Julius_No" title="Julius No">Dr. No</a> and destroying the organisation's assets in the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, the international criminal organisation <a href="/wiki/SPECTRE" title="SPECTRE">SPECTRE</a> begins training agents to kill Bond. Their star pupil is Donald "Red" Grant, an Irish assassin who proves his mettle by killing a Bond impostor in one minute and fifty-two seconds on a training course with a garrote wire concealed in his wristwatch.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the organisation's Chief Planner, a <a href="/wiki/Czechoslovak_Socialist_Republic" title="Czechoslovak Socialist Republic">Czech</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chess_grandmaster" title="Chess grandmaster">chess grandmaster</a> named Kronsteen (Number 5), devises a plan to play British and Soviet intelligence against each other to procure a Lektor <a href="/wiki/Cryptography" title="Cryptography">cryptographic</a> device from the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviets</a>. SPECTRE's Chief Executive, <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld" title="Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Number 1</a>, puts <a href="/wiki/Rosa_Klebb" title="Rosa Klebb">Rosa Klebb</a> (Number 3), a former Colonel of <a href="/wiki/SMERSH" title="SMERSH">SMERSH</a> (the counter-intelligence branch of Soviet Intelligence) who has defected to SPECTRE in the West, in charge of the mission as Chief of Operations. Klebb chooses Grant to protect Bond until he acquires the Lektor and then to eliminate 007 and steal the cipher machine for SPECTRE. As part of the scheme, Klebb recruits the beautiful <a href="/wiki/Tatiana_Romanova" title="Tatiana Romanova">Tatiana Romanova</a>, a cipher clerk at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/USSR" title="USSR">Soviet</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Consulate" title="Consulate">consulate</a> in <a href="/wiki/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, who believes the ex-Colonel still to be working for SMERSH.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" title="M (James Bond)">M</a> informs Bond that Romanova has contacted their "Station 'T'" in <a href="/wiki/Turkey" title="Turkey">Turkey</a>, claiming to have fallen in love with Bond from his file photo. She offers to defect to the West, and will bring a top secret Lektor with her to sweeten the deal but only on the condition that Bond handle her case, personally. Prior to his departure, Bond is supplied by <a href="/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)" title="Q (James Bond)">Q</a> with an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Attach%C3%A9_case" title="Attaché case">attaché case</a> containing a concealed throwing knife, gold sovereigns, a special <a href="/wiki/Tear_gas" title="Tear gas">tear gas</a> booby trap connected to the lock mechanism and ammunition for an <a href="/wiki/ArmaLite_AR-7" title="ArmaLite AR-7">ArmaLite AR-7</a> folding sniper rifle with an infrared night scope.
</p><p>After travelling to <a href="/wiki/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, Bond heads into the city to meet with station head <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_allies_in_From_Russia_with_Love#Ali_Kerim_Bey" title="List of James Bond allies in From Russia with Love">Ali Kerim Bey</a>, tailed by <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Bulgaria" title="People's Republic of Bulgaria">Bulgarian</a> secret agents working for the Russians. They are in turn tailed by Grant, who kills one of them after Bond is taken back to his hotel, stealing their car and dumping it outside the Soviet Consulate in order to provoke hostilities between British and Soviet Intelligence. In response, the Soviets bomb Kerim's office with a <a href="/wiki/Limpet_mine" title="Limpet mine">limpet mine</a>; Kerim, however, is away from his desk for a tryst with his mistress. He and Bond then investigate the attack by spying on a Soviet consulate meeting through a periscope installed in the underground aqueducts beneath Istanbul. Thus, they learn that the Soviet agent Krilencu is responsible for the bombing. Kerim Bey declares it unwise to stay in the city under such circumstances and takes Bond to a rural <a href="/wiki/Romani_people" title="Romani people">gypsy</a> settlement. However, Krilencu learns of this and promptly attacks a Gypsy feast, where Bond and Kerim are honoured guests, with a band of hired Bulgarian fighters. Much to Bond's confusion, he is saved from an enemy fighter during the attack by a distant sniper shot from Grant. The following night, Bond and Kerim Bey track Krilencu down to his hideout, where Kerim Bey kills him with Bond's rifle.
</p><p>Upon returning to his hotel suite that night, Bond finds Romanova waiting for him in his bed and has sex with her; neither is aware that SPECTRE is filming them. The next day, Romanova heads off for a prearranged rendezvous at <a href="/wiki/Hagia_Sophia" title="Hagia Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a> to drop off the floor plans for the consulate, with Grant ensuring Bond receives the plans by killing the other Bulgarian tail who attempts to intercept the drop. Using the plans, Bond and Kerim Bey successfully steal the Lektor and, together with Romanova, escape with the device onto the <a href="/wiki/Orient_Express" title="Orient Express">Orient Express</a>. On the train, Kerim Bey quickly notices a Soviet security officer named Benz tailing them, prompting him and Bond to subdue him. When Bond leaves Benz and Kerim Bey alone together, Grant kills them and makes it appear as though they killed each other, preventing Bond from leaving the train with Romanova to rendezvous with one of Kerim's men.
</p><p>At the railway station in <a href="/wiki/Belgrade" title="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, Bond passes on word of Kerim Bey's death to one of his sons, and asks for an agent from <a href="/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia" title="Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">Station Y</a> to meet him at <a href="/wiki/Zagreb" title="Zagreb">Zagreb</a>. However, when the train arrives at the station, Grant intercepts Nash, sent from Station Y, killing the agent before posing as him. After drugging Romanova at dinner, Grant overpowers Bond before taunting him about SPECTRE's involvement in the theft. After disclosing that Romanova was unaware of what was truly going on, believing she was working for Russia, Grant reveals to Bond his plans to leave behind the film SPECTRE took of him and Romanova at the hotel, along with a forged blackmail letter, to make it appear that their deaths were the result of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Murder-suicide" title="Murder-suicide">murder-suicide</a>, to scandalise the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_intelligence_community" title="British intelligence community">intelligence community</a>. Bond quickly convinces him to accept a bribe of gold sovereigns in exchange for a final cigarette, tricking Grant into setting off the booby trap in his attaché case. This distracts Grant enough for Bond to attack him in a brutal brawl. In the ensuing fight, Bond narrowly gains the upper hand, stabbing Grant with the case's concealed knife before strangling him with his own <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Garrotte" title="Garrotte">garrotte</a>. Bond then drags the barely conscious Romanova from the train, which has been stopped by a SPECTRE accomplice, where he hijacks Grant's getaway truck and flees the scene with Romanova.
</p><p>Upon hearing the news of Grant's death, Number 1 calls Klebb and Kronsteen onto the carpet to explain what went wrong and remind them that SPECTRE does not tolerate failure. Kronsteen is executed by the henchman Morzeny with a kick from the poison-tipped switchblade in his shoe. Klebb, however, is given one last chance to make good on the mission and acquire the Lektor (which has already been promised to the Russians in a sell-back scheme).
</p><p>The next morning, Bond's stolen truck is intercepted along its escape route by a SPECTRE helicopter, but 007 destroys the attacking aircraft by shooting its co-pilot with his sniper rifle, causing the man to drop a live hand grenade in the cockpit. Thus, Bond and Romanova make it to Grant's escape boat on the <a href="/wiki/Dalmatia" title="Dalmatia">Dalmatian coast</a> and steal that, too, only to be pursued by Morzeny, who leads a squadron of SPECTRE powerboats. Bond, however, escapes by dumping his own powerboat's fuel drums overboard and detonating them with a <a href="/wiki/Flare_gun" title="Flare gun">Very flare</a> to engulf all the chase boats in a sea of flames.
</p><p>Eventually, he and Romanova reach a hotel in <a href="/wiki/Venice" title="Venice">Venice</a>, where they believe themselves to be safe. Klebb, however, disguised as a maid, makes one final attempt on Bond and the Lektor. Klebb tries to kick him with a poisoned switchblade shoe, but Romanova shoots her with her own dropped gun. With the mission accomplished, Bond and Romanova leave Venice on a romantic boat ride, in which course Bond throws Grant's blackmail film into the canal.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, Professor Henry Higgins (<a href="/wiki/Rex_Harrison" title="Rex Harrison">Rex Harrison</a>), a scholar of <a href="/wiki/Phonetics" title="Phonetics">phonetics</a>, believes that the accent and tone of one's voice determines a person's prospects in society ("Why Can't the English?"). At <a href="/wiki/Covent_Garden" title="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</a> one evening, he meets Colonel Hugh Pickering (<a href="/wiki/Wilfrid_Hyde-White" title="Wilfrid Hyde-White">Wilfrid Hyde-White</a>), himself a phonetics expert who had come all the way from India to see him. Higgins boasts he could teach anyone to speak so well he could pass them off as a duke or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Duchess" title="Duchess">duchess</a> at an embassy <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ball_(dance)" title="Ball (dance)">ball</a>, even the young woman with a strong <a href="/wiki/Cockney" title="Cockney">Cockney</a> accent named Eliza Doolittle (<a href="/wiki/Audrey_Hepburn" title="Audrey Hepburn">Audrey Hepburn</a>) who tries to <a href="/wiki/Flower_seller" title="Flower seller">sell them flowers</a>. Eliza's ambition is to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible ("Wouldn't It Be Loverly"). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins' home, seeking lessons. Pickering is intrigued and offers to cover all the attendant expenses if Higgins succeeds. Higgins agrees, and describes how women ruin lives ("I'm an Ordinary Man").
</p><p>Eliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle (<a href="/wiki/Stanley_Holloway" title="Stanley Holloway">Stanley Holloway</a>), a <a href="/wiki/Waste_collector" title="Waste collector">dustman</a>, learns of his daughter's new residence ("With a Little Bit of Luck"). He shows up at Higgins' house three days later, ostensibly to protect his daughter's virtue, but in reality simply to extract some money from Higgins, and is bought off with £5. Higgins is impressed by the man's honesty, his natural gift for language, and especially his brazen lack of morals. Higgins recommends Alfred to a wealthy American who is interested in morality. 
</p><p>Eliza endures Higgins' demanding teaching methods and treatment of her personally ("Just You Wait"). She makes little progress, but just as she, Higgins, and Pickering are about to give up, Eliza finally "gets it" ("The Rain in Spain"); she instantly begins to speak with an impeccable <a href="/wiki/Received_Pronunciation" title="Received Pronunciation">upper class accent</a> ("I Could Have Danced All Night").
</p><p>As a trial run, Higgins takes her to <a href="/wiki/Ascot_Racecourse" title="Ascot Racecourse">Ascot Racecourse</a> ("Ascot Gavotte"), where she makes a good impression initially, only to shock everyone by a sudden lapse into vulgar Cockney while cheering on a horse. Higgins partly conceals a grin behind his hand. At Ascot, she meets Freddy Eynsford-Hill (<a href="/wiki/Jeremy_Brett" title="Jeremy Brett">Jeremy Brett</a>), a young, upper-class man who becomes infatuated with her ("On the Street Where You Live"). Higgins then takes Eliza to an embassy ball for the final test, where she dances with a foreign prince. Zoltan <a href="/wiki/Carpathian_Mountains" title="Carpathian Mountains">Karpathy</a> (<a href="/wiki/Theodore_Bikel" title="Theodore Bikel">Theodore Bikel</a>), a Hungarian phonetics expert trained by Higgins, converses briefly with Eliza, then certifies that she is not only Hungarian, but a princess.
</p><p>However, Eliza's hard work is barely acknowledged, with all the praise going to Higgins ("You Did It").  This and his callous treatment towards her afterwards, especially his indifference to her future, causes her to walk out on him, leaving him mystified by her ingratitude ("Just You Wait (Reprise)"). Outside, Freddy is still waiting ("On the Street Where You Live (Reprise)"), and greets Eliza, who is irritated by him as all he does is talk ("Show Me"). Eliza tries to return to her old life, but finds that she no longer fits in. She meets her father, who has been left a large fortune by the wealthy American to whom Higgins had recommended him, and is resigned to marrying Eliza's stepmother. Alfred feels that Higgins has ruined him, lamenting that he is now bound by "middle-class morality" ("Get Me to the Church On Time"). Eliza eventually ends up visiting Higgins' mother (<a href="/wiki/Gladys_Cooper" title="Gladys Cooper">Gladys Cooper</a>), who is outraged at her son's callous behaviour.
</p><p>The next day, Higgins finds Eliza gone and searches for her ("A Hymn to Him"), eventually finding her at his mother's house. Higgins attempts to talk Eliza into coming back to him. He becomes angered when she announces that she is going to marry Freddy and become Karpathy's assistant ("Without You"). He makes his way home, stubbornly predicting that she will come crawling back. However, he comes to the unsettling realization that she has become an important part of his life ("I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face"). As he listens to a recording of Eliza's voice, she reappears in the doorway behind him, turning off the recording and saying in her old Cockney accent, "I washed my hands and face before I come, I did."  Higgins looks surprised, then pleased, before asking where his slippers are.
</p><p>After destroying a <a href="/wiki/Clandestine_chemistry" title="Clandestine chemistry">drug laboratory</a> in <a href="/wiki/Latin_America" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mi6" title="Mi6">MI6</a> agent James Bond travels to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Miami_Beach" title="Miami Beach">Miami Beach</a> for a vacation.  He receives instructions from his superior, <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" title="M (James Bond)">M</a>, via CIA agent <a href="/wiki/Felix_Leiter" title="Felix Leiter">Felix Leiter</a> to observe bullion dealer <a href="/wiki/Auric_Goldfinger" title="Auric Goldfinger">Auric Goldfinger</a> at the hotel there. Bond sees Goldfinger cheating at <a href="/wiki/Gin_rummy" title="Gin rummy">gin rummy</a> and stops him by distracting his employee, Jill Masterson, and <a href="/wiki/Blackmail" title="Blackmail">blackmailing</a> Goldfinger into losing. After Bond and Jill consummate their new relationship, Bond is knocked out by Goldfinger's <a href="/wiki/North_Korea" title="North Korea">Korean</a> manservant <a href="/wiki/Oddjob" title="Oddjob">Oddjob</a>. When Bond awakens, he finds Jill dead, covered in gold paint, having died from "skin suffocation."

To help in his mission, Bond is given a modified <a href="/wiki/Aston_Martin_DB5" title="Aston Martin DB5">Aston Martin DB5</a> and two radar trackers by <a href="/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)" title="Q (James Bond)">Q</a>. Bond arranges to meet Goldfinger socially at his country club in <a href="/wiki/Kent" title="Kent">Kent</a>, and wins a high-stakes <a href="/wiki/Golf" title="Golf">golf</a> game against him with a recovered <a href="/wiki/Nazi_gold" title="Nazi gold">Nazi gold</a> bar at stake. Aware of Bond’s ulterior motives, Goldfinger warns Bond not to interfere in his affairs, reinforcing the threat by having Oddjob demonstrate his steel-rimmed derby as a deadly weapon. Bond follows Goldfinger to <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, where Tilly, Jill's sister, attempts to avenge her sister by assassinating Goldfinger with a rifle and fails.

Bond also overhears Goldfinger talking to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="People's Republic of China">Chinese</a> nuclear physicist Mr. Ling about "Operation Grand Slam." Leaving, Bond encounters Tilly as she tries to kill Goldfinger again, but trips an alarm in the process. Oddjob kills Tilly with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oddjob%27s_hat" title="Oddjob's hat">his hat</a>, and Bond is captured and tied to a cutting table underneath an industrial <a href="/wiki/Laser" title="Laser">laser</a>, which begins to slice a large sheet of gold in half, with Bond lying over it. He then lies to Goldfinger that <a href="/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service" title="Secret Intelligence Service">MI6</a> knows about Grand Slam, causing Goldfinger to spare Bond's life to mislead MI6 into believing Bond has things in hand.
</p><p>Bond is transported by Goldfinger's private jet, piloted by <a href="/wiki/Pussy_Galore" title="Pussy Galore">Pussy Galore</a>, to his <a href="/wiki/Stud_farm" title="Stud farm">stud farm</a> in <a href="/wiki/Lexington,_Kentucky" title="Lexington, Kentucky">Lexington,</a> <a href="/wiki/Kentucky" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. Bond escapes and witnesses Goldfinger's meeting with <a href="/wiki/American_Mafia" title="American Mafia">American mafiosi</a>, who have brought the materials he needs for Operation Grand Slam. Goldfinger reveals that his plan is to rob the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Bullion_Depository" title="United States Bullion Depository">U.S. Bullion Depository</a> at <a href="/wiki/Fort_Knox" title="Fort Knox">Fort Knox</a> by releasing <a href="/wiki/Neurotoxin" title="Neurotoxin">Delta 9 nerve gas</a> into the atmosphere. After Bond is recaptured by Pussy, Goldfinger has the mafiosi killed using the gas. 
</p><p>Bond points out to Goldfinger that his plan to rob the depository will not work, as he will not have enough time to move the gold before the Americans intervene. Goldfinger hints he does not intend to steal the gold, and Bond deduces that Goldfinger will detonate a <a href="/wiki/Dirty_bomb" title="Dirty bomb">dirty bomb</a> inside the vault, designed to render the gold useless for 58 years. This will increase the value of Goldfinger's own gold and give the Chinese an advantage from the potential economic chaos. Goldfinger subtly threatens that should the Americans attempt to locate the bomb or interfere with his plan, he will simply have it detonated somewhere else of significance in the United States. 
</p><p>Operation Grand Slam begins with Pussy Galore's Flying Circus spraying the gas over Fort Knox, seemingly killing all of the military and government personnel nearby including Felix. Goldfinger's private army breaks into Fort Knox and accesses the vault as Goldfinger arrives in a helicopter with the atomic device. In the vault, his henchman Kisch handcuffs Bond to the bomb. Unbeknownst to Goldfinger however, Bond has convinced Galore to alert the Americans and replace the gas with a harmless substance. The troops arise and attack, killing many of Goldfinger's men. Seeing this, Goldfinger locks the vault, takes off his coat, revealing a US Army colonel's uniform, and kills Mr. Ling and several troops, before escaping. Kisch realizes they are trapped and attempts to stop the bomb, but Oddjob throws him to his death. Bond frees himself with Kisch's handcuff keys, but the superhumanly strong Oddjob batters him before he can disarm the bomb. Eventually Bond manages to electrocute Oddjob, then forces the lock off the bomb using gold bullion bars from the vault, but ultimately is unable to disarm it. After finally killing all of Goldfinger's men, the troops open the vault and rush to disarm the bomb. An atomic specialist who accompanied Leiter arrives with seconds to spare, and simply turns off the device with the timer stopped on "0:07".
</p><p>Bond is invited to the <a href="/wiki/White_House" title="White House">White House</a> for lunch with the President. However, Goldfinger hijacks the plane carrying Bond there. In a struggle for Goldfinger's revolver, the gun fires, shooting out a window, creating an <a href="/wiki/Uncontrolled_decompression#Explosive_decompression" title="Uncontrolled decompression">explosive decompression</a>. Goldfinger is blown out of the cabin through the ruptured window. With the plane out of control, Bond rescues Galore and they parachute safely from the aircraft before it crashes into the ocean. A search helicopter passes, but Bond claims “this is no time to be rescued” and draws the parachute over himself and Galore.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Edwardian_era" title="Edwardian era">Edwardian</a> <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, 1910, Bert entertains a crowd as a <a href="/wiki/One-man_band" title="One-man band">one-man band</a> when he senses a change in the wind. Afterwards, he <a href="/wiki/Fourth_wall" title="Fourth wall">directly addresses the audience</a>, and gives them a tour of Cherry Tree Lane, stopping outside the Banks family's home. George Banks returns home to learn from his wife, Winifred, that Katie Nanna has left their service after Jane and Michael ran away again. They are returned shortly after by Constable Jones, who reveals the children were chasing a lost kite. The children ask their father to help build a better kite, but he dismisses them. Taking it upon himself to hire a new nanny, Mr. Banks advertises for a stern, no-nonsense nanny. Instead, Jane and Michael present their own advertisement for a kinder, sweeter nanny. Mr. Banks rips up the letter, and throws the scraps in the fireplace, but the remains of the advertisement magically float up, and out into the air.
</p><p>The next day, a number of elderly, sour-faced nannies wait outside the Banks' home, but a strong gust of wind blows them away, and Jane and Michael witness a young nanny descending from the sky using her umbrella. Presenting herself to Mr. Banks, <a href="/wiki/Mary_Poppins_(character)" title="Mary Poppins (character)">Mary Poppins</a> calmly produces the children's restored advertisement, and agrees with its requests, but promises the astonished banker she will be firm with his children. As Mr. Banks puzzles over the advertisement's return, Mary Poppins hires herself, and convinces him it was originally his idea. She meets the children, then helps them tidy their nursery through song, before heading out for a walk in the park.
</p><p>Outside, they meet Bert, working as a <a href="/wiki/Street_painting" title="Street painting">screever</a>; Mary Poppins uses her magic to transport the group into one of his drawings. While the children ride on a <a href="/wiki/Carousel" title="Carousel">carousel</a>, Mary Poppins and Bert go on a leisurely stroll. Mary Poppins later enchants the carousel horses, and participates in a horse race, which she wins. While being asked to describe her victory, Mary Poppins announces the nonsense word "<a href="/wiki/Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" title="Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious">Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</a>". However, the outing is ruined when a thunderstorm dissolves Bert's drawings, returning the group to London.
</p><p>On another outing, the four meet Uncle Albert, who has floated up in the air due to his uncontrollable laughter; they join him for a tea party on the ceiling, telling jokes.
</p><p>Mr. Banks becomes annoyed by the household's cheery atmosphere, and threatens to fire Mary Poppins. Instead, Mary Poppins inverts his attempt by convincing him to take the children to the bank for a day. Mr. Banks takes Jane and Michael to the bank, where they meet Mr. Dawes Sr, and his son. Mr. Dawes aggressively attempts to have Michael invest his <a href="/wiki/Twopence_(British_pre-decimal_coin)" title="Twopence (British pre-decimal coin)">tuppence</a> in the bank, snatching it from him. Michael demands it back, causing other customers to misinterpret, and all demand their own money back, causing a <a href="/wiki/Bank_run" title="Bank run">bank run</a>.
</p><p>Jane and Michael flee the bank, getting lost in the <a href="/wiki/East_End_of_London" title="East End of London">East End</a> until they run into Bert, now working as a <a href="/wiki/Chimney_sweep" title="Chimney sweep">chimney sweep</a>, who escorts them home. The three and Mary Poppins venture onto the rooftops, where they have a song-and-dance number with other chimney sweeps, which spills out into the Banks' home. An incensed Mr. Banks returns, and receives a phone call from his employers. He speaks with Bert, who tells him he should spend more time with his children before they grow up. Jane and Michael give their father Michael's tuppence in the hope to make amends.
</p><p>Mr. Banks walks through London to the bank, where he is given a humiliating <a href="/wiki/Cashiering" title="Cashiering">cashiering</a>, and is dismissed. Looking to the tuppence for words, he blurts out "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!", tells one of Uncle Albert's jokes, and happily heads home. Dawes mulls over the joke, but finally "gets" it, and floats up into the air, laughing.
</p><p>The next day, the wind changes, meaning Mary Poppins must leave. A happier Mr. Banks is found at home, having fixed his children's kite, and takes the family out to fly it. In the park, the Bankses meet Mr. Dawes Jr, who reveals his father <a href="/wiki/Death_from_laughter" title="Death from laughter">died laughing</a> from the joke, and re-employs Mr. Banks as a junior partner. With her work done, Mary Poppins flies away, with Bert bidding her farewell, telling her not to stay away too long.
</p><p>In 1938, Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman studying to become a nun at <a href="/wiki/Nonnberg_Abbey" title="Nonnberg Abbey">Nonnberg Abbey</a> in <a href="/wiki/Salzburg" title="Salzburg">Salzburg</a>. Her love of music and the mountains, her youthful enthusiasm and imagination, and her lack of discipline cause some concern among the nuns. The Mother Abbess, believing Maria would be happier outside the abbey, sends her to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children—Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. Liesl, the oldest, is won over after Maria protects her from discovery when she is nearly caught sneaking back into the house after meeting with Rolfe, a messenger boy she is in love with.
</p><p>While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children and takes them around Salzburg and the surrounding mountains, and teaches them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend, Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake that concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities, and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain orders her to return to the abbey. Just then he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. Afterwards, he apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay.
</p><p>Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes he enter them in the upcoming <a href="/wiki/Salzburg_Festival" title="Salzburg Festival">Salzburg Festival</a> but the suggestion is immediately rejected by the Captain as he is opposed to his children singing in public. He does agree, however, to organize a grand party at the villa. The night of the party, while guests in formal attire <a href="/wiki/Waltz" title="Waltz">waltz</a> in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional <i><a href="/wiki/L%C3%A4ndler" title="Ländler">Ländler</a></i> folk dance, he cuts in and dances with Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy while convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. Back at the abbey, when Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her life. After Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. The Captain's feelings for Maria, however, have not changed, and after breaking off his engagement the Captain marries Maria.
</p><p>While the Captain and Maria are on their honeymoon, Max enters the children in the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. When they learn that Austria has been annexed by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Third_Reich" title="Third Reich">Third Reich</a> in the <i><a href="/wiki/Anschluss" title="Anschluss">Anschluss</a></i>, the couple return to their home, where a telegram awaits informing the Captain that he must report to the German Naval base at <a href="/wiki/Bremerhaven" title="Bremerhaven">Bremerhaven</a> to accept a commission in the <a href="/wiki/Kriegsmarine" title="Kriegsmarine">German Navy</a>. Strongly opposed to the Nazis and the <i>Anschluss</i>, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately for <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. Many of the Von Trapps' friends are prepared to accept the new regime, including Rolfe, whom Liesl is devastated to see has joined the <a href="/wiki/Hitler_Youth" title="Hitler Youth">Hitler Youth</a>. That night, as the von Trapp family attempt to leave, they are stopped by a group of <a href="/wiki/Sturmabteilung" title="Sturmabteilung">Brownshirts</a> waiting outside the villa. When questioned by <i><a href="/wiki/Gauleiter" title="Gauleiter">Gauleiter</a></i> Hans Zeller, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven.
</p><p>Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slip away and seek shelter at the nearby abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Brownshirts soon arrive and search the abbey, and the family is discovered by Rolfe. Upon seeing Liesl, he hesitates raising the alarm long enough to allow the family time to flee, and the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When the soldiers attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start as two nuns have removed parts of the engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom.
</p><p>The film<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> consists of five main sections: <a href="/wiki/Genesis_creation_narrative" title="Genesis creation narrative">The Creation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Adam_and_Eve" title="Adam and Eve">Adam and Eve</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cain_and_Abel" title="Cain and Abel">Cain and Abel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark" title="Noah's Ark">Noah's Ark</a>, and the story of <a href="/wiki/Abraham" title="Abraham">Abraham</a>. There are also a pair of shorter sections, one recounting the building of the <a href="/wiki/Tower_of_Babel" title="Tower of Babel">Tower of Babel</a>, and the other the destruction of <a href="/wiki/Sodom_and_Gomorrah" title="Sodom and Gomorrah">Sodom and Gomorrah</a>. The sections vary greatly in tone. The story of Abraham is somber and reverential, while that of Noah repeatedly focuses on his love of all animals. Cats (including lions) are shown drinking milk and Noah's relationship with the animals is depicted as harmonious. It was originally conceived as the first in a series of films retelling the entire <a href="/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>, but these sequels were never made.
</p><p>In 1819, young Prince Keoki Kanakoa from the <a href="/wiki/Hawaiian_Islands" title="Hawaiian Islands">Islands of Hawaii</a> makes an appeal at the <a href="/wiki/Yale_Divinity_School" title="Yale Divinity School">Yale Divinity School</a> for newly graduated ministers to return with him to Hawaii and convert the natives to Christianity. Reverend Abner Hale is among those who volunteer for the mission. Before being sent to Hawaii, the young ministers must marry — a problem for Abner as he has zealously devoted himself to his studies and does not know any marriageable young women, partly because he has been raised in a strict, cold <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Calvinist" title="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> household where romance or pleasure, even between a married couple, is considered sinful. The head of the school, Reverend Dr. Thorn, introduces Abner to his niece, Jerusha Bromley, a beautiful and pious New England girl who has been pining for Captain Rafer Hoxworth, a whaler who has been at sea for two years and has not written to her. Although Jerusha's parents are not enthused about her marrying the awkward Abner, her uncle persuades them to give him a chance, and also hides the package of letters from Hoxworth that appear at the Bromley home just as Abner arrives. 
</p><p>Abner is stunned by Jerusha's beauty, and attracted to her despite his attempts to avoid what he considers sinful thoughts, but he completely lacks social graces and makes one embarrassing gaffe after another. Despite this, Jerusha encourages him, and he finally proposes and she accepts, with the understanding that they will both be going on mission to Hawaii. The Hales depart for Hawaii with the other missionaries and Keoki, and after a harrowing sea voyage during which all but Abner are very seasick and the ship almost wrecks going around <a href="/wiki/Cape_Horn" title="Cape Horn">Cape Horn</a> in southern <a href="/wiki/Chile" title="Chile">Chile</a>, they arrive in Keoki's hometown of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lahaina" title="Lahaina">Lahaina</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maui" title="Maui">Maui</a>, where they stop before most of the missionaries continue on to the main church at <a href="/wiki/Honolulu" title="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>. The missionaries are horrified to see what they consider the islanders' sinful ways. Naked young girls swim out to meet the ships and have sexual relations with the sailors; monuments are dedicated to the traditional gods; and Keoki's father Kelolo is both the husband and the biological brother of Keoki's mother Malama Kanakoa, the <a href="/wiki/Ali%CA%BBi" title="Aliʻi">Aliʻi Nui</a> (ruler) whom the natives consider a "sacred person". The Ali'i Nui must marry her brother to avoid polluting the bloodline of the ruling family, and Keoki is expected to also marry his sister Noelani when she succeeds Malama as Ali'i Nui. However, Keoki is willing to forego this in order to become what he truly wants to be, an ordained Christian minister. 
</p><p>Malama takes a liking to Jerusha and demands that Jerusha teach her to write English, so she can communicate with the outside world. Malama agrees to learn about the Christian God, but only after she learns to write. When the other missionaries continue on to Honolulu, the Hales stay behind, living in an uncomfortable hut and building a church. Jerusha tries to change the villagers' tradition of killing unwanted or deformed babies, personally rescuing one baby who has a birthmark. Jerusha goes through a difficult labor to give birth to her own healthy son, tended only by the inexperienced Abner (who excludes the native midwives) and afterwards Abner confesses to her his great love for her, a love he normally feels is sinful and tries to suppress. Abner baptizes his first convert, a young Hawaiian girl named Iliki who works as a servant for the Hales. However, he makes excuses to defer ordaining Keoki as a minister; in reality, he and his superiors have no intentions of ordaining any natives. Keoki eventually realizes that he will never be permitted to become a minister, despite having studied for years, including at Yale. He becomes disillusioned with Christianity as a result.
</p><p>Malama, who is a kind, loving and intelligent woman underneath her imperious facade, agrees to learn about Christianity, but will not take the final step to convert because she will have to send away Kelolo, her beloved husband of many years who is also her brother. At the Hales' urging, she enacts a curfew for sailors and forbids girls from swimming out to the ships. The sailors in port riot in protest, led by Captain Hoxworth, who has made a stop on his long whaling voyage. In the midst of the melee, Hoxworth discovers that the love of his life, Jerusha, is in Lahaina and is now the wife of Reverend Hale, whom he already despises for inspiring Malama to enact the restrictions. The sailors partially torch the church, but the Hawaiians help the Hales put out the fire and then chase the sailors back to their ships. To console himself over Jerusha, Hoxworth entices Iliki to sail away with him, and knocks Abner overboard when he comes after her. 
</p><p>Malama, on her deathbed, agrees to renounce Kelolo and is baptized a Christian right before she dies while saying a final goodbye to Kelolo. Upon the death of the Ali'i Nui, as predicted by the natives, a strong wind begins to blow, destroying the church building (which Abner refused to build in a way that the villagers suggested to let the wind pass through). Soon after her death, Abner hears drums and discovers Kelolo conducting a marriage ceremony for Keoki and Noelani, the new Ali'i Nui. Keoki, rejected as a minister, has turned back to the traditional gods. Keoki also reveals that while his mother Malama agreed to become a Christian in order to set an example for her people, whom she realized must become Christians for their own good as more and more white settlers arrive, she secretly asked that after she was buried in the Christian graveyard, her family move her bones to an undisclosed location where she can be with the old gods, and that Kelolo take her heart back to <a href="/wiki/Bora_Bora" title="Bora Bora">Bora Bora</a>, the land of their ancestors. Horrified and enraged, Abner curses the Kanakoa family and the other Hawaiians and tells them God will punish them for their sins. 
</p><p>Noelani, pregnant by Keoki, gives birth to a horribly deformed baby who cannot be accepted as Ali'i Nui. Jerusha begs Abner to intercede to save the baby, whom she fears will be killed, but he refuses, saying it is God's punishment for Keoki's and Noelani's sin. Keoki drowns the baby in the ocean, causing a rift between Abner and Jerusha. Shortly afterwards, a sailor carries measles into the port of Lahaina. While this is a relatively minor childhood illness to the missionaries and sailors, the native Hawaiians have no resistance, develop high fevers and die in droves. Keoki dies in Abner's arms in a feverish delirium, renouncing God. Abner returns home wracked by sadness and guilt, feeling that he failed in his mission to save Keoki and the other natives from hell. Jerusha, who is worn out from overwork in the hot climate, giving birth to three children, and nursing the sick Hawaiians, tells him that she does not believe God would send loving people like the Hawaiians to hell even if they weren't Christians, and furthermore tells Abner he can help the Hawaiians by giving them what he has always had difficulty giving her - his love. Jerusha soon dies, mourned by Abner, her children, and Captain Hoxworth, who never got over losing her to Abner. 
</p><p>After Jerusha's death, Abner becomes more loving towards the Hawaiians and works with them to try to prevent white settlers and plantation owners from taking their land. His position is at odds with the other ministers, who have recently voted that it is time for the churches to own land themselves and try to make money from it, something the ministers had avoided before. Abner is reassigned back to New England and his Lahaina church is given to another minister. But Abner refuses to leave Lahaina and says he will stay and continue to preach, in the street if necessary, and without any support from the church organization. He does agree to send the three Hale children back to New England to live with the Bromleys and receive a proper education. After bidding his children goodbye at the dock, Abner returns to his hut to find that a young Hawaiian man has arrived who wishes to be his assistant and help him, something the aging, frail Abner very much needs. He is overjoyed to see that the young man is the baby with the birthmark, now grown to an adult, whom Jerusha saved from being killed many years ago.
</p><p>The film centers on the volatile marriage of a middle-aged couple: George, an associate history professor at a small <a href="/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a> college, and Martha, the daughter of the university president. After they return home drunk from a party, Martha reveals she has invited a young married couple, whom she had met at the party, for a drink. The guests arrive – Nick, a biology professor (whom Martha mistakenly believes to be a math professor), and his wife, Honey – at 2:30 am. As the four drink, Martha and George engage in scathing verbal abuse in front of Nick and Honey. The younger couple is first embarrassed and later enmeshed.
</p><p>The wives briefly separate from the husbands, and upon their return, Honey reveals that Martha has told her about her and George's son, adding that she understands that the following day (Sunday) will mark his sixteenth birthday. George is visibly angry that Martha has divulged this information.
</p><p>Martha taunts George aggressively and he retaliates with his usual passive aggression. Martha tells an embarrassing story about how she humiliated him in front of her father. Martha's taunts continue, and George reacts violently by breaking a bottle. Nick and Honey become increasingly unsettled, and Honey, who has had too much brandy, and has just been whirled violently around the room by George while chanting "Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?" (to the tune of "<a href="/wiki/Here_We_Go_Round_the_Mulberry_Bush" title="Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush">Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush</a>"), runs to the bathroom to vomit.
</p><p>Martha goes to the kitchen to make coffee, and George and Nick go outside. The younger man confesses he was attracted to Honey more for her family's money than passion, and married her only because he mistakenly believed she was pregnant. George describes his own marriage as one of never-ending accommodation and adjustment, then admits he considers Nick a threat. George also tells a story about a boy he grew up with who had accidentally killed his mother and years later, his father, and ended up living out his days in a mental hospital. Nick admits he aims to charm and sleep his way to the top, and jokes that Martha would be a good place to start.
</p><p>When their guests propose leaving, George insists on driving them home, despite his inebriated state. They approach a <a href="/wiki/Roadhouse_(facility)" title="Roadhouse (facility)">roadhouse</a>, and Honey suggests they stop to dance. While Honey and George watch, Nick suggestively dances with Martha, who continues to mock and criticize George. George unplugs the jukebox and announces the game is over. In response, Martha alludes to the fact he may have murdered his parents like the protagonist in his unpublished, <a href="/wiki/Non-fiction_novel" title="Non-fiction novel">non-fiction novel</a>, prompting George to attack Martha until Nick pulls him away from her. George tells the group about a second novel he allegedly has written about a young couple from the Midwest, a good-looking teacher and his timid wife, who marry because of her <a href="/wiki/False_pregnancy" title="False pregnancy">hysterical pregnancy</a> and money, then settle in a small college town. An embarrassed Honey realizes Nick indiscreetly told George about their past and runs from the room. Nick promises revenge on George, and then runs after Honey.
</p><p>In the parking lot, George tells his wife he cannot stand the way she constantly humiliates him, and she tauntingly accuses him of having married her for just that reason. Their rage erupts into a declaration of "total war". Martha drives off, retrieving Nick and Honey, leaving George to make his way back home on foot. When he arrives home, he discovers the car crashed on the drive and Honey half conscious on the back seat and sees Martha and Nick together through the bedroom window. Through Honey's drunken babbling, George begins to suspect that her pregnancy was in fact real, and that she secretly had an <a href="/wiki/Abortion" title="Abortion">abortion</a>. He then devises a plan to get back at Martha.
</p><p>When Martha accuses Nick of being sexually inadequate, he blames his lack of performance on all the liquor he has consumed. George then appears holding snapdragons, which he throws at Martha and Nick in another game.  He mentions his and Martha's son, prompting her to reminisce about his birth and childhood and how he was nearly destroyed by his father. George accuses Martha of engaging in destructive and abusive behavior with the boy, who frequently ran away to escape her attention. George then announces he has received a telegram with bad news—their son has been killed in a car accident. 
</p><p>As Martha begs George not to "kill" their son, Nick suddenly realizes the truth: Martha and George had never been able to have children, and filled the void with an imaginary son. By declaring their son dead, accordingly, George has "killed" him. George explains that their one mutually-agreed-upon rule was to never mention the "existence" of their son to anyone else, and that he "killed" him because Martha broke that rule by mentioning him to Honey.
</p><p>The young couple departs quietly, and George and Martha are left alone as the day begins to break outside. George starts singing the song "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?", and Martha responds, "I am, George, I am."

Bagheera speaks to Baloo that night and convinces him that the jungle will never be safe for Mowgli so long as Shere Khan is there. In the morning, Baloo reluctantly explains to Mowgli that the Man-Village is best for the boy, but Mowgli accuses him of breaking his promise and runs away. As Baloo sets off in search of Mowgli, Bagheera rallies the help of Hathi and his patrol. However, Shere Khan himself, who was eavesdropping on Bagheera and Hathi's conversation, is now determined to hunt and kill Mowgli himself.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Mowgli has encountered Kaa once again, but thanks to the unwitting intervention of the suspicious Shere Khan, Mowgli escapes. As a storm gathers, a depressed Mowgli encounters a group of friendly <a href="/wiki/Slender-billed_vulture" title="Slender-billed vulture">vultures</a> who accept Mowgli as a fellow outcast. Shere Khan appears shortly after, scaring off the vultures and confronting Mowgli. Baloo rushes to the rescue and tries to keep Shere Khan away from Mowgli, but is injured.  When lightning strikes a nearby tree and sets it ablaze, the vultures swoop in to distract Shere Khan while Mowgli gathers flaming branches and ties them to Shere Khan's tail. <a href="/wiki/Pyrophobia" title="Pyrophobia">Terrified of fire</a>, the tiger panics and runs off.
</p><p>Bagheera and Baloo take Mowgli to the edge of the Man-Village, but Mowgli is still hesitant to go there. His mind soon changes when he is smitten by a beautiful young girl from the village who is coming down by the riverside to fetch water. After noticing Mowgli, she "accidentally" drops her water pot. Mowgli retrieves it for her and follows her into the Man-Village. After Mowgli chooses to stay in the Man-Village, Baloo and Bagheera decide to head home, content that Mowgli is safe and happy with his own kind.
</p><p>In 1967, Benjamin Braddock, aged 21, has earned his bachelor's degree from <a href="/wiki/Williams_College" title="Williams College">Williams College</a> and has returned home to a party celebrating his graduation at his parents' house in <a href="/wiki/Pasadena,_California" title="Pasadena, California">Pasadena</a>, <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>. Benjamin, visibly uncomfortable as his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans, evades those who try to congratulate him. Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's law partner, insists that he drive her home. Benjamin is coerced inside to have a drink and Mrs. Robinson attempts to seduce him. She invites him up to her daughter Elaine's room to see her portrait and then enters the room naked, making it clear that she is available to him. Benjamin initially rebuffs her but a few days later, he clumsily organizes a tryst at the Taft hotel.
</p><p>Benjamin spends the remainder of the summer drifting around in the pool by day, purposefully neglecting to select a graduate school, and seeing Mrs. Robinson at the hotel by night. He discovers that he and Mrs. Robinson have nothing to talk about. However, after Benjamin pesters her one evening, Mrs. Robinson reveals that she entered into a loveless marriage when she accidentally became pregnant with Elaine. Both Mr. Robinson and Benjamin's parents encourage him to call Elaine, but, in private, Mrs. Robinson forbids it.
</p><p>Benjamin takes Elaine on a date but tries to sabotage it by ignoring her, driving recklessly and taking her to a strip club. After Elaine runs out of the strip club in tears, Benjamin has a change of heart, realizes how rude he has been to her, and discovers that Elaine is someone with whom he is comfortable. In search of a late-night drink they visit the Taft hotel but when the staff greet Benjamin as "Mr. Gladstone" (the name he uses during his rendezvous with Mrs. Robinson) Elaine correctly guesses that he has been having an affair with a married woman and accepts his assurances that the affair is now over. To preempt a furious Mrs. Robinson, who threatens to tell Elaine her version of their affair, Benjamin tells Elaine that the married woman was her mother. Elaine is distraught and returns to <a href="/wiki/Berkeley,_California" title="Berkeley, California">Berkeley</a>. Benjamin pursues her there and tries to talk to her. She reveals that her mother's story is that he raped her while she was drunk, and refuses to believe that her mother actually seduced Benjamin. After pestering her to marry him for several days, Benjamin begins to make inroads with Elaine. However, Mr. Robinson arrives at Berkeley after learning about the affair, confronts Benjamin at his rooming house, and threatens to put him behind bars if Benjamin sees his daughter again. Mr. Robinson then forces Elaine to drop out of college and takes her away to marry Carl, a classmate with whom she had briefly been involved.
</p><p>Returning to Pasadena in search of Elaine, Benjamin breaks into the Robinson home but encounters Mrs. Robinson. She tells him he will not be able to stop the wedding and then calls the police claiming that her house is being burgled. Benjamin visits Carl's fraternity brothers who tell him that the wedding is in <a href="/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California" title="Santa Barbara, California">Santa Barbara, California</a> that very morning. He rushes to the church and arrives just as Elaine is married. He bangs on the glass at the back of the church and screams out "Elaine!" repeatedly. After a brief hesitation, Elaine screams out "Ben!" and starts to run toward him. A brawl ensues as guests try to stop Elaine and Benjamin from leaving together. Elaine manages to break free from her mother, who then slaps her. Benjamin manages to keep the guests at bay by jamming a large cross into the doors of the church. Both he and Elaine then run into the street to flag down a passing bus and take the back seat. Although initially elated at their victory, the pair become increasingly uncomfortable as they journey towards an uncertain future.
</p><p>In an African desert millions of years ago, a tribe of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hominid" title="Hominid">hominids</a> is driven away from its water hole by a rival tribe. They awaken to find a <a href="/wiki/Monolith_(Space_Odyssey)" title="Monolith (Space Odyssey)">featureless black monolith</a> has appeared before them. Seemingly influenced by the monolith, they discover how to use a bone as a weapon and drive their rivals away from the water hole.
</p><p>Millions of years later, a <a href="/wiki/Pan_American_World_Airways" title="Pan American World Airways">Pan Am</a> <a href="/wiki/List_of_spacecraft_from_the_Space_Odyssey_series#Orion_III_spaceplane" title="List of spacecraft from the Space Odyssey series">spaceplane</a> carries Dr. Heywood Floyd to the huge Space Station V orbiting Earth for a layover on his trip to <a href="/wiki/Clavius_Base" title="Clavius Base">Clavius Base</a>, a United States outpost on the Moon. After Floyd has a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Videophone" title="Videophone">videophone</a> call with his daughter, he deflects questions from his <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> scientist friend and her colleague about rumors of a mysterious epidemic at Clavius. Floyd speaks to a meeting of Clavius personnel, apologizing for the epidemic cover story but stressing secrecy. His mission is to investigate a recently found artifact buried four million years ago near the crater <a href="/wiki/Tycho_(lunar_crater)" title="Tycho (lunar crater)">Tycho</a>. Floyd and others ride in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Moonbus" title="Moonbus">Moonbus</a> to the artifact, a monolith identical to the one encountered by the ape-men. Sunlight strikes the monolith and a loud high-pitched radio signal is heard.
</p><p>Eighteen months later, the United States spacecraft <i><a href="/wiki/Discovery_One" title="Discovery One">Discovery One</a></i> is bound for <a href="/wiki/Jupiter" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. On board are mission pilots and scientists Dr. David Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole, along with three other scientists in <a href="/wiki/Suspended_animation" title="Suspended animation">suspended animation</a>. Most of <i>Discovery</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s operations are controlled by the ship's computer, a <a href="/wiki/HAL_9000" title="HAL 9000">HAL 9000</a> with a human personality that the crew calls "Hal". Hal says he is "foolproof and incapable of error". Hal raises concerns about the nature of the mission to Bowman, but their conversation is interrupted when Hal reports the imminent failure of an antenna control device. The astronauts retrieve it in an <a href="/wiki/Extravehicular_activity" title="Extravehicular activity">extravehicular activity</a> (EVA) pod but find nothing wrong. Hal suggests reinstalling the device and letting it fail so the problem can be found. Mission Control advises the astronauts that results from their twin HAL 9000 indicate that Hal is in error about the device's imminent failure. Hal says the discrepancy must be due to human error. Concerned about Hal's behavior, Bowman and Poole enter an EVA pod to talk without Hal overhearing, and agree to disconnect Hal if he is proven wrong. Hal secretly follows their conversation by <a href="/wiki/Lip_reading" title="Lip reading">lip reading</a>. While Poole is on a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Extra-vehicular_activity" title="Extra-vehicular activity">space walk</a> outside his EVA pod attempting to replace the unit, Hal takes control of the pod, severs his oxygen hose and sets him adrift. Bowman takes another pod to rescue Poole.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Hal turns off the life support functions of the crewmen in suspended animation. When Bowman returns to the ship with Poole's body, Hal refuses to let him in, stating that the astronauts' plan to deactivate him jeopardizes the mission. Bowman opens the ship's emergency airlock manually, enters the ship, and proceeds to Hal's processor core. Hal tries to reassure Bowman, then pleads with him to stop, and finally expresses fear. As Bowman gradually deactivates the circuits controlling Hal's higher intellectual functions, Hal regresses to his earliest programmed memory, the song "<a href="/wiki/Daisy_Bell" title="Daisy Bell">Daisy Bell</a>", which he sings for Bowman. When Bowman disconnects Hal, a prerecorded video message from Floyd plays, revealing that the mission's true objective is to investigate a radio signal, sent from a lunar artifact (the monolith) to Jupiter. Only Hal and the hibernating crew had been told this.
</p><p>At Jupiter, Bowman leaves <i>Discovery One</i> in an EVA pod to investigate another monolith orbiting the planet. The pod is pulled into a vortex of colored light, the Star Gate, and Bowman races across vast distances of space, viewing bizarre cosmological phenomena and strange landscapes of unusual colors.
</p><p>Bowman finds himself in a bedroom appointed in the <a href="/wiki/Neoclassicism" title="Neoclassicism">neoclassical</a> style. He sees, and then becomes, older versions of himself, first standing in the bedroom, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire and eating dinner, and finally as an old man lying in the bed. A monolith appears at the foot of the bed, and as Bowman reaches for it, he is transformed into a <a href="/wiki/Fetus" title="Fetus">fetus</a> enclosed in a transparent orb of light, the Star Child. The new being floats in space beside the Earth, gazing at it.

</p><p>Fanny is first seen as a stage-struck teenager who gets her first job in <a href="/wiki/Vaudeville" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</a> and meets the suave Arnstein following her debut performance. They continue to meet occasionally over the years, becoming more romantically involved as Fanny's career flourishes and she becomes a star. Arnstein eventually seduces Fanny, who decides to abandon the <i>Follies</i> to be with him.
</p><p>After winning a fortune playing poker while traveling aboard the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/RMS_Berengaria" title="RMS Berengaria">RMS <i>Berengaria</i></a>, Nicky agrees to marry Fanny. They move into an expensive house and have a daughter, and Fanny eventually returns to Ziegfeld and the <i>Follies</i>. Meanwhile, Nicky's various business ventures fail, forcing them to move into an apartment. Refusing financial support from his wife, he becomes involved in a bonds scam and is imprisoned for <a href="/wiki/Embezzlement" title="Embezzlement">embezzlement</a> for eighteen months.

</p><p>In late 1890s <a href="/wiki/Wyoming" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, <a href="/wiki/Butch_Cassidy" title="Butch Cassidy">Butch Cassidy</a> is the affable, clever, talkative leader of the outlaw <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hole_in_the_Wall_Gang" title="Hole in the Wall Gang">Hole in the Wall Gang</a>. His closest companion is the laconic <a href="/wiki/Sharpshooter" title="Sharpshooter">dead-shot</a> "<a href="/wiki/Sundance_Kid" title="Sundance Kid">Sundance Kid</a>". The two return to their hideout at <a href="/wiki/Hole-in-the-Wall" title="Hole-in-the-Wall">Hole-in-the-Wall</a> (Wyoming) to discover that the rest of the gang, irked at Butch's long absences, have selected <a href="/wiki/Harvey_Logan" title="Harvey Logan">Harvey Logan</a> as their new leader.
</p><p>Harvey challenges Butch to a <a href="/wiki/Knife_fight" title="Knife fight">knife fight</a> over the gang's leadership. Butch defeats him using trickery, but embraces Harvey's idea to rob the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Union_Pacific" title="Union Pacific">Union Pacific</a> <i>Overland Flyer</i> train on both its eastward and westward runs, agreeing that the second robbery would be unexpected and likely reap even more money than the first.
</p><p>The first robbery goes well. To celebrate, Butch and Sundance visit a favorite <a href="/wiki/Brothel" title="Brothel">brothel</a> in a nearby town and watch, amused, as the town sheriff unsuccessfully attempts to organize a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Posse_comitatus_(common_law)" title="Posse comitatus (common law)">posse</a> to track down the gang. They then visit Sundance's lover, schoolteacher <a href="/wiki/Etta_Place" title="Etta Place">Etta Place</a>.
</p><p>On the second train robbery, Butch uses too much <a href="/wiki/Dynamite" title="Dynamite">dynamite</a> to blow open the <a href="/wiki/Safe" title="Safe">safe</a>, blowing up the baggage car. As the gang scrambles to gather up the money, a second train arrives carrying a six-man team of lawmen pursuing Butch and Sundance, who unsuccessfully try to hide out in the brothel and to seek <a href="/wiki/Amnesty" title="Amnesty">amnesty</a> from the friendly Sheriff Bledsoe by enlisting in the army.
</p><p>As the posse remains in pursuit, despite all attempts to elude them, Butch and Sundance determine that the group includes renowned Indian <a href="/wiki/Tracking_(hunting)" title="Tracking (hunting)">tracker</a> "Lord Baltimore" and relentless lawman <a href="/wiki/Joe_Lefors" title="Joe Lefors">Joe Lefors</a>, recognizable by his white <a href="/wiki/Boater" title="Boater">skimmer</a>. Butch and Sundance finally elude their pursuers by jumping from a cliff into a river far below. They learn from Etta that the posse has been paid by Union Pacific head <a href="/wiki/E._H._Harriman" title="E. H. Harriman">E. H. Harriman</a> to remain on their trail until Butch and Sundance are both killed.
</p><p>Butch convinces Sundance and Etta that the three should escape to <a href="/wiki/Bolivia" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, which Butch envisions as a robber's paradise. On their arrival there, Sundance is dismayed by the living conditions and regards the country with contempt, but Butch remains optimistic. They discover that they know too little <a href="/wiki/Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> to pull off a bank robbery, so Etta attempts to teach them the language. With her as an accomplice, they become successful bank robbers known as <i>Los Bandidos Yanquis</i>. However, their confidence drops when they see a man wearing a white hat (the signature of determined lawman Lefors) and fear that Harriman's posse is still after them.
</p><p>Butch suggests "going straight", and he and Sundance land their first honest job as <a href="/wiki/Payroll" title="Payroll">payroll</a> guards for a mining company. However, they are ambushed by local bandits on their first run and their boss, Percy Garris, is killed. Butch and Sundance ambush and kill the bandits, the first time Butch has ever shot someone. Etta recommends farming or ranching as other lines of work, but they conclude the straight life isn't for them. Sensing they will be killed if they return to robbery, Etta decides to go back to the United States.
</p><p>Butch and Sundance steal a payroll and the mules carrying it, and arrive in a small town. A boy recognizes the mules' <a href="/wiki/Livestock_branding" title="Livestock branding">brand</a> and alerts the local police, leading to a gunfight with the outlaws. They take cover in a building but are both seriously wounded, after Butch makes a futile attempt to run to the mules in order to bring more ammunition, while Sundance provides cover fire. As dozens of Bolivian soldiers surround the area, Butch suggests the duo's next destination should be Australia. They charge out of the building guns blazing.
</p><p>Oliver Barrett IV, the heir of an American upper-class <a href="/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="East Coast of the United States">East Coast</a> family, is attending <a href="/wiki/Harvard_College" title="Harvard College">Harvard College</a> where he plays <a href="/wiki/Ice_hockey" title="Ice hockey">ice hockey</a>. He meets Jennifer "Jenny" Cavilleri, a quick-witted, working-class <a href="/wiki/Radcliffe_College" title="Radcliffe College">Radcliffe College</a> student of classical music; they quickly fall in love despite their differences.  
</p><p>When Jenny reveals her plans to study in Paris, Oliver is upset that he does not figure in those plans. He proposes, she accepts, and they travel to the Barrett mansion so that she can meet Oliver's parents, who are judgmental and unimpressed with her. Later Oliver's father tells him that he will cut him off financially if he marries Jenny. After graduation Oliver and Jenny marry nonetheless.
</p><p>Without his father's financial support, the couple struggle to pay Oliver's way through <a href="/wiki/Harvard_Law_School" title="Harvard Law School">Harvard Law School</a>; Jenny works as a teacher. Oliver graduates third in his class and takes a position at a respectable New York City <a href="/wiki/Law_firm" title="Law firm">law firm</a>. They are ready to start a family, but fail to conceive. After many tests Oliver is told that Jenny is terminally ill.
</p><p>Oliver attempts to live a "normal life" without telling Jenny of her condition, but she finds out after confronting her doctor. Oliver buys tickets to Paris, but she declines to go, wanting only to spend time with him. To pay for Jenny's cancer therapy, Oliver seeks money from his estranged father, who asks him if he has "gotten a girl in trouble."  Oliver simply says yes, and his father writes a cheque.
</p><p>From her hospital bed, Jenny makes funeral arrangements with her father, then asks for Oliver. She tells him to not blame himself, insisting that he never held her back from music and it was worth it for the love they shared. Jenny's last wish is made when she asks him to embrace her tightly before she dies. As grief-stricken Oliver leaves the hospital, he sees his father outside, having rushed to New York City from Massachusetts as soon as he heard the news about Jenny and wanting to offer his help. Oliver tells him, "Jenny's dead," and his father says "I'm sorry," to which Oliver responds, "Love– <a href="/wiki/Love_means_never_having_to_say_you%27re_sorry" title="Love means never having to say you're sorry">Love means never having to say you're sorry</a>."

</p><p>Chicago is paralyzed by a snowstorm affecting <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lincoln_International_Airport" title="Lincoln International Airport">Lincoln International Airport</a>. A Trans Global Airlines (TGA) <a href="/wiki/Boeing_707" title="Boeing 707">Boeing 707</a> flight crew misjudge their turn from Runway 29 onto the taxiway, becoming stuck in the snow and closing that runway. Airport manager Mel Bakersfeld (Burt Lancaster) is forced to work overtime, causing tension with his wife, Cindy. A divorce seems imminent as he nurtures a closer relationship with a co-worker, TGA customer relations agent Tanya Livingston (Jean Seberg).
</p><p>Vernon Demerest (Dean Martin) is a TGA <a href="/wiki/Pilot_licensing_and_certification#Airline_Transport_Pilot" title="Pilot licensing and certification">captain</a> scheduled to be the checkride captain for the airline to evaluate Captain Anson Harris during its Flight 2 to Rome. TGA's flagship international service, named <i>The Golden Argosy</i>, is being operated with a <a href="/wiki/Boeing_707" title="Boeing 707">Boeing 707</a>. Although Demerest is married to Bakersfeld's sister, Sarah, he is secretly having an affair with Gwen Meighen (Jacqueline Bisset), chief stewardess on the flight, who informs him before takeoff that she is pregnant with his child.
</p><p>Bakersfeld borrows <a href="/wiki/Trans_World_Airlines" title="Trans World Airlines">TWA</a> mechanic Joe Patroni (George Kennedy) to assist with moving TGA's disabled plane blocking Runway 29. Mel and Tanya also deal with Mrs. Ada Quonsett (Helen Hayes), an elderly lady from San Diego who is a habitual <a href="/wiki/Stowaway" title="Stowaway">stowaway</a> on various airlines.
</p><p>Demolition expert D.O. Guerrero (Van Heflin), down on his luck and with a history of mental illness, buys both a one-way TGA ticket aboard <i>The Golden Argosy</i> and a large life insurance policy with the intent of committing suicide by blowing up the plane. He plans to set off a bomb in an attaché case while over the Atlantic Ocean so that his wife, Inez, will collect the insurance money of $225,000. His erratic behavior at the airport, including using his last cash to buy the insurance policy and mistaking a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Customs" title="U.S. Customs">U.S. Customs</a> officer for an airline gate agent, attracts airport officials' attention. Inez finds a Special Delivery envelope from a travel agency and, realizing D.O. might be doing something desperate, goes to the airport to try to dissuade him. She informs airport officials that he had been fired from a construction job for "misplacing" explosives and that the family's financial situation was desperate.
</p><p>Ada manages to evade the TGA employee assigned the task of putting her on a flight back to Los Angeles, talks her way past the gate agent, boards Flight 2, and happens to sit next to D.O. When the <i>Golden Argosy</i> crew is made aware of D.O.'s presence and possible intentions, they turn the plane back toward Chicago without informing the passengers. Once Ada is discovered, her help is enlisted by the crew to get to D.O.'s briefcase, but the ploy fails when a would-be helpful male passenger unwittingly returns the case to D.O.
</p><p>Captain Demerest goes back into the passenger cabin and tries to persuade D.O. not to trigger the bomb, informing him that his insurance policy will be useless. D.O. briefly considers giving Vernon the bomb, but just then another passenger exits the lavatory at the rear of the aircraft, and the same would-be helpful passenger yells out that D.O. has a bomb. D.O. runs into the lavatory, locks it, and sets off the device. D.O. dies instantly and is blown out of the aircraft through the hole in the fuselage caused by the explosion. Gwen, just outside the door, is injured in the explosion and subsequent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Explosive_decompression" title="Explosive decompression">explosive decompression</a>, but the pilots retain control of the airplane.
</p><p>With all airports east of Chicago unusable due to bad weather, they return to Lincoln International for an emergency landing. Due to the bomb damage, Captain Demerest demands the airport's longest runway—Runway 29, which is still closed due to the stuck airliner. Eventually Mel orders the plane to be pushed off the runway by snowplows, despite the costly damage they would do to it. Patroni, who is "taxi-qualified" on Boeing 707s, has been trying to move the stuck aircraft in time for Vernon's damaged aircraft to land.  By exceeding the Boeing 707's engine operating parameters, Patroni frees the stuck jet without damage, allowing Runway 29 to be reopened just in time for the crippled <i>Golden Argosy</i> to land.
</p><p>In a brief epilogue, Ada is enjoying her reward of free first-class travel on TGA. But as she arrives at the gate, she laments that it was "much more fun the other way."
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Marseille" title="Marseille">Marseille</a>, an undercover police detective is following Alain Charnier, a wealthy French criminal who runs the largest heroin-smuggling syndicate in the world. The policeman is assassinated by Charnier's hitman, Pierre Nicoli. Charnier plans to smuggle $32 million worth of heroin into the United States by hiding it in the car of his unsuspecting friend, French television personality Henri Devereaux, who is traveling to New York by ship.
</p><p>In New York City, detectives <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_%22Popeye%22_Doyle" title='Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle'>Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle</a> and Buddy "Cloudy" Russo are conducting an undercover stakeout in Brooklyn. After seeing a drug transaction take place in a bar, Cloudy goes in to make an arrest. After a short pursuit, the detectives interrogate the man, who reveals his drug connection.
</p><p>Later, Popeye and Cloudy go out for drinks at the <a href="/wiki/Copacabana_(nightclub)" title="Copacabana (nightclub)">Copacabana</a>, where <a href="/wiki/The_Three_Degrees" title="The Three Degrees">The Three Degrees</a> give a high energy performance of the <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Webb" title="Jimmy Webb">Jimmy Webb</a> track "Everybody Gets to Go to the Moon"<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[6]</a></sup>. Popeye notices Salvatore "Sal" Boca and his young wife, Angie, entertaining mobsters involved in narcotics. They decide to tail the couple, and soon learn that the Bocas, who run a modest newsstand luncheonette, have criminal records. The detectives suspect that the Bocas are involved in some kind of criminal operation. They soon establish a link between the Bocas and lawyer Joel Weinstock, who is part of the narcotics underworld.
</p><p>Soon after, Popeye learns from an informant that a massive shipment of heroin will arrive in the New York area in the next two weeks. The detectives convince their supervisor, Walt Simonson, to wiretap the Bocas' phones. They use several ruses to obtain additional information. Popeye and Cloudy are joined in the investigation by a federal agents Mulderig and Klein.
</p><p>After Devereaux's vehicle arrives in New York City, Weinstock's chemist tests a sample of the heroin and declares it the purest he has ever seen, establishing that the shipment could make as much as $32 million on a half-million dollar investment. Boca is impatient to make the purchase—reflecting Charnier's desire to return to France as soon as possible—while Weinstock, with more experience in smuggling, urges patience, knowing Boca's phone is tapped and that they are being investigated.
</p><p>Charnier soon realizes he has been observed since his arrival in New York. He "makes" Popeye and escapes, waving tauntingly on the departing subway shuttle. To avoid being tailed, he has Sal Boca instead meet him in Washington D.C., where Boca asks for a delay to avoid the police. Charnier, however, wants to conclude the deal quickly so he can return to France. On the flight back to New York, Nicoli offers to kill Popeye, but Charnier objects, knowing that Popeye would be replaced by another policeman. Nicoli insists, however, saying they will be back in France before a replacement is assigned.
</p><p>Soon after, Nicoli attempts to shoot Popeye from the roof of Doyle's apartment complex but misses. Popeye chases Nicoli, who boards an elevated train at the <a href="/wiki/Bay_50th_Street_(BMT_West_End_Line)" title="Bay 50th Street (BMT West End Line)">Bay 50th Street Station</a> in Gravesend. Doyle commandeers a car and gives chase along Stillwell Avenue. Realizing he is being pursued, Nicoli works his way forward through the carriages, shoots a policeman who tries to intervene and then hijacks the motorman at gunpoint forcing him to drive straight through the next station, also shooting the train conductor who gets too close. The motorman passes out and they are just about to slam into another, stationary, train, when an emergency trackside brake engages violently hurling the assassin against a glass window. Popeye arrives limping, having wrecked the commandeered car, and sees the killer descending from the platform. When the killer sees Popeye, he turns to run but is shot dead by Popeye with a single shot.
</p><p>After a lengthy stakeout, Popeye impounds Devereaux's Lincoln. In a police garage, he and his team take it apart piece by piece, searching for the drugs, but seemingly come up empty-handed. Then Cloudy notes that the vehicle's shipping weight is 120 pounds over its listed manufacturer's weight; they realize the contraband must still be in the car. This time they remove the rocker panels and discover the obloid packages of heroin concealed therein. The police then restore the car to its original condition and return it to Devereaux, who delivers the Lincoln to Charnier.
</p><p>Charnier drives to an old factory on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wards_Island" title="Wards Island">Wards Island</a> to meet Weinstock and about a dozen others, and deliver the drugs. After Charnier has the rocker panels removed, Weinstock's chemist tests one of the bags and confirms its quality. Charnier removes the bags of drugs and hides the money, concealing it beneath the rocker panels of another car that was purchased at an auction of junk cars, which he will then take back to France. With their transaction complete, Charnier and Sal drive off in the Lincoln, but almost immediately hit a roadblock with a large contingent of police led by Popeye Doyle, who playfully waves to Charnier. The police chase the Lincoln back to the factory, where Sal is killed with two shotgun blasts during a shootout with the police and most of the other criminals surrender.
</p><p>Charnier, however, escapes into the old warehouse and Popeye follows after him, with Cloudy joining in the hunt. When Popeye sees a shadowy figure in the distance, he empties his revolver a split-second after shouting a warning. The man whom Popeye kills, however, is not Charnier but Mulderig. Undaunted, Popeye tells Cloudy that he will get Charnier. After reloading his gun, Popeye runs into another room, and a few seconds later, a single gunshot is heard.
</p><p>Title cards before the closing credits note that Joel Weinstock was indicted but had his case dismissed for "lack of proper evidence"; Angie Boca received a suspended sentence for an unspecified misdemeanor; Lou Boca received a reduced sentence; Devereaux served four years in a federal penitentiary for conspiracy; and Charnier was never caught. Popeye and Cloudy were transferred out of the narcotics division and reassigned.
</p><p>The film's plot largely follows that of <a href="/wiki/Fiddler_on_the_Roof" title="Fiddler on the Roof">the musical</a> from which it is adapted.
</p><p>In 1905, Tevye, a poor Jewish <a href="/wiki/Milkman" title="Milkman">milkman</a> living in the Ukrainian village of Anatevka, a typical <a href="/wiki/Shtetl" title="Shtetl">shtetl</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Pale_of_Settlement" title="Pale of Settlement">Pale of Settlement</a> of <a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" title="Russian Empire">Imperial Russia</a>, compares the lives of the Jews of Anatevka to a fiddler on the roof (who appears throughout the film in this metaphorical role), using tradition to "scratch out a pleasant, simple tune" without breaking their necks.
</p><p>In town, Tevye meets Perchik, a radical <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> from <a href="/wiki/Kiev" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>, who admonishes them for talking but doing nothing about news of Jews being banished from their villages by the tsar. Tevye invites Perchik to stay with his family, offering him room and board in exchange for Perchik tutoring his daughters.
</p><p>Tevye arranges for his oldest daughter, Tzeitel, to marry Lazar Wolf, an older, and widowed, wealthy butcher. Tzeitel is in love with her childhood sweetheart, Motel Kamzoil, and begs her father not to make her marry Lazar Wolf. Although he is initially angry, Tevye realizes that Tzeitel loves Motel and yields to his daughter's demands.
</p><p>In order to convince his wife Golde that Tzeitel should not be married to Lazar Wolf, Tevye claims to have had a nightmare. He says that Golde's deceased grandmother told him Tzeitel is supposed to marry Motel, and that Lazar Wolf's late wife, Fruma-Sarah, threatened to kill Tzeitel if the two are married. Golde concludes that the dream was a message from their ancestors, and Tzeitel and Motel arrange to be married.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Tevye's second daughter, Hodel, and Perchik begin to fall in love. They argue over the story of <a href="/wiki/Leah" title="Leah">Leah</a> and the place of old religious traditions in a changing world. The two dance together, which is considered forbidden by Orthodox Jewish tradition. Perchik tells Hodel that they just changed an old tradition.
</p><p>At Tzeitel and Motel's wedding, an argument breaks out after Lazar Wolf presents the newlyweds with gifts. When Tevye tries to speak to Lazar about the Torah, Lazar refuses to listen, arguing that the wedding should have been his all along. Minutes later, another argument breaks out over whether a girl should be able to choose her own husband. Perchik addresses the crowd and says that, since they love each other, it should be left for the couple to decide. He creates further controversy by asking Hodel to dance with him.
</p><p>The crowd gradually warms to the idea and Tevye and Golde, then Motel and Tzeitel, join in dancing. The wedding proceeds with great joy. Suddenly, the military presence in the town and the constable arrive and begin a <a href="/wiki/Anti-Jewish_pogroms_in_the_Russian_Empire" title="Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire">pogrom</a>, the "demonstration" which he had earlier warned Tevye was coming. The constable stops the attack on the wedding celebration after Perchik is wounded in the scuffle with the tsar's men; however, he allows the men to continue destroying property in the village. Tevye and the immediate family stand still, until Tevye angrily orders them to clean up instead of standing around. Tevye silently asks why God allowed this to happen to them.
</p><p>In its original <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Theatrical_release" title="Theatrical release">theatrical release</a>, the film was shown with an intermission and <a href="/wiki/Entr%27acte" title="Entr'acte">entr'acte music</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-afi_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-afi-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>Months later, Perchik prepares to leave Anatevka for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1905" title="Russian Revolution of 1905">revolution</a>. He proposes to Hodel, and she accepts. When they tell Tevye, he is furious that they have decided to marry without his permission, but he again relents because they love each other. Tevye tells Golde his reasons for consenting to their daughter's marriage, which leads them to re-evaluate their own arranged marriage. Tevye and Golde ultimately realize that, despite having been paired by a matchmaker, they do love each other.
</p><p>Weeks later, Perchik is arrested in <a href="/wiki/Kiev" title="Kiev">Kiev</a> and is <a href="/wiki/Exile" title="Exile">exiled</a> to <a href="/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a>. Hodel decides to join him there. She promises Tevye that she and Perchik will be married under a <a href="/wiki/Chuppah" title="Chuppah">canopy</a>. Meanwhile, Tzeitel and Motel become parents, and Motel finally buys the sewing machine for which he has long scrimped and saved.
</p><p>Tevye's third daughter Chava falls in love with a Russian Orthodox Christian named Fyedka. Tevye tells Chava to be distant friends with Fyedka, because of the difference in their religions. When Chava eventually works up the courage to ask Tevye's permission to marry Fyedka, Tevye tells her that marrying outside the family's faith is against tradition. He forbids her from having any contact with Fyedka or from even mentioning his name. The next morning, Fyedka and Chava elope and are married in a Russian Orthodox church.
</p><p>Golde learns of the marriage when she meets up with the priest. When a grief-stricken Golde tells Tevye about the marriage, he tells her that Chava is dead to the family and that they shall forget her altogether. Chava asks Tevye to accept her marriage. In a <a href="/wiki/Soliloquy" title="Soliloquy">soliloquy</a>, Tevye concludes that he cannot accept Chava <a href="/wiki/Interfaith_marriage_in_Judaism" title="Interfaith marriage in Judaism">marrying a non-Jew</a>. He accuses her of abandoning the Jewish faith and <a href="/wiki/Disownment" title="Disownment">disowns</a> her.
</p><p>One winter day, the Jews of Anatevka are notified that they have three days to leave the village or be forced out by the government. Tevye, his family and friends begin packing up to leave, heading for various parts of <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, Palestine, and the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>.
</p><p>Yente, the Matchmaker, plans to emigrate to <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, and says goodbye to Golde with an embrace before departing. Lazar Wolf plans to emigrate to Chicago, to live with his former brother in law, whom he detests, but "a relative is a relative". Lazar and Tevye share one last embrace before departing.
</p><p>Tevye receives letters from Hodel mentioning that she is working hard while Perchik stays in the Siberian prison. It is hoped that when Perchik is released, they will join the others in the United States. Chava and her husband Fyedka come to Tevye's house and tell the family that they are leaving for <a href="/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w" title="Kraków">Kraków</a>, <a href="/wiki/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a>, being unable to stay in a place that would force innocent people out. Tevye shows signs of forgiving Chava by murmuring under his breath "And God be with you," silently urging Tzeitel to repeat his words to Chava. Golde calls out to Chava and Fyedka, telling them where they will be living in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York</a> with a relative.
</p><p>The Constable silently watches as the mass evacuation of Anatevka takes place. The community forms their circle at a crossroad one last time before scattering in different directions. Tevye spots the fiddler and motions to him to come along, symbolizing that even though he must leave his town, his traditions will always be with him.

Bond kills a test subject, and later the "real" Blofeld, by drowning him in a pool of superheated mud.
</p><p>While assassins <a href="/wiki/Mr._Wint_and_Mr._Kidd" title="Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd">Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd</a> systematically kill several diamond smugglers, <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" title="M (James Bond)">M</a> suspects that <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South African</a> diamonds are being stockpiled to depress prices by <a href="/wiki/Dumping_(pricing_policy)" title="Dumping (pricing policy)">dumping</a>, and orders Bond to uncover the smuggling ring. Disguised as professional smuggler and assassin Peter Franks, Bond travels to <a href="/wiki/Amsterdam" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> to meet contact <a href="/wiki/Tiffany_Case" title="Tiffany Case">Tiffany Case</a>. The real Franks shows up on the way, but Bond intercepts and kills him, then switches IDs to make it seem as though Franks is Bond. Case and Bond then go to <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, smuggling the diamonds inside Franks' corpse.
</p><p>At the airport Bond meets his CIA ally <a href="/wiki/Felix_Leiter" title="Felix Leiter">Felix Leiter</a>, then travels to <a href="/wiki/Las_Vegas" title="Las Vegas">Las Vegas</a>. At a funeral home, Franks' body is cremated and the diamonds are passed on to another smuggler, Shady Tree. Bond is nearly killed by Wint and Kidd when they put him into a coffin and send it to a <a href="/wiki/Cremation" title="Cremation">cremation</a> oven, but Tree stops the process when he discovers that the diamonds in Franks' body were fakes planted by Bond and the CIA.
</p><p>Bond tells Leiter to ship him the real diamonds. Bond then goes to the Whyte House, a casino-hotel owned by the reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte, where Tree works as a stand-up comedian. Bond watches Tree's act and afterwards goes to his dressing room, where he discovers that Tree has been killed by Wint and Kidd, who did not know that the diamonds were fake.
</p><p>At the <a href="/wiki/Craps" title="Craps">craps</a> table Bond meets the opportunistic <a href="/wiki/Bond_girl" title="Bond girl">Plenty O'Toole</a>; after gambling, he brings her to his room. Gang members ambush them, throwing O'Toole out of a window and into a pool. Bond spends the rest of the night with Tiffany Case, instructing her to retrieve the real diamonds at the <a href="/wiki/Circus_Circus_Las_Vegas" title="Circus Circus Las Vegas">Circus Circus</a> casino.
</p><p>Tiffany reneges on her deal to meet back with Bond and instead flees, passing off the diamonds to the next smuggler. However, seeing that O'Toole was killed (after being mistaken for her), Tiffany changes her mind. She drives Bond to the airport, where the diamonds are given to Whyte's casino manager, Bert Saxby, who is followed to a remote facility. Bond enters the apparent destination of the diamonds: a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where a satellite is being built by Professor Metz, a laser refraction specialist. Bond fakes Metz by telling him he is Klaus Hergersheimer, a technician he met in the facility. His cover is blown when the real Hergersheimer shows up. Bond attempts to remain hidden, but is seen by security. He manages to evade the guards by stealing a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Moon_buggy" title="Moon buggy">moon buggy</a> and reunites with Tiffany. The laboratory report Bond's activity to the sheriff's office. Bond and Tiffany make their way back to Las Vegas; they are seen there by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Las_Vegas_Police_Department" title="Las Vegas Police Department">Las Vegas police</a>, who engage in a car chase, but Bond manages to evade all the cars.
</p><p>Bond later scales the walls to the Whyte House's top floor to confront Whyte. He is instead met by two identical Blofelds, who use an electronic device to sound like Whyte. Bond kills one of the Blofelds, which turns out to be a look-alike. The real Blofeld pulls a gun on Bond, and instructs him into a elevator, where he is knocked out by gas. He is picked up by Wint and Kidd, and taken out to <a href="/wiki/Las_Vegas_Valley" title="Las Vegas Valley">Las Vegas Valley</a>, where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die. The pipeline is buried the next morning.
</p><p>Bond escapes and calls Blofeld, using a similar electronic device made by Q to pose as Saxby. He finds out Whyte is kept at his summer house outside the city and goes there with Felix and the CIA. After a brief battle with Whyte's female bodyguards Bambi and Thumper, they rescue Whyte. Saxby attempts to kill Bond outside the summer house, but is fatally shot during the ensuing gunfight. In the meantime, Blofeld abducts Case. With the help of Whyte, Bond raids the lab and uncovers Blofeld's plot to create a <a href="/wiki/Sun_gun" title="Sun gun">laser satellite</a> using the diamonds, which by now has already been sent into orbit. With the satellite, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and the United States, then proposes an international auction for global nuclear supremacy.
</p><p>Whyte identifies an <a href="/wiki/Oil_platform" title="Oil platform">oil platform</a> off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Baja_California" title="Baja California">Baja California</a> as Blofeld's likely base of operations. After Bond's attempt to change the cassette containing the satellite control codes fails due to a mistake by Tiffany, a helicopter attack on the oil rig is launched by Leiter and the CIA.
</p><p>Blofeld tries to escape in a <a href="/wiki/Midget_submarine" title="Midget submarine">midget submarine</a>, but Bond gains control of the submarine's launch crane and crashes the sub into the control room, causing both the satellite control and the base to be destroyed. Bond and Tiffany then head for Britain on a <a href="/wiki/SS_Canberra" title="SS Canberra">cruise ship</a>, where Wint and Kidd pose as room-service stewards and attempt to kill them with a hidden bomb. Bond turns the tables on them, causing Kidd to hurl himself overboard after being set aflame and Wint to detonate with the bomb after being thrown overboard. Tiffany then asks James Bond a sensitive question: "How the hell do we get those diamonds down again?"
</p><p>The obvious cause of the question is the diamonds in the satellite, which can be seen by Bond and Tiffany as a speck in the night sky.
</p><p>In 1945, at his daughter Connie's wedding, <a href="/wiki/Don_(honorific)" title="Don (honorific)">Don</a> Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as head of a New York crime family.

Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized <a href="/wiki/Stud_(animal)" title="Stud (animal)">stallion</a>.
</p><p>Shortly before Christmas, drug baron Virgil "The Turk" Sollozzo, backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, <a href="/wiki/Luca_Brasi" title="Luca Brasi">Luca Brasi</a>, to spy on them. Brasi is <a href="/wiki/Garrote" title="Garrote">garroted</a> during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later Sollozzo has Vito gunned down in the street, then kidnaps Hagen. With Corleone first-born <a href="/wiki/Sonny_Corleone" title="Sonny Corleone">Sonny</a> in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca "sleeps with the fishes." Vito survives, and at the hospital Michael thwarts another attempt on his father; Michael's jaw is broken by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NYPD" title="NYPD">NYPD</a> Captain Marc McCluskey, Sollozzo's unauthorized bodyguard. Sonny retaliates with a <a href="/wiki/Contract_killing" title="Contract killing">hit</a> on Bruno Tattaglia. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey: on the deception of settling the dispute, Michael arranges to meet them in a <a href="/wiki/The_Bronx" title="The Bronx">Bronx</a> restaurant. There, retrieving a planted handgun, he kills both men.
</p><p>Despite a clampdown by the authorities, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Five_Families_(The_Godfather)" title="Five Families (The Godfather)">Five Families</a> erupt in open warfare and Vito fears for his sons' safety.

When it does, Sonny speeds to their home, but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and riddled with submachine gun fire. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries Apollonia Vitelli, but a car bomb intended for him takes her life.
</p><p>Devastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant Don <a href="/wiki/Emilio_Barzini" title="Emilio Barzini">Emilio Barzini</a>, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s, and with his father at the end of his career and his brother too weak, Michael takes the family reins.  He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Tom is not a "wartime consigliere"; Vito agrees Tom should "have no part in what will happen" in the coming battles with rival families. Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos. Michael is dismayed to see that Fredo has fallen under Greene's sway.
</p><p>In 1955, Vito suffers a fatal <a href="/wiki/Myocardial_infarction" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a>. At the funeral, <a href="/wiki/Salvatore_Tessio" title="Salvatore Tessio">Tessio</a>, a Corleone <a href="/wiki/Caporegime" title="Caporegime">capo</a>, asks Michael to meet with Don Barzini, signalling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the christening of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone assassins murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is executed for his treachery and Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini. A Corleone capo, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Clemenza" title="Peter Clemenza">Clemenza</a>, garrotes Carlo with a wire.

</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Georgetown_(Washington,_D.C.)" title="Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)">Georgetown</a>, actress Chris MacNeil is living on location with her 12-year-old daughter <a href="/wiki/Regan_MacNeil" title="Regan MacNeil">Regan</a>; she is starring in a film about student activism directed by her friend and associate Burke Dennings. After playing with a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ouija_board" title="Ouija board">Ouija board</a> and contacting a supposedly imaginary friend whom she calls Captain Howdy, Regan begins acting strangely, including making mysterious noises, stealing, constantly using obscene language and exhibiting abnormal strength. Chris hosts a party, during which Regan comes downstairs unannounced, tells one of the guests—an astronaut—that he will die in space and then urinates on the floor. Later, Regan's bed begins to shake violently, adding further to her mother's horror. Chris consults a number of physicians, but Dr. Klein and his associates find nothing physiologically wrong with her daughter, despite Regan undergoing a battery of diagnostic tests. 
</p><p>One night when Chris is out, Burke Dennings is babysitting a heavily sedated Regan. Chris returns to hear he has died falling out the window. Although this is assumed to have been an accident given Burke's history of heavy drinking, his death is investigated by Lieutenant William Kinderman. Kinderman interviews Chris. He also consults psychiatrist Father Damien Karras, recently shaken after the death of his frail mother.
</p><p>The doctors, thinking that Regan's aberrations are mostly psychiatric in origin, recommend an exorcism be performed. Chris arranges a meeting with Karras. After Regan speaks backwards in different voices and exhibits scars in the form of the words "Help Me" on her stomach, Karras is convinced that Regan is possessed. Believing her soul is in danger, he decides to perform an exorcism. The experienced Merrin is selected for performing the actual exorcism with Karras assisting.
</p><p>Both priests witness Regan perform a series of bizarre, vulgar acts. They attempt to exorcise the demon, but the stubborn entity toys with them, especially Karras. Karras shows weakness and is dismissed by Merrin, who attempts the exorcism alone. Karras enters the room later and discovers Merrin has died of a heart attack. After failing to revive Merrin, the enraged Karras confronts the mocking, laughing spirit, and wrestles Regan's body to the ground. At Karras's invitation, it leaves Regan's body and possesses Karras. In a moment of self-sacrifice, the priest throws himself out of the window before being compelled to harm Regan. He is mortally injured. Father Dyer, an old friend of Karras, happens upon the scene and administers the last rites to his friend.
</p><p>A few days later, Regan, now back to her normal self, prepares to leave for Los Angeles with her mother. Although Regan has no apparent recollection of her possession, she is moved by the sight of Dyer's clerical collar to kiss him on the cheek. Kinderman, who narrowly misses their departure, befriends Father Dyer as he investigates Karras' death.
</p><p>The film takes place in 1936, at the height of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression_in_the_United_States" title="Great Depression in the United States">Great Depression</a>. Johnny Hooker, a <a href="/wiki/Confidence_trick" title="Confidence trick">grifter</a> in <a href="/wiki/Joliet,_Illinois" title="Joliet, Illinois">Joliet, Illinois</a>, cons $11,000 in cash in a <a href="/wiki/Pigeon_drop" title="Pigeon drop">pigeon drop</a> from an unsuspecting victim with the aid of his partners Luther Coleman and Joe Erie. Buoyed by the windfall, Luther announces his retirement and advises Hooker to seek out an old friend, Henry Gondorff, in <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> to teach him "the big con". Unfortunately, their victim was a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Numbers_racket" title="Numbers racket">numbers racket</a> courier for vicious crime boss Doyle Lonnegan. Corrupt Joliet police Lieutenant William Snyder confronts Hooker, revealing Lonnegan's involvement and demanding part of Hooker's cut. Having already spent his share, Hooker pays Snyder in counterfeit bills. Lonnegan's men murder both the courier and Luther, and Hooker flees for his life to Chicago.
</p><p>Hooker finds Henry Gondorff, a once-great con-man now hiding from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/FBI" title="FBI">FBI</a>, and asks for his help in taking on the dangerous Lonnegan. Gondorff is initially reluctant, but he relents and recruits a core team of experienced con men to dupe Lonnegan. They decide to resurrect an elaborate obsolete scam known as "the wire", using a larger crew of con artists to create a phony <a href="/wiki/Off-track_betting" title="Off-track betting">off-track betting</a> parlor. Aboard the opulent <i><a href="/wiki/20th_Century_Limited" title="20th Century Limited">20th Century Limited</a></i>, Gondorff, posing as boorish Chicago bookie Shaw, buys into Lonnegan's private, high-stakes <a href="/wiki/Poker" title="Poker">poker</a> game. Shaw infuriates Lonnegan with his obnoxious behavior, then outcheats him to win $15,000. Hooker, posing as Shaw's disgruntled employee, Kelly, is sent to collect the winnings and instead convinces Lonnegan that he wants to take over Shaw's operation. Kelly reveals that he has a partner named Les Harmon (actually con man Kid Twist) in the Chicago <a href="/wiki/Western_Union" title="Western Union">Western Union</a> office, who will allow them to win bets on horse races by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Past-posting" title="Past-posting">past-posting</a>.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Snyder has tracked Hooker to Chicago, but his pursuit is thwarted when he is summoned by undercover FBI agents led by Agent Polk, who orders him to assist in their plan to arrest Gondorff using Hooker. At the same time, Lonnegan has grown frustrated with the inability of his men to find and kill Hooker for the Joliet con. Unaware that Kelly is Hooker, he demands that Salino, his best assassin, be given the job. A mysterious figure with black leather gloves is then seen following and observing Hooker.
</p><p>Kelly's connection appears effective, as Harmon provides Lonnegan with the winner of one horse race and the <a href="/wiki/Trifecta" title="Trifecta">trifecta</a> of another. Lonnegan agrees to finance a $500,000 bet at Shaw's parlor to break Shaw and gain revenge. Shortly thereafter, Snyder captures Hooker and brings him before FBI Agent Polk. Polk forces Hooker to betray Gondorff by threatening to incarcerate Luther Coleman's widow.
</p><p>The night before the sting, Hooker sleeps with Loretta, a waitress from a local restaurant. As Hooker leaves the building the next morning, he sees Loretta walking toward him. The black-gloved man appears behind Hooker and shoots her dead – she was Lonnegan's hired killer, Loretta Salino, and the gunman was hired by Gondorff to protect Hooker.
</p><p>Armed with Harmon's tip to "place it on Lucky Dan", Lonnegan makes the $500,000 bet at Shaw's parlor on Lucky Dan to win. As the race begins, Harmon arrives and expresses shock at Lonnegan's bet, explaining that when he said "place it" he meant, literally, that Lucky Dan would "place" (i.e., <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Across_the_board" title="Across the board">finish <i>second</i></a>). In a panic, Lonnegan rushes the teller window and demands his money back. A moment later Polk, Lt. Snyder, and a half dozen FBI agents storm the parlor. Polk confronts Gondorff, then tells Hooker he is free to go. Gondorff, reacting to the betrayal, shoots Hooker in the back. Polk then shoots Gondorff and orders Snyder to get the ostensibly-respectable Lonnegan away from the crime scene. With Lonnegan and Snyder safely away, Hooker and Gondorff rise amid cheers and laughter. Agent Polk is actually Hickey, a con man, running a con atop Gondorff's con to divert Snyder and provide a solid "blow off". As the con men strip the room of its contents, Hooker refuses his share of the money, saying "I'd only blow it", and walks away with Gondorff.

The Tower, 1,688 feet tall and 138 stories, is the world's tallest building. During pre-dedication testing, an electrical short starts an undetected fire on the 81st floor. Roberts suspects that Roger Simmons, the electrical subcontractor and also Duncan's son-in-law, cut corners. Roberts confronts Simmons, who reveals nothing.
</p><p>During the dedication ceremony, at which Duncan is also trying to court US Senator Gary Parker in pursuit of a lucrative urban renewal contract, chief of Public Relations Dan Bigelow turns on all the tower's lights, but Roberts orders them shut off to reduce the load on the electrical system. Smoke is seen on the 81st floor, and the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Fire_Department" title="San Francisco Fire Department">San Francisco Fire Department</a> (SFFD) is summoned. Roberts and engineer Will Giddings go to the 81st floor, where Giddings is fatally burned pushing a guard away from the fire. Roberts reports the fire to Duncan, who refuses to order an evacuation.

Though the scenic elevator is still working, the stairways from the Promenade Room are blocked – one by fire, the other by mishandled cement. Just as the firemen begin to bring the fire under control, the electrical system fails, deactivating the passenger elevators; O’Halloran must <a href="/wiki/Abseiling" title="Abseiling">rappel</a> down the elevator shaft to safety.
</p><p>An attempt at a helicopter rescue fails when panicky partygoers rush the helipad, causing the helicopter to veer off, crash, and set the roof ablaze. Naval rescue teams attach a <a href="/wiki/Breeches_buoy" title="Breeches buoy">breeches buoy</a> to an adjacent skyscraper and rescue a number of guests, including Patty Simmons, Duncan's daughter. Roberts rigs a gravity brake on the scenic elevator, allowing one trip down for twelve people, including Lisolette and the children. An explosion near the 110th floor throws Lisolette from the elevator and leaves the elevator hanging by a single cable, but O’Halloran rescues the elevator with a Navy helicopter.
</p><p>As fire reaches the Promenade Room, a group of men led by Simmons attempts to commandeer the breeches buoy, which is subsequently destroyed in an explosion, killing Simmons, Parker and several other men. In a last-ditch strategy, O'Halloran and Roberts blow up water tanks atop the Tower with <a href="/wiki/Plastic_explosive" title="Plastic explosive">plastic explosives</a>. Most of the partygoers survive as water rushes through the ruined building, extinguishing the flames.

Roberts accepts O’Halloran’s offer of guidance on how to build a fire-safe skyscraper.  O’Halloran drives away, exhausted.
</p><p>On the <a href="/wiki/American_frontier" title="American frontier">American frontier</a> of 1874, a new railroad will soon be rerouted through Rock Ridge, in order to avoid running through <a href="/wiki/Quicksand" title="Quicksand">quicksand</a>. The conniving attorney general <a href="/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr" title="Hedy Lamarr">Hedley Lamarr</a> wants to force Rock Ridge's residents to abandon their town, and sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky Taggart, to shoot the sheriff and trash the town. The townspeople demand that Governor <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Le_Petomane" title="Le Petomane">William J. Le Petomane</a> appoint a new sheriff to protect them. Lamarr persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to appoint Bart, a black railroad worker, who was about to be executed for assaulting a white foreman. A black sheriff, he reasons, will offend the townspeople, create chaos, and leave the town at his mercy.
</p><p>After an initial hostile reception (where Sheriff Bart has to take himself hostage to escape), he relies on his quick wits and the assistance of Jim, an alcoholic gunslinger known as the "Waco Kid", to overcome the townspeople's hostility. He subdues Mongo, an immensely strong, dim-witted, but philosophical henchman sent to kill him; when he visits the railroad work site and discovers their interest in the land, the Waco Kid outshoots Taggart and his thugs; finally, Bart outmaneuvers German seductress-for-hire Lili von Shtüpp at her own game, with Lili falling in love with him. Lamarr, furious that his schemes have backfired, hatches a larger plan involving a recruited army of thugs, including common criminals, <a href="/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klansmen</a>, Nazis, and <a href="/wiki/Methodism" title="Methodism">Methodists</a>.
</p><p>Three miles east of Rock Ridge, Bart introduces the white townspeople to the black, Chinese, and Irish railroad workers, who have agreed to help in exchange for acceptance by the community, and explains his plan to defeat Lamarr's army. They labor all night to build a perfect replica of their town, as a diversion; with no people in it, though, Bart realizes it will not fool the villains. While the townspeople construct replicas of themselves, Bart, Jim, and Mongo buy time by constructing the "<a href="/wiki/New_York_State_Thruway" title="New York State Thruway">Gov. William J. Le Petomane Thruway</a>", forcing the raiding party to turn back for "a shitload of dimes" to pay the toll. Once through the tollbooth, the raiders attack the fake town populated with dummies, which are booby-trapped with dynamite bombs. After Jim detonates the bombs with his sharpshooting, launching bad guys and horses skyward, the Rock Ridgers storm the villains.
</p><p>The resulting brawl between townsfolk, railroad workers, and Lamarr's thugs breaks the <a href="/wiki/Fourth_wall" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a>, spilling onto a neighboring set, where director Buddy Bizarre is directing a <a href="/wiki/Busby_Berkeley" title="Busby Berkeley">Busby Berkeley</a>-style top-hat-and-tails musical number; then into the studio commissary for a food fight; and then out of the <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros._Studios,_Burbank" title="Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank">Warner Bros. film lot</a> into the streets of Burbank. Lamarr, realizing he has been beaten, hails a taxi and orders the driver to "drive me off this picture". He ducks into <a href="/wiki/Grauman%27s_Chinese_Theatre" title="Grauman's Chinese Theatre">Grauman's Chinese Theatre</a>, which is playing the premiere of <i>Blazing Saddles</i>. As he settles into his seat, he sees Bart arriving on horseback outside the theatre. Bart blocks Lamarr's escape, and then shoots him in the groin. Bart and Jim then go into Grauman's to watch the end of the film, in which Bart announces to the townspeople that he is moving on. Riding out of town, he finds Jim, and invites him along to "nowhere special". They ride off into the sunset on horseback, but stop at a chauffeured <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stretch_limousine" title="Stretch limousine">stretch limousine</a> and continue outward in the vehicle.
</p><p>During a beach party at dusk on Amity Island, <a href="/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a>, a young woman, Chrissie Watkins, goes <a href="/wiki/Nude_swimming" title="Nude swimming">skinny dipping</a> in the ocean. While <a href="/wiki/Treading_water" title="Treading water">treading water</a>, she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner's ruling that the death was due to a <a href="/wiki/Shark_attack" title="Shark attack">shark attack</a> leads police chief Martin Brody to close the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly thereafter. A bounty is placed on the shark, prompting an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, and confirms her death was caused by a shark—an unusually large one.
</p><p>When local fishermen catch a <a href="/wiki/Tiger_shark" title="Tiger shark">tiger shark</a>, the mayor proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes that it is the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable <a href="/wiki/Great_white_shark" title="Great white shark">great white shark</a>'s tooth embedded in the submerged hull. He drops it in fright after encountering a partial corpse. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's claims that a huge great white shark is responsible for the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank in which the presence of a shark is simulated, the real shark enters a nearby <a href="/wiki/Estuary" title="Estuary">estuary</a>, killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces Vaughn to hire Quint.
</p><p>Quint, Brody, and Hooper set out on Quint's boat, the <i>Orca</i>, to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a <a href="/wiki/Chumming" title="Chumming">chum</a> line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating its length at 25 feet (7.6 m) and weight at 3 tons, harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.
</p><p>At nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars and Quint reveals that he survived the <a href="/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)" title="USS Indianapolis (CA-35)">USS <i>Indianapolis</i></a>. The shark returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull, and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he intentionally pushes the damaged engine past the safety limits and the overtaxed engine fails.
</p><p>With the <i>Orca</i> slowly sinking, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on <a href="/wiki/Scuba_set" title="Scuba set">scuba gear</a> and enters the water in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shark-proof_cage" title="Shark-proof cage">shark-proof cage</a>, intending to lethally inject the shark with <a href="/wiki/Strychnine" title="Strychnine">strychnine</a>, using a hypodermic spear. The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly and devours Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody jams a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion obliterates the shark. Hooper surfaces, and he and Brody paddle back to Amity Island clinging to the remaining barrels.
</p><p>In late 1975, the <a href="/wiki/Heavyweight" title="Heavyweight">heavyweight</a> <a href="/wiki/Boxing" title="Boxing">boxing</a> world champion, Apollo Creed, announces plans to hold a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Title_bout" title="Title bout">title bout</a> in <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> during the upcoming <a href="/wiki/United_States_Bicentennial" title="United States Bicentennial">United States Bicentennial</a>. However, he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent is unable to compete due to an injured hand. With all other potential replacements booked up or otherwise unavailable, Creed decides to spice things up by giving a local contender a chance to challenge him. He settles in on <a href="/wiki/Rocky_Balboa" title="Rocky Balboa">Rocky Balboa</a>, an aspiring <a href="/wiki/Southpaw_stance" title="Southpaw stance">southpaw</a> boxer from an Italian neighborhood of Philadelphia, known by the nickname "The Italian Stallion".
</p><p>Rocky meets with <a href="/wiki/Promoter_(entertainment)" title="Promoter (entertainment)">promoter</a> Miles Jergens, unexpectedly presuming Creed is seeking local sparring partners. Reluctant at first, Rocky eventually agrees to the fight which will pay him $150,000. After several weeks of training, using whatever he can find, including meat carcasses as <a href="/wiki/Punching_bag" title="Punching bag">punching bags</a>, Rocky accepts an offer of assistance from gym proprietor Mickey "Mighty Mick" Goldmill, a respected trainer and former <a href="/wiki/Bantamweight" title="Bantamweight">bantamweight</a> fighter from the 1920s, who always criticized Rocky for wasting his potential.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Rocky meets Adrian Pennino, who is working part-time at the J&amp;M Tropical Fish <a href="/wiki/Pet_store" title="Pet store">pet store</a>. He begins to build a romantic relationship with Adrian, culminating in a kiss. Adrian's brother, Paulie, becomes jealous of Rocky's success, but Rocky calms him by agreeing to advertise his <a href="/wiki/Meat_packing_industry" title="Meat packing industry">meatpacking business</a> before the upcoming fight. The night before the fight, Rocky begins to lose confidence after touring the arena. He confesses to Adrian that he does not expect to win, but wants to <a href="/wiki/The_distance_(boxing)" title="The distance (boxing)">go the distance</a> against Creed, which no other fighter has done, and prove himself to everyone.
</p><p>On <a href="/wiki/New_Year%27s_Day" title="New Year's Day">New Year's Day</a>, the fight is held, with Creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as <a href="/wiki/George_Washington" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> and then <a href="/wiki/Uncle_Sam" title="Uncle Sam">Uncle Sam</a>. Taking advantage of his overconfidence, Rocky knocks him down in the first round—the first time that Creed has ever been knocked down. Humiliated, Creed takes Rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight, though his ego never fully fades. The fight goes on for the full fifteen rounds, with both combatants sustaining various injuries, Rocky with a detached retina in his right eye and hits to the head, and Apollo with internal bleeding and a broken rib. As the fight progresses, Creed's superior skill is countered by Rocky's apparently unlimited ability to absorb punches, and his dogged refusal to go down. As the final round bell sounds, with both fighters locked in each other's arms, they promise to each other that there will be no rematch.
</p><p>After the fight, the sportscasters and the audience go wild. Jergens announces over the loudspeaker that the fight was "the greatest exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the ring", and Rocky calls out repeatedly for Adrian, who runs down and comes into the ring as Paulie distracts arena security. As Jergens declares Creed the winner by virtue of a split decision (8:7, 7:8, 9:6), Adrian and Rocky embrace and profess their love to each other, not caring about the result of the fight.

</p><p>In the summer of 1958, <a href="/wiki/Greaser_(subculture)" title="Greaser (subculture)">greaser</a> Danny Zuko and sweet Australian girl Sandy Olsson meet at the beach and fall in love. When the summer comes to an end, Sandy, whose family is returning to Australia, worries that they might never meet again, but Danny tells her that their love is "only the beginning." At the beginning of the new school year at Rydell High School ("Grease"), Danny reunites with his fellow gang members, the T-Birds, of whom his best friend Kenickie, along with Doody, Sonny, and Putzie are members. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Danny, Sandy arrives at school, with her family's plans having changed, with her new friend Frenchy, a member of the Pink Ladies. Other Pink Ladies Rizzo, Marty, and Jan also arrive, excited to be seniors, as does Patty Simcox, a high-achieving cheerleader.
</p><p>At lunch, Frenchy introduces Sandy to the other Pink Ladies while Danny and the T-Birds make fun of practicing football players, including the handsome Tom Chisum. Each group asks Danny and Sandy, respectively, about their summers and they each independently describe their romance without using the other's name, with Sandy's description far more innocent than Danny's ("Summer Nights"). Headed back to class, Sandy reveals that it was Danny Zuko she met, and Rizzo teases that perhaps she'll meet him again.
</p><p>At a pep rally before a <a href="/wiki/American_football" title="American football">football</a> game, Sandy and Patty perform as cheerleaders; there, Sandy and Tom flirt.  Kenickie arrives with a used car he plans on rebuilding so he can race it at Thunder Road, a popular <a href="/wiki/Street_racing" title="Street racing">street race</a> spot; as he says this, Leo Balmudo, a rival greaser from the Scorpions, drives by in a menacing manner. Rizzo puts Sandy and Danny together, surprising both of them.  Sandy is thrilled to see Danny, but he is obnoxious and indifferent, upsetting Sandy. Frenchy invites Sandy to a sleepover with the Pink Ladies to cheer her up.
</p><p>Rizzo and the other girls pressure Sandy into smoking a cigarette and having a drink of wine at the sleepover. Frenchy reveals that she plans to drop out of Rydell to go to beauty school and in an effort to prove herself, tries to pierce Sandy's ear, making Sandy sick. Rizzo makes fun of her innocent nature ("Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee") and leaves when the T-Birds arrive in Kenickie's car. Rizzo tries to make Danny jealous by flirting with Kenickie, but Danny is unmoved and leaves.  Kenickie leaves with Rizzo, stranding Putzie, Sonny, and Doody. Sandy laments over her feelings towards Danny, despite his earlier behavior ("Hopelessly Devoted to You").
</p><p>Kenickie and Rizzo, while in the midst of sex, are interrupted when Leo, along with his girlfriend Cha-Cha, deliberately crashes his own street racer into Kenickie's and insults Rizzo. At the same time, Kenickie's condom breaks.
</p><p>The next day, the T-Birds look over Kenickie's car, and although they are initially skeptical of its potential, Danny and Kenickie explain the modifications they could add to make it a hot-rodding sex machine ("Greased Lightnin'"). At the popular hangout The Frosty Palace, Danny, after brushing off an attempt by Patty to flirt with him, apologizes to Sandy for his behavior at the pep rally, but she rejects him having started dating Tom instead. Danny approaches Coach Calhoun about playing a sport.

</p><p>Danny takes Sandy to the Frosty Palace for a date; they are soon joined by the rest of the greasers, and Danny and Sandy quickly leave in discomfort. Putzie and Jan, in an awkward exchange, agree to pair off for the dance; Kenickie and Rizzo get into an argument and go their separate ways, while Sonny unsuccessfully tries to court Marty. After everyone else has left, Frenchy, whose hair has turned bright pink, tells a waitress she has dropped out of beauty school and is visited by a <a href="/wiki/Guardian_angel" title="Guardian angel">guardian angel</a> who advises her to return to Rydell ("Beauty School Dropout").
</p><p>At the school dance, Leo and Cha-Cha show up as Rizzo's and Kenickie's respective dates. Vince Fontaine, who is hosting a live telecast of the dance, flirts with Marty. All of the students take part in a dance contest that descends into chaos ("Born to Hand Jive"). Danny and Sandy do well, but Sonny pulls Sandy off the dance floor, allowing Cha Cha to step in and win with Danny. During the last dance ("Blue Moon"), Sonny, Putzie, and Doody <a href="/wiki/Mooning" title="Mooning">moon</a> the national TV audience.
</p><p>Danny apologizes to Sandy and tries to make it up to her by taking her to a drive-in movie theater. She's unmoved by his pleas for forgiveness until he asks her to wear his ring, which she gleefully accepts. Danny then tries to make out with her, causing Sandy to angrily throw his ring at him and run off in disgust, leaving Danny distraught ("Sandy"). Meanwhile, Rizzo admits she may be pregnant to Marty and asks her to keep it a secret, but the story gets back to Kenickie, and he tells Rizzo he doesn't run away from his mistakes. Rizzo tells Kenickie the baby isn't his, which both relieves and upsets him.
</p><p>The next day, the T-Birds have finished Kenickie's car and he is eager to race it against Leo's at Thunder Road. Sandy tells Rizzo she plans to watch the race and offers to help Rizzo despite the rumors about Rizzo's character that have been spread around school. She thanks Sandy and muses to herself about how her sins are not as bad as they could be ("There Are Worse Things I Could Do").
</p><p>The T-Birds, Pink Ladies, and Scorpions gather for the race, with the winner receiving the loser's car as a prize. Just before the race begins, Kenickie hits his head, and Danny takes the wheel. Despite Leo using bladed hub caps (in a sequence paying homage to <i><a href="/wiki/Ben-Hur_(1959_film)" title="Ben-Hur (1959 film)">Ben-Hur</a></i>), Danny wins the race. Sandy watches from afar and concludes that she must change her approach to life if she wants to win over Danny, asking Frenchy for help ("Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee (Reprise)").
</p><p>The gang celebrates graduation at a school carnival where Rizzo tells Kenickie she isn't pregnant and they reunite. Danny arrives wearing a <a href="/wiki/Letterman_(sports)" title="Letterman (sports)">letterman's</a> sweater, to the other T-Birds' dismay. Sandy shocks everyone when she arrives with a new, wilder hairstyle and wearing a revealing black outfit and leather jacket. In song, Danny and Sandy reaffirm their commitment to each other ("You're the One That I Want"). As the film ends, the greasers promise to stay together after school ends ("We Go Together") and Danny and Sandy depart in a red hot rod, which takes flight as they wave goodbye to their friends.

The shuttles dock with Drax's <a href="/wiki/Space_station" title="Space station">space station</a>, hidden from radar by a <a href="/wiki/Cloaking_device" title="Cloaking device">cloaking device</a>.
</p><p>Bond and Goodhead disable the <a href="/wiki/Radar_jamming_and_deception" title="Radar jamming and deception">radar jamming</a> cloaking device; the United States sends a platoon of <a href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps" title="United States Marine Corps">Marines</a> aboard another shuttle to intercept the now-visible space station. Jaws captures Bond and Goodhead, to whom Drax reveals his plan to destroy human life by launching 50 globes that would dispense the nerve gas into Earth's atmosphere. Drax had transported several dozen genetically perfect young men and women of varying races to the space station in the shuttles. They would live there until Earth was safe again for human life; their descendants would be the seed for a "new master race". Bond persuades Jaws to switch his allegiance by getting Drax to admit that anyone not measuring up to his physical standards, including Dolly, would be exterminated. Jaws attacks Drax's guards, and a laser battle ensues between Drax's forces and Bond, Jaws, and the Marines. Drax's forces are defeated as the station is destroyed, while Bond shoots and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Space_exposure" title="Space exposure">ejects Drax into space</a>. Bond and Goodhead use Drax's laser-armed <i>Moonraker 5</i> to destroy the three launched globes and return to Earth.
</p><p>On New Year's Day in 1976, world heavyweight boxing champion <a href="/wiki/Rocky" title="Rocky">Apollo Creed has successfully defended his title in a split decision</a> against challenger <a href="/wiki/Rocky_Balboa" title="Rocky Balboa">Rocky Balboa</a>. He and Rocky are taken to the same hospital. Apollo challenges Rocky to a rematch, but Rocky declines and retires from <a href="/wiki/Professional_boxing" title="Professional boxing">professional boxing</a>. His girlfriend, Adrian, supports his choice, and so do his doctors, who reveal that he will require surgery for a <a href="/wiki/Retinal_detachment" title="Retinal detachment">detached retina</a>, a condition that could lead to permanent blindness. In a private moment, Rocky goes to see a recuperating Apollo, and wants a truthful response to his question of whether Apollo gave his all in the fight; Creed confirms that he did. After Rocky is released from the hospital, he enjoys the benefits of his life's changes: Rocky's new fame attracts an agent who sees Rocky as a potential endorsement and sponsorship goldmine, and his sudden wealth encourages him to propose to Adrian. She happily accepts, and they marry in a small ceremony. Soon after, Adrian reveals that she is pregnant.
</p><p>Meanwhile, fueled by hate mail, Apollo becomes obsessed with the idea that a rematch is the only way to prove that Rocky's performance was simply a fluke. Determined to rectify his boxing career's only blemish, Apollo ignores all pleas by his friends and family to forget the fight, and move on to other potential opponents, and instead demands his team do whatever necessary to goad Rocky out of retirement and have a rematch with him.
</p><p>Rocky, at first, seems unaffected by Apollo's smear campaign, but his inexperience with money causes him to run into financial problems. After several unsuccessful attempts to find employment, Rocky visits Mickey Goldmill, his trainer and manager, at his gym to talk about the possibility of returning to boxing. At first, Mickey declines, concerned about Rocky's health, but he soon accepts after Apollo publicly insults Rocky. Adrian confronts Rocky about the danger of returning to boxing and reminds him of the risk to his eyesight. Rocky argues that he knows nothing else, so this is the only way he can provide. Adrian, furious at Rocky for breaking his promise, refuses to support him.
</p><p>Rocky and Mickey begin training, but Rocky's mind is not fully set due to Adrian's disapproval. Adrian's brother, Paulie, confronts his sister about not supporting her husband, but she faints during the confrontation, and is rushed to the hospital, where she goes into labor. Despite being premature, the baby is healthy, but Adrian falls into a coma. Rocky blames himself for what happened, refusing to leave Adrian's bedside until she wakes up, and will not go to see his new baby until they can see it together. When Adrian comes out of her coma, she finds Rocky by her bedside, and the couple are shown their new baby, a boy, which they name Robert "Rocky Jr." Adrian gives her blessing to the rematch, and Rocky quickly gets into shape for the match. 
</p><p>The night of the match arrives, and Apollo makes a public goal of beating Rocky in no more than two rounds to prove the first match going the full fifteen rounds was a fluke. Rocky, fighting right-handed to protect his eye instead of his natural <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Southpaw" title="Southpaw">southpaw</a>, is knocked down twice by Creed and outclassed for much of the fight. As with their first fight, this match goes the full fifteen rounds, by which time Creed is well ahead on points and only needs to stay away from Balboa to win the fight by decision. However, Creed, not wanting the fight to end like it did the first time, ignores his trainer's pleas to stay back and attempts to beat Rocky by knockout. In the final round, Rocky switches back to his natural stance, and in dramatic fashion, unleashes a series of counter punches on Creed, turning the tide. Both men, exhausted, trade punches until they knock each other down. Apollo gets up on the ropes early while Rocky is on the canvas and has to make his way over. Rocky is able to will himself up on 9 while Apollo collapses from exhaustion, giving Rocky the win by knockout, making him the new heavyweight champion. Rocky then gives an impassioned speech to the crowd and holds the belt over his head with a message for his wife, who is watching the fight on TV: "Yo, Adrian, I did it!"

</p><p>Meanwhile, the probe alerts the Imperial fleet to the Rebels' location. The Empire launches a large-scale attack using <a href="/wiki/Walker_(Star_Wars)" title="Walker (Star Wars)">AT-AT walkers</a> to capture the base, which forces the Rebels to retreat. Han and Leia escape with <span class="nowrap"><a href="/wiki/C-3PO" title="C-3PO">C-3PO</a></span> and <a href="/wiki/Chewbacca" title="Chewbacca">Chewbacca</a> on the <i><a href="/wiki/Millennium_Falcon" title="Millennium Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a></i>, but the ship's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hyperspace_(science_fiction)" title="Hyperspace (science fiction)">hyperdrive</a> malfunctions.

He meets a diminutive creature who reveals himself to be Yoda; after conferring with Obi-Wan's spirit, Yoda reluctantly accepts Luke as his student.
</p><p>After evading the Imperial fleet, Han's group travels to the floating Cloud City on the gas planet of <a href="/wiki/Bespin" title="Bespin">Bespin</a>, which is run by Han's old friend, <a href="/wiki/Lando_Calrissian" title="Lando Calrissian">Lando Calrissian</a>. Unbeknownst to the group, the bounty hunter <a href="/wiki/Boba_Fett" title="Boba Fett">Boba Fett</a> has tracked the <i>Falcon</i>; shortly after their arrival, Lando hands the group over to Darth Vader. Vader plans to use the group as bait to lure out Luke, intending to capture him and take him to Emperor <a href="/wiki/Palpatine" title="Palpatine">Palpatine</a>. Luke experiences a premonition of Han and Leia in pain and, against the wishes of Yoda and Obi-Wan, abandons his training to rescue them, promising to return and complete his training.
</p><p>Intending to hold Luke in <a href="/wiki/Suspended_animation" title="Suspended animation">suspended animation</a> via carbon freezing, Vader selects Han to be frozen as a test subject. Han survives the process and is given to Fett, who plans to collect the bounty on Han from <a href="/wiki/Jabba_the_Hutt" title="Jabba the Hutt">Jabba the Hutt</a>. Lando frees Leia and Chewbacca, but they are too late to stop Fett from departing with Han. They fight their way back to the <i>Falcon</i> and flee the city. Meanwhile, Luke arrives and engages Vader in a lightsaber duel that leads them over the city's central air shaft. Vader severs Luke's right hand, disarming him, and tempts him to join forces. Luke accuses Vader of murdering his father, but Vader reveals that <i>he</i> is Luke's father. Horrified, Luke drops into the air shaft and is ejected beneath the floating city, where he hangs on an antenna. He reaches out <a href="/wiki/Telepathy" title="Telepathy">telepathically</a> to Leia, who senses him and persuades Lando to turn back.

</p><p>Rejoined with the Rebel fleet, Luke's severed hand is replaced with a <a href="/wiki/Prosthesis" title="Prosthesis">robotic hand</a>. Lando and Chewbacca take off in the <i>Falcon</i> with hopes of saving Han.
</p><p>In 1936, American archaeologist <a href="/wiki/Indiana_Jones" title="Indiana Jones">Indiana Jones</a> braves an ancient booby-trapped temple in <a href="/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a> and retrieves a <a href="/wiki/Golden_Idol" title="Golden Idol">golden idol</a>. He is confronted by rival archaeologist <a href="/wiki/List_of_Indiana_Jones_characters#René_Belloq" title="List of Indiana Jones characters">René Belloq</a> and the indigenous <a href="/wiki/Jibito" title="Jibito">Hovito</a> people. Surrounded and outnumbered, Jones surrenders the idol to Belloq and escapes aboard a waiting <a href="/wiki/Floatplane" title="Floatplane">floatplane</a>, where he uncomfortably shares his seat with the pilot's pet snake.
</p><p>Jones returns to his teaching position at Marshall College in the fictional town of Bedford, <a href="/wiki/Connecticut" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, where he is interviewed by two <a href="/wiki/Military_Intelligence_Corps_(United_States_Army)" title="Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)">Army Intelligence</a> agents. They inform Jones that the <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazis</a> are searching for his old mentor, Abner Ravenwood, under whom Jones studied at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>. The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of <a href="/wiki/Tanis" title="Tanis">Tanis</a> in <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Egypt" title="Kingdom of Egypt">Egypt</a>, and that he possesses the headpiece of an <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egyptian</a> artifact known as "the Staff of <a href="/wiki/Ra" title="Ra">Ra</a>". Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the <a href="/wiki/Ark_of_the_Covenant" title="Ark of the Covenant">Ark of the Covenant</a> — the Nazis believe that if they acquire the Ark, their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra (used to project a beam of <a href="/wiki/Sunlight" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a> on a building in a diorama of the city) is the key to finding the <a href="/wiki/Well_of_Souls" title="Well of Souls">Well of Souls</a>, a secret chamber in Tanis, Egypt, in which the Ark is buried.
</p><p>The agents authorize Jones to recover the Ark to prevent the Nazis from obtaining it. He travels to <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Nepal" title="Kingdom of Nepal">Nepal</a> and discovers that Ravenwood has died, and the headpiece is in the possession of Ravenwood's daughter <a href="/wiki/Marion_Ravenwood" title="Marion Ravenwood">Marion</a>. Jones visits Marion at her <a href="/wiki/Tavern" title="Tavern">tavern</a>, where she reveals her bitter feelings toward him from a previous romantic affair. She physically rebuffs his offer to buy the headpiece, and Jones leaves. Shortly after, a group of thugs arrive with their Nazi commander <a href="/wiki/List_of_Indiana_Jones_characters#Arnold_Ernst_Toht" title="List of Indiana Jones characters">Arnold Toht</a>, who had followed Jones on his flight leaving the United States. Toht threatens Marion to get the headpiece but Jones returns to the bar and fights the Nazis to save Marion. During the fight, the bar is set ablaze and the headpiece lands in the flames. Toht severely burns his hand trying to take the hot headpiece and flees the tavern screaming in agony. Jones and Marion escape with the headpiece, and Marion decides to accompany Jones in his search for the Ark so he can repay his debt to her.
</p><p>The pair travels to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cairo,_Egypt" title="Cairo, Egypt">Cairo, Egypt</a>, where they meet up with Jones' friend and skilled digger <a href="/wiki/Sallah" title="Sallah">Sallah</a>. Sallah informs them that Belloq and the Nazis are digging for the Well of Souls with a replica of the headpiece (created from the scar on Toht's hand). They quickly realize the Nazi headpiece is incomplete and that the Nazis are digging in the wrong place. The Nazis kidnap Marion and it appears to Jones that she is killed in an exploding truck. After a confrontation with Belloq in a local bar, Jones and Sallah infiltrate the Nazi dig site and use their staff to correctly locate the Ark. Jones discovers Marion is alive when he finds her bound and gagged in a tent. He refuses to release her out of fear of alerting the Nazis. Jones, Sallah, and a small group of diggers unearth the Well of Souls and acquire the Ark. Belloq and Nazi officer <a href="/wiki/List_of_Indiana_Jones_characters#Colonel_Dietrich" title="List of Indiana Jones characters">Colonel Dietrich</a> arrive and seize the Ark from Jones, throwing Marion into the Well of Souls with him before sealing it back up. Jones and Marion escape to a local airstrip, where Jones has a fistfight with a Nazi mechanic and destroys the <a href="/wiki/Flying_wing" title="Flying wing">flying wing</a> that was to transport the Ark to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Berlin,_Germany" title="Berlin, Germany">Berlin, Germany</a>. The panicked Nazis remove the Ark in a truck and set off for Cairo, but Jones catches them and retakes it. He makes arrangements to take the Ark to <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> aboard <a href="/wiki/Tramp_trade" title="Tramp trade">tramp steamer</a> <i>Bantu Wild</i>.
</p><p>The next day, a Nazi <a href="/wiki/U-boat" title="U-boat">U-boat</a> appears and intercepts the ship. Belloq and Dietrich seize the Ark and Marion but cannot locate Jones, who stows away aboard the U-boat and travels with them to an island in the <a href="/wiki/Aegean_Sea" title="Aegean Sea">Aegean Sea</a>. Once there, Belloq plans to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Hitler</a>. Jones reveals himself and threatens to destroy the Ark with an anti-tank rocket, but Belloq calls his bluff and Jones surrenders rather than destroy such an important historical artifact and kill Marion in the process. The Nazis take Jones and Marion to an area where the Ark will be opened and tie them to a post to observe. Belloq, dressed as an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Israelite" title="Israelite">Israelite</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/High_priest_of_Israel" title="High priest of Israel">kohen gadol</a>, performs a ceremonial opening of the Ark and finds it full of sand. Spirits emerge from the Ark, destroying the equipment the Nazis are using to film the opening, and Jones tells Marion to close her eyes and not look. Belloq and the others look on in astonishment as the ghosts are suddenly revealed to be <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/angel_of_death" title="wikt:angel of death">angels of death</a>.  A <a href="/wiki/Pillar_of_Fire_(theophany)" title="Pillar of Fire (theophany)">vortex of flame</a> forms above the Ark and shoots bolts of fiery energy into the gathered Nazi soldiers, killing them all.  Belloq, Toht and Dietrich all scream in terror as the Ark turns its fury on them: Dietrich's head shrivels up, Toht's face is melted off his skull and Belloq's head explodes.  Flames then engulf the remains of the doomed assembly, save for Jones and Marion, and the pillar of fire rises into the sky.  The Ark's lid is blasted high into the air before dropping back down onto the Ark and sealing it.  Jones and Marion find their ropes burned off and embrace.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, the Army Intelligence agents inform Jones and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Indiana_Jones_characters#Marcus_Brody" title="List of Indiana Jones characters">Marcus Brody</a> that the Ark is someplace safe and will be studied by "top men". The Ark is then shown being stored in a giant government warehouse (<a href="/wiki/Area_51" title="Area 51">Hangar 51</a>) among countless similar crates.
</p><p>A group of alien botanists secretly visit <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> under cover of night to gather plant specimens in a California forest. When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, but in their haste, one of them is left behind. In a suburban neighborhood in the <a href="/wiki/San_Fernando_Valley" title="San Fernando Valley">San Fernando Valley</a>, a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves <a href="/wiki/Reese%27s_Pieces" title="Reese's Pieces">Reese's Pieces</a> candy to lure the alien to his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its <a href="/wiki/Planetary_system" title="Planetary system">planetary system</a> and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead <a href="/wiki/Chrysanthemum" title="Chrysanthemum">chrysanthemums</a>.
</p><p>At school the next day, Elliott begins to experience a psychic connection with the alien, including exhibiting signs of intoxication (because it is at his home, drinking beer and watching <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tom_%26_Jerry" title="Tom &amp; Jerry">Tom &amp; Jerry</a></i>), and he begins freeing all the frogs in his biology class. As the alien watches <a href="/wiki/John_Wayne" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a> kiss <a href="/wiki/Maureen_O%27Hara" title="Maureen O'Hara">Maureen O'Hara</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Quiet_Man" title="The Quiet Man">The Quiet Man</a></i> on television, Elliott then kisses a girl he likes in the same manner and he is sent to the principal's office.
</p><p>The alien learns to speak English by repeating what Gertie says as she watches <i><a href="/wiki/Sesame_Street" title="Sesame Street">Sesame Street</a></i> and, at Elliott's urging, dubs itself "E.T." E.T. reads a comic strip where <a href="/wiki/Buck_Rogers" title="Buck Rogers">Buck Rogers</a>, stranded, calls for help by building a makeshift communication device and is inspired to try it himself. E.T. receives Elliott's help in building a device to "phone home" by using a <a href="/wiki/Speak_%26_Spell_(toy)" title="Speak &amp; Spell (toy)">Speak &amp; Spell</a> toy. Michael notices that E.T.'s health is declining and that Elliott is referring to himself as "we".
</p><p>On <a href="/wiki/Halloween" title="Halloween">Halloween</a>, Michael and Elliott dress E.T. as a ghost so they can sneak him out of the house. That night, Elliott and E.T. head through the forest, where they make a successful call home. The next day, Elliott wakes up in the field, only to find E.T. gone. Elliott returns home to his distressed family. Michael searches for and finds E.T. dying next to a culvert. Michael takes E.T. home to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son's illness and the dying alien, just as government agents invade the house. Scientists set up a hospital at the house, questioning Michael, Mary and Gertie while treating Elliott and E.T. Their connection disappears and E.T. then appears to die while Elliott recovers. A grief-stricken Elliott is left alone with the motionless E.T. when he notices a dead chrysanthemum, the plant E.T. had previously revived, coming back to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael's friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bicycles. Suddenly facing a police roadblock, they escape as E.T. uses <a href="/wiki/Psychokinesis" title="Psychokinesis">telekinesis</a> to lift them into the air and toward the forest, like he had done for Elliott before.
</p><p>Standing near the spaceship, E.T.'s heart glows as he prepares to return home. Mary, Gertie, and "Keys", a friendly government agent, show up. E.T. says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, as she presents him with the chrysanthemum that he had revived. Before boarding the spaceship, he embraces Elliott and tells him "I'll be right here", pointing his glowing finger to Elliott's forehead. He then picks up the chrysanthemum, boards the spaceship, and it takes off, leaving a rainbow in the sky as everyone watches it leave.

With his 11-year-old Chinese sidekick Short Round and the nightclub singer Willie Scott in tow, Indy flees Shanghai on an airplane that, unbeknownst to them, is owned by Lao. While the three of them are asleep on the plane, the pilots dump the fuel and parachute out, leaving the plane to crash over the Himalayas. Indy, Shorty, and Willie discover this and narrowly manage to escape by jumping out of the plane on an inflatable raft, and then riding down the slopes into a raging river. They come to Mayapore, a village in northern India, whose impoverished villagers believe the three to have been sent by <a href="/wiki/Shiva" title="Shiva">Shiva</a> to retrieve the sacred <a href="/wiki/Lingam" title="Lingam">sivalinga</a> stone stolen from their shrine, as well as the community's missing children, from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace. During the journey to Pankot, Indy hypothesizes that the stone may be one of the five fabled Sankara stones that promise fortune and glory.
</p><p>The trio receive a warm welcome from the Prime Minister of Pankot Palace, Chattar Lal. The visitors are allowed to stay the night as guests, during which they attend a lavish but grotesque banquet given by the young <a href="/wiki/Maharaja" title="Maharaja">Maharaja</a>, Zalim Singh. Chattar Lal rebuffs Indy's questions about the villagers' claims and his theory that the ancient <a href="/wiki/Thuggee" title="Thuggee">Thuggee</a> cult is responsible for their troubles. Later that night, Indy is attacked by an assassin, leading Indy, Willie, and Shorty to believe that something is amiss. After Indy kills the assassin, they discover a series of tunnels hidden behind a statue in Willie's room and set out to explore them, overcoming a number of booby-traps along the way.
</p><p>The trio eventually reach an underground temple where the Thugs worship <a href="/wiki/Kali" title="Kali">Kali</a> with human sacrifice. They watch as the Thugs chain one of their victims in a cage and slowly lower him into a ceremonial lava pit, burning him alive. They discover that the Thugs, led by their high priest Mola Ram, are in possession of three of the five Sankara stones, and have enslaved the children to mine for the last two. As Indy tries to retrieve the stones, he, Willie, and Shorty are captured and separated. Indy is <a href="/wiki/Flagellation" title="Flagellation">whipped</a> and forced to drink a potion called the Blood of Kali, which places him in a trance-like state where he begins to mindlessly serve the Thugs. Willie, meanwhile, is kept as a human sacrifice, while Shorty is whipped and put to work in the mines alongside the children. Shorty breaks free and escapes back into the temple where he burns Indy with a torch, bringing him back to his senses. After fighting off the guards and defeating Chattar Lal, Indy stops Willie's cage and cranks it out of the pit just in time to save her from the fire, while Mola Ram escapes. Indy retrieves the Sankara stones, and the three return to the mines to free the children. As Indy fights a hulking overseer, the Maharaja—also under Mola Ram's control—tries to cripple him with a voodoo doll. Shorty knocks the doll away and burns him to break the trance, and a restored Indy escapes and leaves the overseer to die in a rock crusher.
</p><p>The trio escape from the temple in a mine cart, pursued by Thugs, while Mola Ram orders a water cistern dumped in an attempt to flood them out. After barely escaping the deluge, they are again cornered by Mola Ram and his henchmen on a rope bridge high above a crocodile-infested river. Indy cuts the rope bridge in half with one man's sword, leaving everyone to hang on for their lives. As he and Mola Ram struggle over the stones, he invokes the name of <a href="/wiki/Shiva" title="Shiva">Shiva</a>, causing them to glow white-hot. Mola Ram burns his hand on the stones, causing him to lose his grip and fall to his death; Indy catches the last one safely and climbs up as a company of <a href="/wiki/British_Indian_Army" title="British Indian Army">British Indian Army</a> riflemen, summoned by the Maharaja, arrive and open fire on the Thuggee archers trying to shoot him. Indy, Willie, and Shorty return to Mayapore with the children and give the missing stone back to the villagers.
</p><p>In 1985 <a href="/wiki/Hill_Valley_(Back_to_the_Future)" title="Hill Valley (Back to the Future)">Hill Valley, California</a>, teenager <a href="/wiki/Marty_McFly" title="Marty McFly">Marty McFly</a> and his girlfriend, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jennifer_Parker" title="Jennifer Parker">Jennifer Parker</a>, are chastised by the school principal for lateness. Marty auditions for the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Bands" title="Battle of the Bands">Battle of the Bands</a>, but is rejected for being too loud. At home, Marty's father <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/George_McFly" title="George McFly">George</a> is bullied by his supervisor, <a href="/wiki/Biff_Tannen" title="Biff Tannen">Biff Tannen</a>, while his mother <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lorraine_Baines_McFly" title="Lorraine Baines McFly">Lorraine</a> is an overweight, depressed alcoholic. Lorraine recalls how she met George when her father hit him with his car.
</p><p>Marty is invited by his friend, eccentric inventor <a href="/wiki/Emmett_Brown" title="Emmett Brown">Dr. Emmett Brown</a>, to meet him in a parking lot in the early hours. Doc unveils a <a href="/wiki/DeLorean_time_machine" title="DeLorean time machine">time machine built from a modified DeLorean</a> and powered by <a href="/wiki/Plutonium" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> stolen from terrorists. Preparing to demonstrate the time machine, Doc sets the date to November 5, 1955: the day he invented a time travel device. The terrorists arrive and shoot Doc. Marty escapes in the DeLorean, but inadvertently activates the time machine.
</p><p>Marty finds himself in 1955 without enough plutonium to return. He encounters the teenage George, who is bullied by his classmate Biff. After Marty saves George from an oncoming car, he is knocked unconscious and awakens to find himself tended to by Lorraine, who is infatuated with him.
</p><p>Marty tracks down Doc's younger self for help. With no plutonium, Doc explains that the only power source capable of generating the necessary 1.21 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gigawatts" title="Gigawatts">gigawatts</a> of electricity for the time machine is a bolt of lightning. Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that recounts a lightning strike at the town's courthouse due the coming Saturday night. Doc instructs Marty to not leave his house or interact with anyone, as he could inadvertently <a href="/wiki/Temporal_paradox" title="Temporal paradox">alter the future</a>; because of this, Doc refuses to heed warnings from Marty about his death in 1985. When they realize that he has prevented his parents from meeting, Doc warns Marty that he must find a way to introduce George to Lorraine or he will be erased from existence. Doc formulates a plan to harness the power of the lightning, while Marty sets about introducing his parents.
</p><p>After Lorraine asks Marty to the school dance, Marty concocts a plan: he will feign inappropriate advances on Lorraine, allowing George to "rescue" her. The plan goes awry when a drunken Biff attempts to force himself on Lorraine. George, enraged, knocks out Biff, and Lorraine follows him to the dance floor, where they kiss while Marty performs with the band.
</p><p>As the storm arrives, Marty returns to the clock tower and the lightning strikes, sending Marty back to 1985. Doc has survived the shooting, as he had listened to Marty's warnings and worn a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bullet-proof_vest" title="Bullet-proof vest">bullet-proof vest</a>. Doc takes Marty home and departs to the future. Marty awakens the next morning to find that George is a successful author, Lorraine is fit and happy, and Biff is now an obsequious <a href="/wiki/Auto_detailing" title="Auto detailing">auto valet</a>. As Marty reunites with Jennifer, the DeLorean appears with Doc, insisting they accompany him to <a href="/wiki/Back_to_the_Future_Part_II" title="Back to the Future Part II">2015</a> to resolve a problem with their future children. The trio board the DeLorean, which has been upgraded with hover technology, and warp to the future.

While Maverick drives off the remaining MiG-28, Cougar is too shaken to land, and Maverick, defying orders, shepherds him back to the carrier. Cougar gives up his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wings_of_Gold" title="Wings of Gold">wings</a>, citing his newborn child that he has never seen. Despite his dislike for Maverick's recklessness, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Commander,_Air_Group" title="Commander, Air Group">CAG</a> "Stinger" sends him and Goose to attend Topgun<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup>, the Naval Fighter Weapons School at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Naval_Air_Station_Miramar" title="Naval Air Station Miramar">Naval Air Station Miramar</a>.
</p><p>At a bar the day before Topgun starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman. He learns the next day that she is Charlotte "Charlie" Blackwood, an <a href="/wiki/Astrophysics" title="Astrophysics">astrophysicist</a> and civilian Topgun instructor. She becomes interested in Maverick upon learning of his inverted maneuver with the MiG-28, which disproves US intelligence on the enemy aircraft's performance.
</p><p>During Maverick's first training sortie he defeats instructor LCDR Rick "Jester" Heatherly but through reckless flying breaks two <a href="/wiki/Rules_of_engagement" title="Rules of engagement">rules of engagement</a> and is reprimanded by chief instructor CDR Mike "Viper" Metcalf. Maverick also becomes a rival to top student LT Tom "Iceman" Kazansky, who considers Maverick's flying "dangerous." Charlie also objects to Maverick's aggressive tactics but eventually admits that she admires his flying and omitted it from her reports to hide her feelings for him, and the two begin a romantic relationship.
</p><p>During a training sortie, Maverick abandons his wingman "Hollywood" to chase Viper, but is defeated when Viper maneuvers Maverick into a position from which his wingman Jester can shoot down Maverick from behind, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual prowess.
</p><p>Maverick and Iceman, now direct competitors for the Topgun Trophy, chase an <a href="/wiki/Douglas_A-4_Skyhawk" title="Douglas A-4 Skyhawk">A-4</a> in a later training engagement. Maverick pressures Iceman to break off his engagement so he can shoot it down, but Maverick's F-14 flies through the <a href="/wiki/Wake_turbulence" title="Wake turbulence">jet wash</a> of Iceman's aircraft and suffers a <a href="/wiki/Flameout" title="Flameout">flameout</a> of both engines, going into an unrecoverable <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spin_(flight)" title="Spin (flight)">flat spin</a>.

</p><p>Although the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility for Goose's death, he is overcome by guilt and his flying skill diminishes. Charlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers retiring. He seeks advice from Viper, who reveals that he served with Maverick's father Duke Mitchell on the <a href="/wiki/USS_Oriskany_(CV-34)" title="USS Oriskany (CV-34)">USS <i>Oriskany</i></a> and was in the air battle in which Mitchell was killed. Contrary to official reports which faulted Mitchell, Viper reveals classified information that proves Mitchell died heroically, and informs Maverick that he can succeed if he can regain his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate, though Iceman wins the Top Gun Trophy.
</p><p>During the graduation party, Viper calls in the newly graduated aviators with the orders to deploy. Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately return to <i>Enterprise</i> to deal with a "crisis situation", providing air support for the rescue of a stricken ship that has drifted into hostile waters.
</p><p>Maverick and Merlin (Cougar's former RIO) are assigned as back-up for F-14s flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman's reservations over Maverick's state of mind. The subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs sees Hollywood shot down; Maverick is scrambled alone due to a <a href="/wiki/Aircraft_catapult" title="Aircraft catapult">catapult</a> failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose's death. Upon finally rejoining Iceman, Maverick shoots down three MiGs, and Iceman one, forcing the other two to flee. Upon their triumphant return to <i>Enterprise</i>, Iceman and Maverick express newfound respect for each other.
</p><p>Offered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to Topgun as an instructor. At a bar in Miramar, Maverick and Charlie reunite.
</p><p>Dan Gallagher is a successful, happily married <a href="/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> lawyer whose work leads him to meet Alexandra "Alex" Forrest, an editor for a <a href="/wiki/Publishing" title="Publishing">publishing company</a>. While his wife, Beth, and daughter, Ellen, are out of town for the weekend, Dan has an affair with Alex. Though it was initially understood by both as just a fling, Alex starts clinging to him.
</p><p>Dan spends a second unplanned evening with Alex after she persistently asks him over. When Dan tries to leave, she cuts her wrists in a suicide attempt. He helps her bandage the cuts and then leaves. He thinks the affair is forgotten, but she shows up at various places to see him. She waits at his office one day to apologize and invites him to a performance of <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Madame_Butterfly" title="Madame Butterfly">Madame Butterfly</a></i>, but he politely turns her down. She then continues to call him until he tells his secretary that he will no longer take her calls. Alex then phones his home at all hours, claiming that she is pregnant and plans to keep the baby. Although he wants nothing to do with her, she argues that he must take responsibility. After he changes his home phone number, she shows up at his apartment (which is for sale) and meets Beth, feigning interest as a buyer. Later that night, Dan goes to Alex's apartment to confront her, which results in a scuffle. In response, she replies that she will not be ignored.
</p><p>Dan moves his family to <a href="/wiki/Bedford_(town),_New_York" title="Bedford (town), New York">Bedford</a>, but this does not deter Alex. She has a tape recording delivered to him filled with verbal abuse. She stalks him in a parking garage, pours acid on his car, and follows him home one night to spy on him, Beth, and Ellen from the bushes in their yard; the sight of their content family literally makes her sick to her stomach. Her obsession escalates further when Dan approaches the police to apply for a <a href="/wiki/Restraining_order" title="Restraining order">restraining order</a> against Alex (claiming that it is "for a client"). The lieutenant claims that he cannot violate her rights without <a href="/wiki/Probable_cause" title="Probable cause">probable cause</a>, and that the "client" has to own up to his <a href="/wiki/Adultery" title="Adultery">adultery</a>.
</p><p>At one point, while the Gallaghers are not home, Alex kills Ellen's pet rabbit, and puts it on their stove to boil. After this, Dan tells Beth of the affair and Alex's supposed pregnancy. Enraged, she demands that Dan leave. Before he goes, Dan calls Alex to tell her that Beth knows about the affair. Beth gets on the phone and warns Alex that she will kill her if she persists. Without Dan and Beth's knowledge, Alex picks up Ellen from school and takes her to an amusement park. Beth panics when she realizes that she does not know where Ellen is. She drives around frantically searching and rear-ends a car stopped at an intersection. Beth gets injured and is then hospitalized. Alex later takes Ellen home, asking her for a kiss on the cheek. Following Beth's release from the hospital, she forgives Dan and they return home.
</p><p>Dan barges into Alex's apartment and attacks her, choking her and coming close to strangling her. He stops himself, but as he does, she lunges at him with a kitchen knife. He overpowers her but decides to put the knife down and leave, while Alex is leaning against the kitchen counter, smiling. The police begin to search for her after Dan confronts them about having her arrested.
</p><p>Beth prepares a bath for herself when Alex suddenly appears, again with the kitchen knife. She starts to explain her resentment of Beth, nervously fidgeting (which causes Alex to cut her own leg) and then attacks Beth. Dan hears the screaming, rushes in, wrestles Alex into the bathtub, and seemingly drowns her. She suddenly emerges from the water, swinging the knife. Beth, who went searching for Dan's gun, shoots Alex in the chest, killing her. The final scene shows police cars outside the Gallaghers' house. As Dan finishes delivering his statement to the police, he walks inside, where Beth is waiting for him. They embrace and proceed to the living room as the camera focuses on a picture of them and Ellen.

He learns he is receiving the classic 1949 <a href="/wiki/Buick_Roadmaster" title="Buick Roadmaster">Buick Roadmaster</a> convertible which he and his father fought over, but the bulk of the $3 million estate is going to an unnamed <a href="/wiki/Trustee" title="Trustee">trustee</a>.

He has <a href="/wiki/Eidetic_memory" title="Eidetic memory">superb recall</a>, but he shows little emotional expression except when in distress. Charlie spirits Raymond out of the mental institution and into a hotel for the night. Susanna becomes upset with the way Charlie treats his brother and leaves. Charlie asks Raymond's doctor, Dr. Gerald R. Bruner, for half the estate in exchange for Raymond's return, but he refuses. Charlie decides to attempt to gain custody of his brother in order to get control of the money.
</p><p>After Raymond refuses to fly back to Los Angeles, they set out on a cross-country road trip together. During the course of the journey, Charlie learns more about Raymond, including that he is a <a href="/wiki/Mental_calculator" title="Mental calculator">mental calculator</a> with the ability to instantly count hundreds of objects at once, far beyond the normal range of human <a href="/wiki/Subitizing" title="Subitizing">subitizing</a> abilities. He also learns that Raymond actually lived with the family when Charlie was young and he realizes that the comforting figure from his childhood, whom he falsely remembered as an imaginary friend named "Rain Man", was actually Raymond.
</p><p>They make slow progress because Raymond insists on sticking to his routines, which include watching <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Wapner" title="Joseph Wapner">Judge Wapner</a> on television every day and getting to bed by 11:00 PM. He also objects to traveling on the <a href="/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System" title="Interstate Highway System">interstate</a> after they pass a bad accident.
</p><p>After the Lamborghinis are seized by his creditor, Charlie finds himself $80,000 in the hole and hatches a plan to return to <a href="/wiki/Las_Vegas_Strip" title="Las Vegas Strip">Las Vegas</a>, which they passed the night before, and win money at <a href="/wiki/Blackjack" title="Blackjack">blackjack</a> by <a href="/wiki/Card_counting" title="Card counting">counting cards</a>. Though the casino bosses are skeptical that anyone can count cards with a six deck <a href="/wiki/Shoe_(cards)" title="Shoe (cards)">shoe</a>, after reviewing security footage they ask Charlie and Raymond to leave. Charlie has made enough to cover his debts and has reconciled with Susanna who rejoined them in Las Vegas.
</p><p>Back in Los Angeles, Charlie meets with Dr. Bruner, who offers him $250,000 to walk away from Raymond. Charlie refuses and says that he is no longer upset about what his father left him, but he wants to have a relationship with his brother. At a meeting with a court-appointed psychiatrist Raymond is shown to be unable to decide for himself what he wants. Charlie stops the questioning and tells Raymond he is happy to have him as his brother.
</p><p>Charlie takes Raymond to the train station where he boards an <a href="/wiki/Amtrak" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> train with Dr. Bruner to return to the mental institution. Charlie promises Raymond that he will visit in two weeks.
</p><p>In 1912, thirteen-year-old <a href="/wiki/Indiana_Jones" title="Indiana Jones">Henry "Indiana" Jones, Jr</a> is horseback riding with his <a href="/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America" title="Boy Scouts of America">Boy Scout</a> troop at <a href="/wiki/Arches_National_Park" title="Arches National Park">Arches National Park</a> in <a href="/wiki/Utah" title="Utah">Utah</a>. While scouting caves, Indy discovers a group of grave robbers who have found a golden <a href="/wiki/Crucifix" title="Crucifix">crucifix</a> belonging to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Francisco_V%C3%A1squez_de_Coronado" title="Francisco Vásquez de Coronado">Coronado</a> and steals it from them, hoping to donate it to a museum. The men give chase through a passing <a href="/wiki/Circus_train" title="Circus train">circus train</a>, leaving Indy with a bloody cut across his chin from a <a href="/wiki/Bullwhip" title="Bullwhip">bullwhip</a> and a new <a href="/wiki/Ophidiophobia" title="Ophidiophobia">phobia of snakes</a>. Indy escapes, but the local sheriff makes him return the cross to the robbers, who immediately turn it over to a mysterious benefactor wearing a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Panama_Hat" title="Panama Hat">Panama Hat</a>. Impressed with Indy's bravery, the leader of the robbers gives Indy his <a href="/wiki/Fedora" title="Fedora">fedora</a>, and tells him that he may have lost this battle, but that he does not have to like it.
</p><p>In 1938, Indy battles "Panama Hat" and his henchmen on a ship off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Estado_Novo_(Portugal)" title="Estado Novo (Portugal)">Portugal</a>. A violent <a href="/wiki/Gale" title="Gale">gale</a> ensues, and Indy escapes overboard just before the ship explodes. He recovers the cross and donates it to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marcus_Brody" title="Marcus Brody">Marcus Brody</a>'s museum. Later, Indy is introduced to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Walter_Donovan" title="Walter Donovan">Walter Donovan</a>, who informs him that his father, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Jones,_Sr." title="Henry Jones, Sr.">Henry Jones, Sr.</a>, has vanished while searching for the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Grail" title="Holy Grail">Holy Grail</a>, using an incomplete inscription from a stone tablet as his guide. Indy receives Henry's Grail diary via mail from <a href="/wiki/Venice" title="Venice">Venice</a>. Realizing that he would not have sent the diary unless he was in trouble, Indy and Marcus travel to Venice, where they meet Henry's <a href="/wiki/Federal_State_of_Austria" title="Federal State of Austria">Austrian</a> colleague Dr. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Elsa_Schneider" title="Elsa Schneider">Elsa Schneider</a>. Beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indy and Elsa discover a set of half-flooded catacombs that house the tomb of a <a href="/wiki/First_Crusade" title="First Crusade">First Crusade</a> knight, which contains a complete version of the inscription that Henry had used, revealing the location of the Grail. They flee when the <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a>-saturated waters of the catacombs are set aflame by the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, a <a href="/wiki/Secret_society" title="Secret society">secret society</a> that protects the Grail from evildoers. Indy and Elsa capture one of the Brotherhood, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Indiana_Jones_series#Kazim" title="List of characters in the Indiana Jones series">Kazim</a>, who tells Indy where Henry is being held after Indy explains that his only goal is to find Henry, not the Grail. Marcus reveals a map drawn by Henry of the route to the Grail, which begins in Alexandretta. Indy removes the map from the diary, gives it to Marcus for safekeeping, and sends him to <a href="/wiki/%C4%B0skenderun" title="İskenderun">İskenderun</a>, the city built on the ruins of Alexandretta, to rendezvous with their old friend <a href="/wiki/Sallah" title="Sallah">Sallah</a>.
</p><p>Indy and Elsa head to a <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi</a>-controlled castle where Henry is being held. Indy finds Henry, but learns that both Elsa and Donovan are actually working with the Nazis and are using the Joneses to find the Grail for them. Meanwhile, Marcus is captured in <a href="/wiki/Hatay_State" title="Hatay State">Hatay</a>, while waiting with Sallah. After escaping from the castle, Henry tells Indy that the Grail is guarded by three <a href="/wiki/Booby_trap" title="Booby trap">booby traps</a> and his diary contains the clues needed to pass them safely. They recover the diary from Elsa at a <a href="/wiki/Nazi_book_burnings" title="Nazi book burnings">book burning</a> rally in <a href="/wiki/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, briefly coming face-to-face with <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Hitler</a>.

They crash while engaging in a <a href="/wiki/Dogfight" title="Dogfight">dogfight</a> with <a href="/wiki/Luftwaffe" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> fighters.
</p><p>The two meet up with Sallah in Hatay, where they learn of Marcus' abduction. The Nazis are already moving toward the Grail's location, using the map possessed by Marcus. In exchange for a <a href="/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Phantom_II" title="Rolls-Royce Phantom II">Rolls-Royce</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Sultan" title="Sultan">Sultan</a> of Hatay has given the Nazis full access to his equipment for the expedition, including a large tank. Indy, Henry, and Sallah find the Nazi expedition, which is ambushed by the Brotherhood. During the battle, Henry is captured by SS Colonel <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Indiana_Jones_series#Vogel" title="List of characters in the Indiana Jones series">Ernst Vogel</a> while attempting to rescue Marcus from the tank; Kazim and his comrades are killed. Indy pursues the tank on horseback and, with the aid of Sallah, saves Henry and Marcus. He is caught up in a fight with Vogel, and barely escapes before the tank goes over a cliff, sending Vogel to his death.
</p><p>Indy, Henry, Marcus, and Sallah catch up with the surviving Nazis, led by Donovan and Elsa, who have found the temple where the Holy Grail is kept but are unable to pass through the three protective booby traps. Donovan shoots and mortally wounds Henry in order to force Indy to risk his life in the traps to find the Grail and use its healing power to save him. Using the information in the diary and followed by Donovan and Elsa, Indy safely overcomes the traps and reaches the Grail's chamber, which is guarded by a knight. He has been kept alive for 700 years by the power of the Grail, which is hidden among dozens of false grails; only the true Grail brings life, while a false one claims it. Elsa purposefully selects a golden chalice studded with emeralds for Donovan, who ages into dust after drinking from it, proving it to be false. Indy selects a simple wooden cup, and the knight tells him that he has "chosen wisely," but warns that the Holy Grail cannot be taken beyond the temple's entrance. Indy fills the Grail with <a href="/wiki/Holy_water" title="Holy water">holy water</a> and gives it to Henry, healing him instantly. Disregarding the knight's warning, Elsa takes the Grail and attempts to leave with it. The temple begins to collapse and after the Grail drops into a chasm, Elsa falls to her death trying to recover it. Indy nearly suffers the same fate before Henry persuades him to leave it. The Joneses, Marcus, and Sallah escape the temple and ride off into the sunset.

</p><p>After leaving Willie's residence, Sam happens upon the parlor of <a href="/wiki/Psychic" title="Psychic">psychic</a> Oda Mae Brown, a <a href="/wiki/Charlatan" title="Charlatan">charlatan</a> pretending to <a href="/wiki/Mediumship" title="Mediumship">commune with spirits of the dead</a> who is shocked to discover her true psychic gift when she can hear Sam speaking. Sam persuades her to warn Molly that she is in danger. To allay Molly's skepticism, Oda Mae relays information that only Sam could know. Molly gives Willie's address to Carl; she then goes to the police, who have no file for Willie but they show her Oda Mae's lengthy one as a forger and con artist.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Sam follows Carl and is devastated to learn he and Willie are working together. Carl is <a href="/wiki/Money_laundering" title="Money laundering">laundering money</a> for drug dealers and he had Willie rob Sam to get his apartment key, which Carl uses to obtain Sam's book of passwords and transfer the money into a single account under the fictitious "Rita Miller".
</p><p>Sam learns from a violent <a href="/wiki/Poltergeist" title="Poltergeist">poltergeist</a> haunting the <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Subway" title="New York City Subway">subway system</a> how to manipulate objects with his mind. Sam then persuades Oda Mae to help him thwart Carl. Before Carl can transfer the money for his clients, Oda Mae impersonates Rita Miller, closes the account, and reluctantly gives the $4 million cashier's check to charity. As Carl desperately searches for the money, Sam reveals his presence by typing his name on the computer keyboard. Carl goes to Molly, who reveals she spotted Oda Mae closing an account at the bank. Carl and Willie go to Oda Mae's place but Sam warns her and her sisters to take shelter. When Willie arrives, Sam tosses objects at him, who flees into the street in a fit of panic and is killed by an oncoming car. Shadowy creatures emerge from the darkness to drag Willie's ghost down to <a href="/wiki/Hell" title="Hell">Hell</a>.
</p><p>Sam and Oda Mae return to the apartment where—by levitating a penny into Molly's hand—he convinces Molly that Oda Mae is telling the truth about him. Oda Mae allows Sam to <a href="/wiki/Spirit_possession" title="Spirit possession">possess her body</a> so he and Molly can share a slow dance. Carl breaks into the apartment but Sam is too exhausted from the possession to fight Carl. The women run onto the fire escape, to a loft under construction, but Carl catches Oda Mae and holds her at gunpoint, demanding the check. A recovered Sam pushes Carl off her so Carl takes Molly hostage, pleading with Sam for the check. Sam disarms Carl and attacks him again. Carl tries to escape through a window and tosses a suspended hook at Sam, but the hook swings back, shatters the window and it slides down, fatally impaling and killing Carl with a glass shard. The shadowy creatures return to claim Carl's ghost for Hell.
</p><p>Sam asks if the women are all right. Miraculously, Molly can now hear him. A heavenly light shines in the room, illuminating Sam's presence. Realizing that it is time for him to go with his task now completed, he and Molly share a tearful goodbye and one final kiss. Sam thanks Oda Mae for her help and then walks into the light and onward to <a href="/wiki/Heaven" title="Heaven">Heaven</a>.

In 2029, Skynet sends a new <a href="/wiki/Terminator_(character_concept)" title="Terminator (character concept)">Terminator</a>, designated as <a href="/wiki/T-1000" title="T-1000">T-1000</a>, back in time to kill John. The T-1000 is an advanced prototype made out of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mimetic" title="Mimetic">mimetic</a> poly-alloy (referred to as "liquid metal") that gives it the ability to take on the shape and appearance of almost anything it touches, and to transform its arms into blades and other shapes at will. The T-1000 arrives under a freeway, kills a policeman and assumes his identity. Meanwhile, the future John Connor has sent back a reprogrammed <a href="/wiki/Terminator_(character)" title="Terminator (character)">T-800 (Model 101) Terminator</a> to protect his young self.
</p><p>The Terminator and the T-1000 converge on John in a shopping mall, and a chase ensues after which John and the Terminator escape together on a motorcycle. Fearing that the T-1000 will kill Sarah in order to get to him, John orders the Terminator to help free her, after discovering that the Terminator must follow his orders. They encounter Sarah as she is escaping from the hospital, although she is initially reluctant to trust the T-800. After the trio escapes from the T-1000 in a police car, the Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet's history. In addition, it would create machines that will hunt and kill the remnants of humanity.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[a]</a></sup> Sarah learns that the man most directly responsible for Skynet's creation is Miles Bennett Dyson, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cyberdyne_Systems" title="Cyberdyne Systems">Cyberdyne Systems</a> engineer working on a revolutionary new <a href="/wiki/Artificial_neural_network" title="Artificial neural network">neural net</a> processor that will form the basis for Skynet.
</p><p>Sarah gathers weapons from an old friend and plans to flee with John to Mexico, but after having a nightmare about Judgment Day, she instead sets out to kill Dyson in order to prevent Judgment Day from occurring. Finding him at his home, she wounds him but finds herself unable to kill him in front of his family. John and the Terminator arrive and inform Dyson of the future consequences of his work. They learn that much of his research has been <a href="/wiki/Reverse_engineering" title="Reverse engineering">reverse engineered</a> from the damaged CPU and the right arm of the previous Terminator who attacked Sarah back in 1984. Convincing him that these items and his designs must be destroyed, they break into the Cyberdyne building, retrieve the CPU and the arm, and set explosives to destroy Dyson's lab. The police arrive and Dyson is fatally shot, but he rigs an improvised <a href="/wiki/Dead_man%27s_switch" title="Dead man's switch">dead man's switch</a> that detonates the explosives when he dies. The T-1000 relentlessly pursues the surviving trio, eventually cornering them in a steel mill.
</p><p>The T-1000 and the T-800 engage in physical combat and the more advanced model seriously damages and shuts down the T-800. However, unbeknownst to the T-1000, the T-800 brings itself back online using emergency power. The T-1000 nearly kills John and Sarah but the T-800 takes it by surprise and blasts it into a vat of molten steel with an <a href="/wiki/M79_grenade_launcher" title="M79 grenade launcher">M79 grenade launcher</a>, destroying it. John tosses the arm and CPU of the original Terminator into the vat as well. As Sarah expresses relief that the ordeal is over, the Terminator explains that to ensure that it is not used for reverse engineering it must also be destroyed. It asks Sarah to assist in lowering it into the vat of molten steel, since it is unable to "self-terminate". Although John begs the Terminator to reconsider, it bids them farewell and hugs a tearful John before it is lowered into the vat, giving a final thumbs-up as it disappears into the molten steel. John and Sarah drive down a highway and  Sarah says in a voice over, “The unknown future rolls toward us. I face it for the first time with a sense of hope. Because if a machine, a Terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too."

Aladdin and Jasmine become friends and eventually fall in love. When the palace guards capture Aladdin on Jafar's orders, Jasmine confronts Jafar to demand Aladdin's release, only for Jafar to lie to her that Aladdin has been executed.
</p><p>Disguised as an old man, Jafar frees Aladdin and Abu from prison, and sends them to the cave, ordering them to retrieve the lamp. There, Aladdin finds a <a href="/wiki/Magic_carpet" title="Magic carpet">magic carpet</a> and obtains the lamp. Unaware to touch nothing but the lamp, Abu grabs a red jewel, and the cave collapses. Aladdin hands over the lamp to Jafar, who throws both Aladdin and Abu back down into the cave, though not before Abu manages to steal the lamp back. Trapped, Aladdin rubs the lamp and meets the <a href="/wiki/Genie_(Disney)" title="Genie (Disney)">Genie</a>, who lives inside of it. The Genie tells Aladdin that he will grant him three wishes. Aladdin tricks the Genie into freeing themselves from the cave without using a wish, and he uses his first to become "Prince Ali Ababwa" in order to woo Jasmine.
</p><p>At Iago's suggestion, Jafar plots to become Sultan by marrying Jasmine. When Aladdin greets Jafar and the Sultan at the palace, Jasmine becomes angry at them. Refusing to tell Jasmine the truth, Aladdin takes Jasmine on a flight on the magic carpet. When she deduces his identity, he convinces her that he dresses as a <a href="/wiki/Peasant" title="Peasant">peasant</a> to escape the stresses of royal life. After sending Jasmine home, Aladdin is tied up, gagged and thrown into the sea by Jafar, but he is rescued from drowning by the Genie with his second wish. Jafar tries to hypnotize the Sultan into agreeing to his marriage to Jasmine, but Aladdin intervenes, exposing his evil plot in the process; however, Jafar spots the lamp and thus discovers Aladdin's true identity. He flees to his lair, and orders Iago to retrieve the lamp from Aladdin.
</p><p>Fearing that he will lose Jasmine if the truth is revealed, Aladdin refuses to free the Genie in order to maintain his charade. Iago steals the lamp, and Jafar becomes the Genie's new master. He uses his first two wishes to usurp the Sultan, and become the world's most powerful sorcerer, exposing Aladdin's identity and exiling him, Abu, and the carpet to a frozen wasteland. However, they escape, and return to the palace, where Jafar tries to use his final wish to make Jasmine fall in love with him, but the Genie cannot grant the wish as it is beyond his power. Upon noticing Aladdin, Jasmine pretends the wish has been granted to distract Jafar, and Aladdin attempts to retrieve the lamp. Jafar notices Aladdin, traps Jasmine inside an <a href="/wiki/Hourglass" title="Hourglass">hourglass</a>, and overpowers Aladdin and his friends with his magic. After Aladdin rescues Jasmine out of the hourglass, he tricks Jafar into using his last wish to become an all-powerful genie; now bound to his new lamp, Jafar ends up trapped inside it, taking Iago with him.
</p><p>With the palace and kingdom returned to normal, the Genie transports Jafar's lamp to the Cave of Wonders, and advises Aladdin use his third wish to regain his royal title so the law will allow him to stay with Jasmine. Realizing that he has to be himself, Aladdin decides to keep his promise and frees the Genie. Realizing Aladdin and Jasmine's love, the Sultan changes the law to allow Jasmine to marry whom she chooses. The Genie leaves to explore the world, while Aladdin and Jasmine start their new life together.
</p><p>Industrialist John Hammond and his <a href="/wiki/Biological_engineering" title="Biological engineering">bioengineering</a> company, InGen, have created a <a href="/wiki/Animal_theme_park" title="Animal theme park">theme park</a> featuring cloned dinosaurs and prehistoric plants, called Jurassic Park, on <a href="/wiki/Isla_Nublar" title="Isla Nublar">Isla Nublar</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rican</a> island. After a dinosaur handler is killed by a <i><a href="/wiki/Velociraptor" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a></i>, the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro, demand that experts visit the park and certify it is safe. To perform the inspection, Gennaro invites <a href="/wiki/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chaos_theory" title="Chaos theory">chaos theorist</a> Ian Malcolm, while Hammond invites <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paleontologist" title="Paleontologist">paleontologist</a> Dr. Alan Grant and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paleobotanist" title="Paleobotanist">paleobotanist</a> Dr. Ellie Sattler. Upon arrival, the group is shocked to see a live <i><a href="/wiki/Brachiosaurus" title="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a></i>, in addition to two more with a herd of <i><a href="/wiki/Parasaurolophus" title="Parasaurolophus">Parasaurolophus</a></i>.
</p><p>At the park's visitor center, the group learns the cloning was accomplished by extracting <a href="/wiki/Ancient_DNA" title="Ancient DNA">dinosaur DNA</a> from <a href="/wiki/Mosquito" title="Mosquito">mosquitoes</a> preserved in <a href="/wiki/Amber" title="Amber">amber</a>. DNA from <a href="/wiki/Frog" title="Frog">frogs</a> was used to fill in gaps in the dinosaurs' <a href="/wiki/Genome" title="Genome">genome</a>. To prevent breeding, all the dinosaurs were made female. Malcolm scoffs at the idea, saying it will inevitably break down. The group witnesses the hatching of a baby <i><a href="/wiki/Velociraptor" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a></i> and visits the raptor enclosure. At lunch, the group debates the <a href="/wiki/Ethics_of_cloning" title="Ethics of cloning">ethics of cloning</a> and the creation of the park. Malcolm gives a harsh warning about the implications of <a href="/wiki/Genetic_engineering" title="Genetic engineering">genetic engineering</a>.
</p><p>The group is joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Tim and Lex, for a tour of the park, while Hammond oversees the tour from the park's control room. The tour does not go as planned. Most of the dinosaurs fail to appear and the group encounters a sick <i><a href="/wiki/Triceratops" title="Triceratops">Triceratops</a></i>. It is cut short as a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" title="Tropical cyclone">tropical storm</a> approaches Isla Nublar. Most park employees leave for the mainland on a boat, while the visitors return to their electric tour vehicles. Sattler stays behind with the park's veterinarian to study the <i>Triceratops</i>.
</p><p>Jurassic Park's lead computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, has been bribed by Dodgson, a man working for Hammond's corporate rival, to steal fertilized dinosaur <a href="/wiki/Embryo" title="Embryo">embryos</a>. Nedry deactivates the park's security system to gain access to the embryo storage room and puts the stolen embryos inside a canister disguised as a shaving cream bottle. The power goes out, stalling the tour vehicles. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated, allowing the <i><a href="/wiki/Tyrannosaurus" title="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></i> to escape and attack the group. Grant and Hammond's grandchildren survive. The <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro. While taking the embryos to the island's dock, Nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes his <a href="/wiki/Jeep_Wrangler" title="Jeep Wrangler">Jeep Wrangler</a>, and is killed by a <i><a href="/wiki/Dilophosaurus" title="Dilophosaurus">Dilophosaurus</a></i>.
</p><p>Sattler helps the park's game warden, Robert Muldoon, search for survivors. They find only Malcolm before the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> returns. Grant, Tim, and Lex take shelter in a treetop. They later discover broken dinosaur egg shells. Grant concludes the dinosaurs have been breeding. This occurred because their frog DNA—<a href="/wiki/African_bullfrog" title="African bullfrog">West African bullfrogs</a> can change their sex in a single-sex environment, allowing the dinosaurs to do so as well, proving Malcolm right.
</p><p>Unable to decipher Nedry's code to reactivate the security system, Hammond and the park's chief engineer Ray Arnold reboot the park's system. The group shuts down the park's grid and retreats to an emergency bunker, while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When Arnold fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head to the shed. They discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining fences and released the <i>Velociraptors</i>. Muldoon distracts the raptors, while Sattler goes to turn the power back on, before being attacked by a raptor and discovering Arnold's severed arm. Muldoon is caught off guard and killed by the other two raptors.
</p><p>After encountering a <i><a href="/wiki/Brachiosaurus" title="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a></i> and narrowly escaping the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> during a <i><a href="/wiki/Gallimimus" title="Gallimimus">Gallimimus</a></i> stampede, Grant, Tim, and Lex reach the visitor center. Grant heads out to look for Sattler, leaving Tim (who was injured while scaling one of the fences) and Lex inside. They are pursued by the raptors in an industrial kitchen but escape and join Grant and Sattler. Lex restores full power from the control room, allowing them to call Hammond, who in turn calls for help. Grant, Tim, Lex, and Sattler are cornered by the raptors, but they escape when the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> suddenly appears and kills the raptors. Hammond arrives in a jeep with Malcolm, and the survivors board a helicopter to leave the island.
</p><p>In the Pride Lands of <a href="/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>, a pride of lions rule over the animal kingdom from Pride Rock. King Mufasa's and Queen Sarabi's newborn son, <a href="/wiki/Simba" title="Simba">Simba</a> (whose name is <a href="/wiki/Swahili_language" title="Swahili language">Swahili</a> for lion<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>), is presented to the gathering animals by Rafiki the baboon (with the colorful facial marking of a <a href="/wiki/Mandrill" title="Mandrill">mandrill</a>)<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-grasset_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-grasset-5">[5]</a></sup> who serves as the <a href="/wiki/Shamanism" title="Shamanism">shaman</a> and advisor. Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the "circle of life", which connects all living things. Mufasa's younger brother, <a href="/wiki/Scar_(The_Lion_King)" title="Scar (The Lion King)">Scar</a>, covets the throne and plots to eliminate both Mufasa and Simba, so he may become king. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala—to whom Simba is betrothed—into exploring a forbidden <a href="/wiki/Elephants%27_graveyard" title="Elephants' graveyard">elephants' graveyard</a>, where they are attacked by three <a href="/wiki/Spotted_hyena" title="Spotted hyena">spotted hyenas</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_characters_in_The_Lion_King#Shenzi,_Banzai_and_Ed" title="List of characters in The Lion King">Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed</a>, who are in league with Scar. Mufasa is alerted about the incident by his <a href="/wiki/Majordomo" title="Majordomo">majordomo</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Hornbill" title="Hornbill">hornbill</a> Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though upset with Simba, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba.
</p><p>Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of <a href="/wiki/Wildebeest" title="Wildebeest">wildebeest</a> into a stampede that will trample him. He informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing that king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge. Scar refuses to help Mufasa, instead sending him falling to his death. He then convinces Simba that the tragedy was Simba's own fault and advises him to leave the kingdom. He then orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing his three hyena minions and the rest of their large pack to live in the Pride Lands.
</p><p>Simba collapses in a desert and is rescued by <a href="/wiki/Timon_and_Pumbaa" title="Timon and Pumbaa">Timon and Pumbaa</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Meerkat" title="Meerkat">meerkat</a> and <a href="/wiki/Common_warthog" title="Common warthog">warthog</a>, who are fellow outcasts. Simba grows up in the jungle with his two new friends, living a carefree life under the motto "<a href="/wiki/Hakuna_matata" title="Hakuna matata">hakuna matata</a>" ("no worries" in <a href="/wiki/Swahili_language" title="Swahili language">Swahili</a>). Now a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reunite and fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a drought-stricken wasteland under Scar's reign. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as king. Realizing that he can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.
</p><p>Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who had just struck Sarabi. Scar taunts Simba over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to him that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame the hyenas for his actions; Simba spares his life, but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to toss him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. Afterwards, Simba takes over the kingship as rain begins to fall.
</p><p>Later, with Pride Rock restored to its usual state, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of life.
</p><p>In a world where toys are living things but pretend to be lifeless when humans are present, a group of toys, owned by a boy named Andy Davis, are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as his family (including his mother and infant sister Molly) is preparing to move the following week. Andy's toys – including Bo Peep the shepherdess, Mr. Potato Head, Rex the dinosaur, Hamm the piggy bank and Slinky Dog – fear they will be replaced by new toys from the birthday. A pull-string cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody – the toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy – sends out <a href="/wiki/Army_men" title="Army men">army men</a>, led by Sergeant, to spy on the party and report the gift results to the others via <a href="/wiki/Baby_monitor" title="Baby monitor">baby monitors</a>. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them being replaced by new toys, but then Andy receives a surprise gift – a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who thinks he is a real space ranger.
</p><p>Buzz impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, making Woody feel abandoned. As Andy prepares for a family outing at Pizza Planet, his mother allows him to bring one toy. Fearing Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap him behind a desk, but ends up accidentally knocking him out of a window. The other toys, except Bo Peep and Slinky, rebel against Woody, believing he did harm to Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, Andy takes Woody and leaves for Pizza Planet. When the family stops for gas, Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on their van. They have a fight, only to find the family has left without them. They manage to make their way to the restaurant by stowing away on a pizza delivery truck. Buzz, still thinking he is a real space ranger, despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a crane game, where they are won by Andy's toy-abusing neighbor, a boy named Sid Phillips.
</p><p>Woody attempts to escape from Sid's house, but Buzz, finally realizing he is a toy after watching a Buzz Lightyear TV ad and trying and failing to fly out a window, sinks into despondency. Sid plans to launch Buzz on a fireworks rocket, but his plans are delayed by a thunderstorm. Woody tells Buzz about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy, restoring his confidence. The next day, Woody and Sid's mutant creature toys rescue Buzz just as Sid is about to launch the rocket and scare Sid into no longer abusing toys, and he runs into his house screaming in horror. Woody and Buzz leave just as Andy and his family drive away toward their new home.
</p><p>The duo tries to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog, Scud, sees them and gives chase. Buzz gets left behind while saving Woody from Scud, and Woody tries rescuing him with Andy's radio-controlled car (RC). Thinking that Woody is trying to eliminate RC as well, the other toys attack and toss him off the truck. Having evaded Scud, Buzz and RC retrieve Woody and continue to chase the truck. Upon seeing Woody and Buzz together on RC, the other toys realize their mistake and try to help them get back aboard, but RC's batteries become depleted, stranding them. Woody ignites the rocket on Buzz's back and manages to throw RC into the truck before they soar into the air. Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket before it explodes, gliding with Woody to land safely into a box in the van, right next to Andy.
</p><p>On Christmas Day, at their new house, Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals. One of the toys is Mrs. Potato Head, much to Mr. Potato Head's delight. As Woody jokingly asks what might be worse than Buzz, they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Bonwit_Teller" title="Bonwit Teller">Bonwit Teller</a> department store is destroyed by a bomb during the morning commute. The <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department" title="New York City Police Department">New York City Police Department</a> gets a call from "Simon", the terrorist, ordering that suspended police officer Lt. <a href="/wiki/John_McClane" title="John McClane">John McClane</a> be dropped in <a href="/wiki/Harlem" title="Harlem">Harlem</a> wearing only his underwear and a <a href="/wiki/Sandwich_board" title="Sandwich board">sandwich board</a> with "I Hate Niggers" written on it, and threatening to detonate another bomb if they do not comply. After locating a hung-over McClane, the NYPD complies. McClane is saved from an angry group of black men by Zeus Carver, a nearby locksmith and shop owner, and they take a cab to NYPD headquarters. While at headquarters, the NYPD is briefed by explosives expert Charlie, who introduces them to the binary liquids Simon is using to create his powerful explosives, and they learn that four thousand pounds had been recently stolen. Simon calls again and demands that both McClane and Carver follow his continuing instructions.
</p><p>Simon sends the two on a series of children's riddles, which ultimately require them to reach the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wall_Street_(IRT_Broadway_%E2%80%93_Seventh_Avenue_Line)" title="Wall Street (IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line)">Wall Street subway station</a> 90 blocks south within 30 minutes to stop a bomb planted on a Brooklyn-bound <a href="/wiki/3_(New_York_City_Subway_service)" title="3 (New York City Subway service)">3 train</a>. McClane boards the subway while Carver drives to the stop. Though Carver answers Simon's call and McClane locates the bomb, Simon detonates it immediately after McClane throws it off the train in the station, derailing the train and damaging the subway station. As McClane and Carver regroup with the police, they are met by <a href="/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</a> agents, who reveal Simon is "Peter Krieg", a former Colonel in the East German <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volksarmee" title="Volksarmee">People's Army</a> and a mercenary-for-hire. However, Krieg's real name is Simon Peter Gruber, the brother of Hans Gruber -- whom McClane had killed <a href="/wiki/Die_Hard" title="Die Hard">years earlier in Los Angeles</a>. 
</p><p>Simon then calls the police, knowing the FBI is there, to inform them that he has placed a bomb in a NYC public school that is rigged with a radio detonator triggered by the use of the FBI and police bands. Simon tells them that he will give McClane and Carver the school's location if they continue to play his game. While McClane and Carver set off on Simon's next task, the police organize all NYC's public works to search schools, using <a href="/wiki/9-1-1" title="9-1-1">9-1-1</a> to coordinate activities. As McClane and Carver solves Simon's riddles, McClane realizes that Simon is using the school bomb as a distraction to draw the police away from the bomb damage at Wall Street. They return there to find that Simon and his team used fake repair crews to dig into the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York" title="Federal Reserve Bank of New York">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a> and steal $140 billion of <a href="/wiki/Precious_metal#Bullion" title="Precious metal">gold bullion</a> in dump trucks. They follow the trucks to an <a href="/wiki/Aqueduct_(water_supply)" title="Aqueduct (water supply)">aqueduct</a> in the <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Water_Tunnel_No._3" title="New York City Water Tunnel No. 3">New York City Water Tunnel No. 3</a>. McClane then follows the trucks, while Carver continues with Simon's games. 
</p><p>Within the tunnel McClane kills some of Simon's men, discovering they have a pre-wrapped roll of quarters on them. Simon destroys a <a href="/wiki/Cofferdam" title="Cofferdam">cofferdam</a>, flooding the tunnel, but McClane escapes through a vent, ending up near Carver. After surviving a car chase with Simon's men who had followed Carver and finding that they also had a pre-wrapped roll of quarters, they realize that the roll of quarters would pay for a toll bridge, and they head to a tanker vessel in the <a href="/wiki/Long_Island_Sound" title="Long Island Sound">Long Island Sound</a>. They sneak aboard, learning that the bullion isn't there, but are both captured. 
</p><p>Simon confirms McClane's suspicions that the school bomb (which had been found using the clues provided by Simon, but turned out to be a dummy) was a trick to distract police before handcuffing the two to the real bomb. He says he is going to destroy the tanker, redistributing the bullion across the Sound, to destroy the economies of the world. Before Simon leaves, McClane jokingly asks him for some aspirin for his hangover, much to Simon's amusement. He happens to have a bottle of aspirin and tosses it to McClane. After Simon leaves, McClane passes a cable splinter to Carver, who picks the handcuffs to free them. They barely escape before the bomb detonates, sinking the tanker.
</p><p>As McClane and Carver are debriefed by the police, McClane reports that none of the bullion was on the tanker. McClane notices the bottle of aspirin came from a truckstop located in <a href="/wiki/Quebec" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> at the Canada-US border. McClane, Carver, and the police arrive at a warehouse near the truckstop where Simon and his men are in the process of distributing the bullion and planning their escape. The rest of Simon's men are captured, while Simon and his girlfriend Katya attempt to escape in a helicopter, stopping to fire upon McClane and Carver. McClane, armed only with a small revolver, shoots an overhead power line that falls onto the helicopter, crashing it and killing Simon and Katya. Carver then convinces McClane to call his estranged wife, <a href="/wiki/John_McClane#Family" title="John McClane">Holly</a>.
</p><p>On July 2, 1996, an enormous <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mothership" title="Mothership">mothership</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/UFO" title="UFO">UFO</a>, that has one fourth the mass of the Moon, enters orbit around Earth, deploying assault fortress saucers, each fifteen miles wide, that take positions over some of Earth's major cities. David Levinson, an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MIT" title="MIT">MIT</a>-trained satellite technician, decodes a signal embedded within global satellite transmissions that he determines is the aliens' countdown timer for a coordinated attack. With help from his former wife, <a href="/wiki/White_House_Communications_Director" title="White House Communications Director">White House Communications Director</a> Constance Spano, David, and his father Julius, gain access to the <a href="/wiki/Oval_Office" title="Oval Office">Oval Office</a> and warn <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">President</a> Thomas J. Whitmore the aliens are hostile. Whitmore immediately orders large-scale evacuations of <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, but it is too late; the timer reaches zero and the saucers activate devastating <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Directed-energy_weapons" title="Directed-energy weapons">directed-energy weapons</a>, killing millions. Whitmore, the Levinsons, and a few others narrowly escape aboard <a href="/wiki/Air_Force_One" title="Air Force One">Air Force One</a> as the capital is destroyed, along with the other locations over which the saucers are positioned.
</p><p>On July 3, international leaders begin ordering individual counterattacks. Their <a href="/wiki/Military_aviation" title="Military aviation">air forces</a> attack the saucers positioned above the ruins of the cities, but the saucers are protected by <a href="/wiki/Force_field_(fiction)" title="Force field (fiction)">force fields</a>. Each saucer launches a swarm of attack fighters, each with its own shield as well, which wipes out the human fighter squadrons and military bases. Captain Steven Hiller, a F/A-18 jet pilot with the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps" title="United States Marine Corps">USMC</a> squadron <a href="/wiki/VMFA-314" title="VMFA-314">VMFA-314</a> based out of <a href="/wiki/Marine_Corps_Air_Station_El_Toro" title="Marine Corps Air Station El Toro">Marine Corps Air Station El Toro</a>, survives by luring his attacker to the enclosed spaces of the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Canyon" title="Grand Canyon">Grand Canyon</a> and sacrificing his plane, forcing the alien to crash-land. He subdues the injured alien pilot and flags down a convoy of refugees, hitching a ride with former combat pilot Russell Casse. They transport the unconscious alien to <a href="/wiki/Area_51" title="Area 51">Area 51</a>, where Whitmore's group has landed. Through <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secretary_of_Defense" title="United States Secretary of Defense">Secretary of Defense</a> Albert Nimzicki, they learn that a faction of the government has been involved in a <a href="/wiki/UFO_conspiracy_theory" title="UFO conspiracy theory">UFO conspiracy</a> since 1947, when one of the invaders' attack fighters crashed in <a href="/wiki/Roswell_UFO_incident" title="Roswell UFO incident">Roswell</a>. Area 51 houses the refurbished alien fighter, and three alien corpses recovered from the crash.
</p><p>When eccentric scientist Dr. Brackish Okun examines the alien captured by Steven, it regains consciousness and attacks. It <a href="/wiki/Telepathy" title="Telepathy">telepathically</a> invades Dr. Okun's mind and uses his vocal cords to communicate with President Whitmore before launching a psychic attack against him. Whitmore sees visions of the aliens' plans: their entire civilization travels from planet to planet, exterminating all indigenous life and stripping the planet of all natural resources. After <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service" title="United States Secret Service">Secret Service</a> agents and military personnel kill the alien which leaves Dr. Okun in a coma, Whitmore reluctantly authorizes a nuclear attack; a <a href="/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit" title="Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit">B-2 Spirit</a> fires a nuclear warhead tipped cruise missile at a saucer positioned above <a href="/wiki/Houston" title="Houston">Houston</a>, but the saucer remains intact, whilst wiping out the city.
</p><p>On <a href="/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)" title="Independence Day (United States)">July 4</a>, David demonstrates the key to defeating the aliens is to deactivate their force fields, and devises a plan to do this by uploading a <a href="/wiki/Computer_virus" title="Computer virus">computer virus</a> into the mothership using the refurbished alien fighter, which Steven volunteers to pilot. With military pilots in short supply, Whitmore enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience, including Russell, to fly the remaining F/A-18s at Area 51; and leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on the base. Flying into space, Steven and David upload the virus and successfully deploy a nuclear weapon on board the mothership, blowing it to pieces. With the aliens' shields deactivated, the fighter jets are able to effectively fight back against the enemy craft, but their supply of missiles is exhausted before they can bring down the ship. As the saucer prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile to spare, but when the firing control on the missile fails, he bravely <a href="/wiki/Kamikaze" title="Kamikaze">rams</a> his jet into the directed-energy weapon port, causing a chain reaction that destroys the entire ship. Human resistance forces around the world are informed of the alien ships' weak point, and successfully destroy the other saucers. As humankind is rejoicing in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families. They then accompany Whitmore and his daughter in watching the wreckage from the mothership burn up, resembling a <a href="/wiki/Fireworks" title="Fireworks">fireworks</a> display as it enters Earth's atmosphere.
</p><p>In 1996, treasure hunter Brock Lovett and his team aboard the research vessel <i><a href="/wiki/Akademik_Mstislav_Keldysh" title="Akademik Mstislav Keldysh">Akademik Mstislav Keldysh</a></i> search the wreck of RMS <i>Titanic</i> for a necklace with a rare diamond, the <a href="/wiki/Heart_of_the_Ocean" title="Heart of the Ocean">Heart of the Ocean</a>. They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[Note 1]</a></sup> Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard <i>Keldysh</i> and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard <i>Titanic</i>.
</p><p>In 1912 <a href="/wiki/Southampton" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>, 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fiancé Cal Hockley, and her mother Ruth board the luxurious <i>Titanic</i>. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve their family's financial problems and retain their high-class persona. Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class.
</p><p>Aware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cal's bodyguard, Mr. Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with an iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.
</p><p>Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Lovejoy slips the necklace into Jack's pocket and he and Cal accuse him of theft. Jack is arrested, taken to the <a href="/wiki/Master-at-arms" title="Master-at-arms">master-at-arms</a>' office, and handcuffed to a pipe. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.
</p><p>With the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.
</p><p>After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for only one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of <a href="/wiki/Hypothermia" title="Hypothermia">hypothermia</a><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Carlson_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Carlson-9">[8]</a></sup> but Rose is saved.
</p><p>With Rose hiding from Cal en route, the <a href="/wiki/RMS_Carpathia" title="RMS Carpathia">RMS <i>Carpathia</i></a> takes the survivors to New York City where Rose gives her name as Rose Dawson. Rose says she later read that Cal committed suicide after losing all his money in the <a href="/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929" title="Wall Street Crash of 1929">Wall Street Crash of 1929</a>.
</p><p>Back in the present, Lovett decides to abandon his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of <i>Keldysh</i>, Rose takes out the Heart of the Ocean – in her possession all along – and drops it into the sea over the wreck site.

NASA scientists, led by Dan Truman, plan to trigger a thermonuclear detonation at least 800 ft (244 m) inside the asteroid to split it in two, driving the pieces apart so both will fly past the Earth. NASA contacts Harry Stamper, considered the best deep-sea oil driller in the world, for assistance. Harry insists he will need his full team, consisting of A.J. Frost, Rockhound, Max Lennert, Charles "Chick" Chapel, Bear, Freddie Noonan and Oscar Choi, to help execute NASA's plan, and they agree to help.
</p><p>NASA plans to launch two specialized <a href="/wiki/Space_Shuttle_orbiter" title="Space Shuttle orbiter">Space Shuttle orbiters</a>, the X-71s, <i>Freedom</i> and <i>Independence</i>, to increase the chances of success; the shuttles will refill with <a href="/wiki/Liquid_oxygen" title="Liquid oxygen">liquid oxygen</a> from the Russian space station <i><a href="/wiki/Mir" title="Mir">Mir</a></i>  before making a <a href="/wiki/Gravity_assist" title="Gravity assist">slingshot maneuver</a> around the Moon to approach the asteroid from behind. NASA puts Harry and his crew through a shortened and rigorous astronaut training program, while Harry's team re-outfit the mobile drillers, "Armadillos", for the job. During training, Truman and Harry are skeptical about the abilities of A.J., who has been dating Harry's daughter Grace against Harry's wishes.
</p><p>When a meteorite destroys <a href="/wiki/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, the government is forced to reveal the asteroid's existence and their plan. The shuttles are launched and arrive at the space station, where its sole cosmonaut Lev Andropov helps with refueling. A major fire breaks out during the fueling process, forcing the crews, including Lev, to evacuate in the shuttles before the station explodes. The shuttles perform the slingshot around the Moon, but approaching the asteroid, <i>Independence</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s engines are destroyed by trailing debris, and it crash-lands on the asteroid, killing Noonan, Oscar, munitions specialist Lieutenant Halsey, and shuttle pilots colonel Davis and Tucker. Grace, aware A.J. was aboard <i>Independence</i>, is traumatized by this news, believing he was killed. Unknown to the others, A.J., Lev and Bear survive the impact and head towards <i>Freedom</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s landing site in their Armadillo.
</p><p><i>Freedom</i> manages to land on the asteroid, but overshoots their target zone, landing on a much harder metallic field. With their drilling falling behind NASA's calculated schedule, the military initiates "secondary protocol", a backup plan to remotely detonate the bomb at the asteroid's surface, despite Truman and Harry's insistence that it would be ineffective. Truman delays the military, while Harry persuades the shuttle commander, Colonel Willie Sharp, to disarm the remote trigger. The crew continues to work, but in their haste, they accidentally hit a gas pocket, blowing their Armadillo into space with Lennert inside. As the world learns of the mission's apparent failure, another meteorite decimates <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>.
</p><p>All seems lost until <i>Independence</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s Armadillo arrives. With A.J. at the controls, they reach the required depth for the bomb. However, flying debris from the asteroid kills lieutenant Gruber and damages the bomb timer, requiring someone to stay behind to manually detonate it. The crew <a href="/wiki/Drawing_straws" title="Drawing straws">draw straws</a> and A.J. is selected. As he and Harry exit the airlock, Harry rips off A.J.'s air hose and shoves him back inside, telling him he is the son Harry never had and gives his blessing to marry Grace. Harry contacts Grace to bid her farewell. After some last minute difficulties involving both the shuttle engines and the detonator, <i>Freedom</i> moves to a safe distance and Harry successfully triggers the detonator while his life flashes before his eyes. The bomb successfully splits the asteroid, avoiding the collision with Earth. <i>Freedom</i> safely returns to Earth, and the surviving crew is treated as heroes. A.J. and Grace get married, with photos of Harry and the other lost crew members present.

</p><p>Bio-chemical expert Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich sends a message to the <a href="/wiki/Impossible_Missions_Force" title="Impossible Missions Force">IMF</a> for <a href="/wiki/Ethan_Hunt" title="Ethan Hunt">Ethan Hunt</a>, an old friend of his, warning that his employer, Biocyte Pharmaceuticals, forced him to develop a biological epidemic to profit from its remedy. He arranges to meet with Ethan to deliver the <a href="/wiki/Chimera_(virus)" title="Chimera (virus)">Chimera</a> virus, and its cure, <a href="/wiki/Bellerophon" title="Bellerophon">Bellerophon</a>. With Ethan on vacation and incommunicado, the IMF sends agent Sean Ambrose disguised as Ethan to meet Nekhorvich on a passenger plane. Ambrose goes rogue, killing Nekhorvich and stealing Bellerophon before his men destroy the plane.
</p><p>IMF Commander Swanbeck informs Ethan of the circumstances of Nekhorvich's death and they determine Ambrose is responsible. Swanbeck tasks Ethan with recovering the virus and its cure, and has him recruit Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a professional thief presently operating in <a href="/wiki/Seville" title="Seville">Seville</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>. After recruiting Nyah and romancing her, Ethan finds out that she is Ambrose's ex-girlfriend and he reluctantly convinces her to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spy" title="Spy">spy</a> on Ambrose.
</p><p>Ethan assembles his team, computer expert Luther Stickell and pilot Billy Baird, in <a href="/wiki/Sydney" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, where Biocyte laboratories are located and Ambrose is staying. As Ethan stakes out Biocyte, Nyah rekindles her former relationship with Ambrose and relays information to Ethan's team. At a horse racing event, Ambrose meets with Biocyte's CEO, John C. McCloy. He shows McCloy a memory card video of Chimera affecting one of Nekhorvich's colleagues before blackmailing McCloy into cooperating with him. Nyah steals the camera's memory card and delivers it to Ethan. They learn that Chimera has a 20-hour dormant period before it causes death by mass destruction of the victim's <a href="/wiki/Red_blood_cell" title="Red blood cell">red blood cells</a>. Bellerophon can only save the victim if used within that 20-hour window. When Nyah discreetly returns the memory card to Ambrose, he notices it is in the wrong pocket of his jacket.
</p><p>Ethan's team kidnaps McCloy to force him to give up Bellerophon. However, the only Bellerophon samples were taken by Nekhorvich, and are now in Ambrose's hands. Ambrose has the cure, but does not have the virus; unbeknownst to him at the time, Nekhorvich injected himself with Chimera to smuggle it out of Biocyte. Ambrose plans to exchange a sample of Bellerophon to McCloy for a sample of Chimera. Ethan's team breaks into Biocyte to destroy the virus before the exchange can take place. Ambrose, posing as Ethan, tricks Nyah into revealing the plan, then captures Nyah and raids Biocyte to secure the virus. Ethan is able to destroy all but one sample of Chimera before Ambrose intervenes, and a firefight ensues, culminating in the sample being dropped on the floor between Ambrose and Ethan. Ambrose orders Nyah to retrieve the sample; she instead injects herself with it, preventing Ambrose from simply killing her after she retrieved it for him. Nyah insists that Ethan kill her to destroy the virus but Ethan is unwilling to do so. Ambrose takes Nyah away as Ethan escapes from the laboratory.
</p><p>Ambrose releases Nyah to wander the streets of Sydney in a daze, intending to start a pandemic. He offers to sell Bellerophon to McCloy in exchange for stock options, to make him Biocyte's majority shareholder. He predicts that the price of Biocyte's stock will skyrocket due to demand for Bellerophon after the Chimera outbreak. Ethan infiltrates the meeting and steals the remaining samples of Bellerophon. While Ethan is pursued by Ambrose and his men, Luther and Billy locate Nyah, who has wandered to a cliff side, intent on killing herself to prevent the eventual outbreak. Ethan kills Ambrose's men but Ambrose chases him to a beach where Ethan defeats him in a brutal fistfight. With little time left on the 20-hour countdown, Luther reaches Ethan at the beach. As Ethan is about to give Luther the Bellerophon canister, Ambrose recovers and points a gun at Ethan. Ethan throws the canister to Luther and jumps away from Ambrose's shot while kicking up a gun from the sand which he uses to finally kill Ambrose.

Ten years later, Harry has been battling a disjointed life with the Dursleys. After inadvertently causing an accident during a family trip to the zoo, Harry begins receiving unsolicited letters by owls. After the Dursleys escape to an island to avoid more letters, Hagrid re-appears and informs Harry that he is actually a wizard and has been accepted into Hogwarts against the Dursleys' wishes. After taking Harry to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Diagon_Alley" title="Diagon Alley">Diagon Alley</a> to buy his supplies for Hogwarts and a pet owl named Hedwig as a birthday present, Hagrid informs him of his past; Harry's parents <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix_(fictional_organisation)" title="Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)">James and Lily Potter</a> met their demise via a <a href="/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter#Unforgivable_Curses" title="Magic in Harry Potter">Killing Curse</a> at the hands of the malevolent and all-powerful wizard, <a href="/wiki/Lord_Voldemort" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a>. Harry, the only survivor in the chaos, thus becomes well-known in the wizarding world as "The Boy Who Lived".
</p><p>Harry is then taken to <a href="/wiki/London_King%27s_Cross_railway_station" title="London King's Cross railway station">King's Cross station</a> to board a train to Hogwarts, where he meets three other students: <a href="/wiki/Ron_Weasley" title="Ron Weasley">Ron Weasley</a>, whom he quickly befriends; <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a>, an intelligent witch born to <a href="/wiki/Muggle" title="Muggle">muggle</a> parents; and <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>, a child from a wealthy wizarding family whom he immediately clashes with. After arriving at school the students assemble in the Great Hall, where all the first-years are sorted by the <a href="/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Sorting_Hat" title="Magical objects in Harry Potter">Sorting Hat</a> between four houses: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hufflepuff" title="Hufflepuff">Hufflepuff</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ravenclaw" title="Ravenclaw">Ravenclaw</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a>. Although the Sorting Hat considers putting Harry in Slytherin, he is placed into Gryffindor alongside Ron and Hermione.
</p><p>At Hogwarts, Harry begins learning magic spells and discovers more about his past and parents. After recovering the <a href="/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Remembrall" title="Magical objects in Harry Potter">Remembrall</a> of Gryffindor student <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a>, Harry is recruited for Gryffindor's <a href="/wiki/Quidditch" title="Quidditch">Quidditch</a> team as a Seeker, an extremely rare feat for first-year students. While exploring the school one night, Harry, Ron, and Hermione discover a <a href="/wiki/Cerberus" title="Cerberus">giant three-headed dog</a> named Fluffy in a restricted area of the school. Ron then insults Hermione after being embarrassed by her in a charms lesson, causing Hermione to lock herself in the girls' bathroom. She is attacked by a marauding troll but Harry and Ron save her, befriending her in the process.
</p><p>The children later find out Fluffy is guarding the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Philosopher's Stone">Philosopher's Stone</a>, an object that can grant its owner immortality. Harry suspects that potions teacher and head of Slytherin House <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> is trying to obtain the stone in order to return Voldemort to physical form. Hagrid accidentally reveals to the trio that Fluffy will fall asleep if played music. Harry, Ron, and Hermione decide that night to try and find the stone before Snape. They discover an already asleep Fluffy and face a series of safeguards including a deadly plant known as Devil's Snare, a room filled with aggressive flying keys that bruise Harry, and a dangerous life-sized game of <a href="/wiki/Chess" title="Chess">chess</a> that almost kills Ron.
</p><p>After getting past the tasks, Harry discovers that it was <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> teacher <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Quirinus Quirrell</a> who was trying to claim the stone, and that Snape was actually protecting Harry all along. Quirrell removes his turban and reveals a weak Voldemort living on the back of his head. Through an enchantment placed by Dumbledore, Harry finds the stone in his possession. Voldemort attempts to bargain the stone from Harry in exchange for reviving his parents, but Harry refuses, causing Quirrell to attack. Harry kills Quirrell by burning his skin and reducing him to dust, after which Voldemort's spirit rises from Quirrell's ashes and knocks Harry unconscious.
</p><p>Harry recovers in the school hospital with Dumbledore at his side. Dumbledore explains that the stone has been destroyed and that Ron and Hermione are safe. Dumbledore also reveals how Harry was able to defeat Quirrell: when Harry's mother died to save him, her death gave Harry a love-based protection against Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances, tying them for first place with Slytherin. Dumbledore then awards ten points to Neville for attempting to stop the trio, granting Gryffindor the House Cup. Harry returns home for the summer, happy to finally have a real home in Hogwarts.
</p><p>Awakening from a dream of <a href="/wiki/Gandalf" title="Gandalf">Gandalf</a> the Grey battling the <a href="/wiki/Balrog" title="Balrog">Balrog</a>, <a href="/wiki/Frodo_Baggins" title="Frodo Baggins">Frodo Baggins</a> and his friend <a href="/wiki/Samwise_Gamgee" title="Samwise Gamgee">Samwise Gamgee</a> find themselves lost in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emyn_Muil" title="Emyn Muil">Emyn Muil</a> near <a href="/wiki/Mordor" title="Mordor">Mordor</a> and soon become aware that they are being stalked by <a href="/wiki/Gollum" title="Gollum">Gollum</a>, the former owner of the <a href="/wiki/One_Ring" title="One Ring">One Ring</a>. After capturing him, a sympathetic Frodo decides to use Gollum as a guide to Mordor, despite Sam's objections. 
</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Aragorn" title="Aragorn">Aragorn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Legolas" title="Legolas">Legolas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gimli_(Middle-earth)" title="Gimli (Middle-earth)">Gimli</a> pursue the <a href="/wiki/Uruk-hai" title="Uruk-hai">Uruk-hai</a> to save their companions <a href="/wiki/Meriadoc_Brandybuck" title="Meriadoc Brandybuck">Merry</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peregrin_Took" title="Peregrin Took">Pippin</a>. The Uruk-hai are ambushed by the Rohirrim, the exiled army of <a href="/wiki/Rohan_(Middle-earth)" title="Rohan (Middle-earth)">Rohan</a>, while the two <a href="/wiki/Hobbit" title="Hobbit">Hobbits</a> escape into <a href="/wiki/Fangorn" title="Fangorn">Fangorn</a> Forest and encounter the <a href="/wiki/Ent" title="Ent">Ent</a> <a href="/wiki/Treebeard" title="Treebeard">Treebeard</a>. Aragorn's group later meets the Rohirrim and their leader <a href="/wiki/%C3%89omer" title="Éomer">Éomer</a>, who reveals that their king <a href="/wiki/Th%C3%A9oden" title="Théoden">Théoden</a> is being manipulated by <a href="/wiki/Saruman" title="Saruman">Saruman</a>'s servant <a href="/wiki/Gr%C3%ADma_Wormtongue" title="Gríma Wormtongue">Gríma Wormtongue</a> into turning a blind eye to Saruman's forces running rampant in Rohan. While tracking down the Hobbits in Fangorn, Aragorn's group encounters <a href="/wiki/Gandalf" title="Gandalf">Gandalf</a>, who, after succumbing to his injuries while killing the Balrog in <a href="/wiki/Moria_(Middle-earth)" title="Moria (Middle-earth)">Moria</a>, has been resurrected as Gandalf the White to help save <a href="/wiki/Middle-earth" title="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a>.
</p><p>Aragorn's group travels to Rohan's capital city Edoras, where Gandalf releases Théoden from Saruman's influence and Wormtongue is banished. After learning about Saruman's plans to wipe out Rohan with his Uruk-hai army, Théoden decides to move his citizens to <a href="/wiki/Helm%27s_Deep" title="Helm's Deep">Helm's Deep</a>, an ancient fortress that has provided refuge to Rohan's people in times past, while Gandalf departs to acquire the aid of the Rohirrim. Aragorn builds a friendship with Théoden's niece, <a href="/wiki/%C3%89owyn" title="Éowyn">Éowyn</a>, who quickly becomes infatuated with him. When the exodus comes under attack by <a href="/wiki/Warg_(Middle-earth)" title="Warg (Middle-earth)">Warg</a>-riding Orcs, Aragorn falls off a cliff into a river and is presumed dead. However, he is found by his horse <a href="/wiki/List_of_Middle-earth_animals#Brego" title="List of Middle-earth animals">Brego</a> and taken to Helm's Deep. The Uruk-hai army arrives at Helm's Deep that night, finding a makeshift army of civilians and Elves from <a href="/wiki/Lothl%C3%B3rien" title="Lothlórien">Lothlórien</a> waiting for them as a night-long battle follows. Using gunpowder-like explosives on a sewer drain that Wormtongue told Saruman about, the Uruk-hai breach the outer wall and force the remaining defenders to retreat into the inner castle.
</p><p>At Fangorn, Merry and Pippin, having met Gandalf in the forest and convincing Treebeard they were allies, are brought to an Ent Council where the Ents decide not to assist in the war. Pippin then tells Treebeard to take them to a route passing <a href="/wiki/Isengard" title="Isengard">Isengard</a>, where they witness the devastation caused to the forest by Saruman's war efforts. An enraged Treebeard summons the Ents and they storm Isengard, drowning the orcs by breaking their river dam and stranding Saruman in Orthanc. 
</p><p>At Helm's Deep, Aragorn convinces a despairing Theoden to ride out and meet the Uruks in one last charge. Gandalf and the Rohirrim then arrive at sunrise, turning the tide of the battle and decimating the Uruk-hai while those remaining flee and are slaughtered. Despite this victory, Gandalf warns that Sauron's retaliation will be terrible and swift.
</p><p>Meanwhile, becoming loyal to Frodo after taking him and Sam through the <a href="/wiki/Dead_Marshes" title="Dead Marshes">Dead Marshes</a>, Gollum convinces the Hobbits of another entrance besides the <a href="/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth" title="Minor places in Middle-earth">Black Gate</a>. Frodo and Sam are later captured by the <a href="/wiki/Rangers_of_Ithilien" title="Rangers of Ithilien">Rangers of Ithilien</a> led by <a href="/wiki/Faramir" title="Faramir">Faramir</a>, brother of the late <a href="/wiki/Boromir" title="Boromir">Boromir</a>. After torturing Gollum while inadvertently instilling in him the notion that he has been betrayed when Frodo saves him from being killed, Faramir learns of the One Ring and takes his captives with him to <a href="/wiki/Gondor" title="Gondor">Gondor</a> to win his father's respect. While passing through the besieged Gondorian city of <a href="/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth" title="Minor places in Middle-earth">Osgiliath</a>, Sam reveals that Boromir's death was because he was driven mad by and tried to take the Ring. An attacking <a href="/wiki/Nazg%C3%BBl" title="Nazgûl">Nazgûl</a> nearly captures Frodo, who momentarily attacks Sam before coming to his senses, forcing Sam to remind him that they are fighting for the good still left in Middle-earth. Faramir is impressed by Frodo's rekindled hope and releases them along with Gollum. While leading the hobbits once more, Gollum decides to take revenge on Frodo and reclaim the ring by leading the group to "<a href="/wiki/Shelob" title="Shelob">Her</a>" upon arriving at <a href="/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth" title="Minor places in Middle-earth">Cirith Ungol</a>.
</p><p>Two <a href="/wiki/Hobbit" title="Hobbit">Hobbits</a>, Sméagol and <a href="/wiki/D%C3%A9agol" title="Déagol">Déagol</a>, are fishing when Déagol discovers the <a href="/wiki/One_Ring" title="One Ring">One Ring</a> in the river.

He retreats into the <a href="/wiki/Misty_Mountains" title="Misty Mountains">Misty Mountains</a> as the Ring twists his body and mind, until he becomes the creature <a href="/wiki/Gollum" title="Gollum">Gollum</a>.

Gandalf retrieves the defeated <a href="/wiki/Saruman" title="Saruman">Saruman</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Palant%C3%ADr" title="Palantír">palantír</a></i>. Pippin later looks into the seeing-stone, and is telepathically attacked by <a href="/wiki/Sauron" title="Sauron">Sauron</a>. Gandalf deduces that Sauron will attack <a href="/wiki/Gondor" title="Gondor">Gondor</a>'s capital <a href="/wiki/Minas_Tirith" title="Minas Tirith">Minas Tirith</a>. He rides there to warn Gondor's steward <a href="/wiki/Denethor" title="Denethor">Denethor</a>, taking Pippin with him.
</p><p>Gollum leads <a href="/wiki/Frodo_Baggins" title="Frodo Baggins">Frodo Baggins</a> and <a href="/wiki/Samwise_Gamgee" title="Samwise Gamgee">Samwise Gamgee</a> to <a href="/wiki/Minas_Morgul" title="Minas Morgul">Minas Morgul</a>. The hobbits begin climbing a stair carved in the cliff face that will take them into Mordor via a 'secret way' - unaware that Gollum plans to kill them and take the Ring. Sauron's army strikes and overwhelms <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Osgiliath" title="Osgiliath">Osgiliath</a>, forcing <a href="/wiki/Faramir" title="Faramir">Faramir</a> and his garrison to retreat to Minas Tirith.
</p><p>Gollum disposes of the Hobbits' food, blaming Sam. Frodo tells Sam to go home, before Frodo and Gollum continue to the tunnel leading to Mordor, where Gollum tricks him into venturing into the lair of the giant spider <a href="/wiki/Shelob" title="Shelob">Shelob</a>. Frodo narrowly escapes and confronts Gollum, telling him that he must destroy the Ring for both their sakes. Gollum attacks Frodo, but falls down a chasm. Frodo continues on, but Shelob discovers, paralyses and binds him. However, Sam arrives and drives her away. Sam hides as <a href="/wiki/Orc" title="Orc">Orcs</a> appear and take Frodo with them. Sam follows the Orcs into the Tower of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cirith_Ungol" title="Cirith Ungol">Cirith Ungol</a>, and frees Frodo so they can continue their journey.
</p><p>Aragorn learns from <a href="/wiki/Elrond" title="Elrond">Elrond</a> that <a href="/wiki/Arwen" title="Arwen">Arwen</a> is dying, having refused to leave Middle Earth after seeing a vision of <a href="/wiki/Eldarion" title="Eldarion">her son with Aragorn</a>. Elrond gives Aragorn <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/And%C3%BAril" title="Andúril">Andúril</a>, <a href="/wiki/Isildur" title="Isildur">Isildur</a>'s sword <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Narsil" title="Narsil">Narsil</a> reforged, so he can reclaim his birthright while gaining reinforcements from the <a href="/wiki/Dead_Men_of_Dunharrow" title="Dead Men of Dunharrow">Dead Men of Dunharrow</a>. Joined by Legolas and Gimli, Aragorn travels to the <a href="/wiki/Paths_of_the_Dead" title="Paths of the Dead">Paths of the Dead</a>, recruiting the Army of the Dead by pledging to release them from the curse Isildur put on them. Faramir is gravely wounded after a futile effort to retake Osgiliath; believing his son to be dead, Denethor falls into madness. Gandalf is left to defend the city against the Orc army, led by <a href="/wiki/Gothmog_(Third_Age)" title="Gothmog (Third Age)">Gothmog</a>. As Gothmog's army forces its way into the city, Denethor attempts to kill himself and Faramir on a <a href="/wiki/Pyre" title="Pyre">pyre</a>. Pippin alerts Gandalf and they save Faramir, but a burning Denethor leaps to his death from the top of Minas Tirith just before Théoden and his nephew, <a href="/wiki/%C3%89omer" title="Éomer">Éomer</a>, arrive with the Rohirrim. During the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Pelennor_Fields" title="Battle of the Pelennor Fields">ensuing battle</a>, they are overwhelmed by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oliphaunt" title="Oliphaunt">Oliphaunt</a>-riding <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Haradrim" title="Haradrim">Haradrim</a>, while the <a href="/wiki/Witch-king_of_Angmar" title="Witch-king of Angmar">Witch-king of Angmar</a> mortally wounds Théoden. Though Théoden's niece <a href="/wiki/%C3%89owyn" title="Éowyn">Éowyn</a> destroys the Witch-King with Merry's help, Théoden dies of his wounds. Aragorn arrives with the Army of the Dead, who overcome the Orcs and win the battle; Aragorn then frees them from the curse. Aragorn decides to lead his army upon the Black Gate as a distraction, so Frodo and Sam can get to <a href="/wiki/Mount_Doom" title="Mount Doom">Mount Doom</a>.
</p><p>Aragorn's army <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Morannon" title="Battle of the Morannon">draw out Sauron's forces</a> and empties Mordor, allowing Frodo and Sam to reach the volcano, but Gollum attacks them just as they reach Mount Doom. Frodo succumbs to the Ring and claims it as his own. Gollum attacks Frodo and bites his finger off to reclaim the Ring. Frodo fights back and knocks Gollum, who is holding the Ring, into the volcano, destroying the Ring and killing Gollum. As Frodo and Sam escape, Sauron is destroyed and Mordor crumbles. Gandalf flies in with <a href="/wiki/Eagle_(Middle-earth)" title="Eagle (Middle-earth)">eagles</a> to rescue the Hobbits, who awaken later in Minas Tirith and are reunited with the surviving Fellowship members. Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor and takes Arwen as his queen.

</p><p>Newlyweds <a href="/wiki/Shrek_(character)" title="Shrek (character)">Shrek</a> and <a href="/wiki/Princess_Fiona" title="Princess Fiona">Fiona</a> return from their honeymoon to find they have been invited by Fiona's parents to a royal ball to celebrate their marriage. Shrek refuses to go at first, but Fiona talks him into it, and along with <a href="/wiki/Donkey_(Shrek)" title="Donkey (Shrek)">Donkey</a>, they travel to the kingdom of Far Far Away. They meet Fiona's parents, King Harold and Queen Lillian, who are shocked to see both their daughter and son-in-law are ogres, with Harold particularly repulsed. At dinner, Shrek and Harold get into a heated argument over how Shrek and Fiona will raise their family, and Fiona, disgusted at Shrek and Harold's behavior, locks herself away in her room that evening. Shrek worries that he has lost his true love, particularly after finding her childhood diary and reading that she was once infatuated with Prince Charming.
</p><p>Harold is reprimanded by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fairy_Godmother_(Shrek)" title="Fairy Godmother (Shrek)">Fairy Godmother</a> and her son Prince Charming by reminding him that Charming was to marry Fiona in exchange for his own happy ending. She implores him to find a way of getting rid of Shrek. Harold arranges for Shrek and Donkey to join him on a fictitious hunting trip, which is actually a trap to lure them into the hands of an assassin, <a href="/wiki/Puss_in_Boots_(Shrek)" title="Puss in Boots (Shrek)">Puss in Boots</a>. Unable to defeat Shrek, Puss reveals that he was paid by Harold and offers to come along and make amends. The three sneak into the Fairy Godmother's potion factory and steal a "Happily Ever After" potion that Shrek thinks will restore Fiona's love for him.
</p><p>Shrek and Donkey both drink the potion and fall into a deep sleep, awakening the next morning to discover its effects: Shrek is now a handsome man while Donkey has turned into an elegant white stallion. In order to make the change permanent, Shrek must kiss Fiona by midnight. Shrek, Donkey and Puss return to the castle to discover that the potion has transformed Fiona back into her former human self as well. However, the Fairy Godmother, having discovered the potion's theft, intercepts Shrek and sends Charming to pose as him and win Fiona's love. At the Fairy Godmother's urging, Shrek leaves the castle, thinking that the best way to make Fiona happy is to let her go.
</p><p>To ensure that Fiona falls in love with Charming, the Fairy Godmother gives Harold a love potion to put into Fiona's tea. This exchange is overheard by Shrek, Donkey and Puss, who are arrested by the royal guards and thrown into a dungeon. While the royal ball begins, several of Shrek's friends band together to free the trio with the help of The Muffin Man's monster-sized <a href="/wiki/Gingerbread_man" title="Gingerbread man">gingerbread man</a>, which breaks through the castle's defenses. Shrek is too late to prevent Charming from kissing Fiona, but instead of falling in love with Charming, Fiona knocks him out with a headbutt. Harold reveals that he never gave Fiona the love potion, whereupon the now-enraged Fairy Godmother attacks Shrek. In the ensuing melee, Harold sacrifices himself to save Shrek; his armor ricochets a spell cast by the Fairy Godmother which disintegrates her, and Harold is turned back into the <a href="/wiki/The_Frog_Prince" title="The Frog Prince">Frog Prince</a>, his original form. Harold gives his blessing to the marriage and apologizes for his earlier behavior, admitting his use of the Happily Ever After potion years earlier to gain Lillian's love.
</p><p>As the clock strikes midnight, Fiona rejects Shrek's offer to remain humans, and they happily let the potion's effects wear off and revert to their ogre forms, while Donkey changes back to his natural form as well. In the mid-credits scene, Dragon, who had previously romanced Donkey, reveals that they now have several dragon-donkey hybrid babies, much to his surprise.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_(character)" title="Harry Potter (character)">Harry</a> awakens from a nightmare wherein a man named <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Frank_Bryce" title="Frank Bryce">Frank Bryce</a> is killed after overhearing <a href="/wiki/Lord_Voldemort" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> conspiring with <a href="/wiki/Death_Eater#Peter_Pettigrew" title="Death Eater">Peter Pettigrew</a> and another man.

He also announces that the school will host an event known as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Triwizard_Tournament" title="Triwizard Tournament">Triwizard Tournament</a>, in which three magical schools compete across three dangerous challenges. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Goblet_of_Fire" title="Goblet of Fire">Goblet of Fire</a> selects "champions" to take part in the competition: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric Diggory</a> of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hufflepuff" title="Hufflepuff">Hufflepuff</a> representing Hogwarts, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Viktor_Krum" title="Viktor Krum">Viktor Krum</a> representing the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Durmstrang_Institute" title="Durmstrang Institute">Durmstrang Institute</a> from Eastern Europe, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fleur_Delacour" title="Fleur Delacour">Fleur Delacour</a> representing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Beauxbatons_Academy_of_Magic" title="Beauxbatons Academy of Magic">Beauxbatons Academy of Magic</a> from <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>. The Goblet then unexpectedly selects Harry as a fourth champion. Dumbledore is unable to pull the underage Harry out of the tournament, as Ministry official <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Barty_Crouch_Sr." title="Barty Crouch Sr.">Barty Crouch Sr.</a> insists that the champions are bound by a contract after being selected.
</p><p>For the first task, each champion must retrieve a golden egg guarded by the dragon they pick. Harry succeeds in retrieving the egg, which contains information about the second challenge. Shortly after, a formal dance event known as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Yule_Ball" title="Yule Ball">Yule Ball</a> takes place; Harry's crush <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cho_Chang" title="Cho Chang">Cho Chang</a> attends with Cedric, and Hermione attends with Viktor, making Ron jealous. The second task involves the champions diving underwater to rescue their mates. Harry finishes third, but is promoted to second behind Cedric due to his "moral fibre", after saving Fleur's sister Gabrielle as well as Ron. Afterwards, Harry discovers the corpse of Crouch Sr. in the forest. Later, while waiting for Dumbledore in his office, Harry discovers a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pensieve" title="Pensieve">Pensieve</a>, which holds Dumbledore's memories. Harry witnesses a trial in which <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Igor_Karkaroff" title="Igor Karkaroff">Igor Karkaroff</a> confesses to the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic" title="Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> names of other Death Eaters after Voldemort's defeat. When he names <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> as one, Dumbledore vouches for Snape's innocence; Snape turned spy against Voldemort before the latter's downfall. After Karkaroff names Barty Crouch Jr., a devastated Crouch Sr. imprisons his son in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a>. Exiting the Pensieve, Harry realizes that Crouch Jr. is the man he saw in his dream.
</p><p>For the final task, the champions must reach the Triwizard Cup, located in a <a href="/wiki/Hedge_maze" title="Hedge maze">hedge maze</a>. After Fleur and Viktor are incapacitated, Harry and Cedric reach the cup together. The two claim a draw and together grab the cup, which turns out to be a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Portkey" title="Portkey">Portkey</a> and transports them to a graveyard where Pettigrew and Voldemort are waiting. Pettigrew kills Cedric with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Avada_Kedavra" title="Avada Kedavra">Killing Curse</a> and performs a ritual that rejuvenates Voldemort, who then summons the Death Eaters. Voldemort releases Harry and challenges him to a duel to prove he is the better wizard. A vulnerable Harry tries the Expelliarmus charm to block Voldemort's attempted Killing Curse. The beams from their wands entwine and Voldemort's wand disgorges the last spells it performed. The spirits of the people he murdered are seen in the graveyard: first Cedric, then Frank Bryce, then Bertha Jorkins,   and finally <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lily_and_James_Potter" title="Lily and James Potter">Harry's parents</a>.  This distracts Voldemort and his Death Eaters, allowing Harry to use the Portkey and escape with Cedric's body.
</p><p>Harry tells Dumbledore that Voldemort returned and killed Cedric. Moody takes Harry back to his office to interrogate him about Voldemort, but inadvertently blows his cover by asking Harry whether there were "others in the graveyard", despite Harry not mentioning a graveyard. Moody reveals that he submitted Harry's name to the Goblet of Fire and manipulated Harry throughout the tournament to ensure he would win. Moody attempts to attack Harry, but Dumbledore, Snape, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a> intervene and subdue him. The teachers force Moody to drink <a href="/wiki/Potions_in_Harry_Potter#Veritaserum" title="Potions in Harry Potter">Veritaserum</a>, and he reveals that the real Moody is imprisoned in a magical trunk as his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polyjuice_Potion" title="Polyjuice Potion">Polyjuice Potion</a> wears off. He is revealed as Crouch Jr. and returned to Azkaban.
</p><p>Dumbledore reveals to the students that Voldemort killed Cedric, although the Ministry of Magic opposes the revelation. Later, Dumbledore visits Harry in his dormitory, apologizing to him for the dangers he endured. Harry reveals that he saw his parents in the graveyard; Dumbledore names this effect as "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Priori_Incantatem" title="Priori Incantatem">Priori Incantatem</a>".

Norrington has resigned and disappeared after losing the Navy's <a href="/wiki/Flagship" title="Flagship">flagship</a>, HMS <i>Dauntless</i>, in a hurricane while pursuing Jack. Meanwhile, Jack is visited by Will's father, <a href="/wiki/Bootstrap_Bill_Turner" title="Bootstrap Bill Turner">Bootstrap Bill Turner</a>, aboard the <i><a href="/wiki/Black_Pearl" title="Black Pearl">Black Pearl</a></i>. Bootstrap is now a crewman on the <i><a href="/wiki/Flying_Dutchman_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" title="Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)">Flying Dutchman</a></i>, captained by <a href="/wiki/Davy_Jones_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" title="Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)">Davy Jones</a>.

Beckett, meanwhile, promises to free Elizabeth if Will brings him Jack's magic compass which points to whatever the holder wants most.
</p><p>Will finds Jack and the crew on an island and frees them from <a href="/wiki/Cannibalism" title="Cannibalism">cannibals</a>. Shortly after, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_characters#Governor_Swann" title="List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters">Governor Swann</a> frees Elizabeth from jail, but he is then captured. Elizabeth bargains with Beckett to find the compass. Disguised as a cabin boy aboard a Scottish merchant vessel, she makes her way to Tortuga where she later finds Jack and also a drunken Norrington. After escaping the cannibals, Jack and the crew visit <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/voodoo" title="wikt:voodoo">voodoo</a> priestess <a href="/wiki/Tia_Dalma" title="Tia Dalma">Tia Dalma</a>, who reveals Jones' weakness is his heart, which is locked within the Dead Man's Chest. Jack must find it and the key that opens it. Locating the <i>Dutchman</i>, Will makes a deal with Jack to find the key to the chest in return for Jack's compass. Jack tricks Will, who is <a href="/wiki/Shanghaiing" title="Shanghaiing">shanghaied</a> into service aboard the <i>Dutchman</i>. Jones agrees to release Jack from their bargain in exchange for one hundred souls. Will meets his father aboard the <i>Dutchman</i> and learns that Jones possesses the key to the chest. They play a game of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Liar%27s_Dice" title="Liar's Dice">Liar's Dice</a> against Jones to try and win the key, but they lose. Despite this, Will escapes with the key and is taken aboard the same ship Elizabeth was on. Jones sends the Kraken after him, sinking the ship, but Will escapes.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/List_of_locations_in_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean#Tortuga" title="List of locations in Pirates of the Caribbean">Tortuga</a>, Jack hires a new crew, including Elizabeth and Norrington. With Elizabeth's use of Jack's compass, they are able to locate the chest. All parties arrive on <a href="/wiki/List_of_locations_in_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean#Isla_Cruces" title="List of locations in Pirates of the Caribbean">Isla Cruces</a>, where the chest is buried, but a three-way sword fight breaks out between Jack, Will, and Norrington, who all want the heart for their respective goals: Jack wants to call off the Kraken; Will wants to rescue his father; and Norrington wants to regain his life as a Navy officer. In the chaos, Norrington secretly steals the heart and runs off, pretending to lure away the <i>Dutchman</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s crew. Jones attacks the <i>Pearl</i> with the Kraken, which kills most of the crew and destroys all but one of the <i>Pearl</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s lifeboats, but Jack, who briefly flees the battle, returns and wounds the Kraken with a net full of gunpowder and rum.
</p><p>Jack orders the survivors to abandon ship, but Elizabeth, realizing the Kraken only wants Jack, tricks him and chains him to the mast so that the crew can escape. The Kraken drags Jack and the <i>Pearl</i> to Davy Jones' Locker. Jones opens the chest to discover his heart is gone. In Port Royal, Norrington gives Beckett the heart and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Letters_of_Marque" title="Letters of Marque">Letters of Marque</a> meant for Jack, allowing him back into the navy as well as allowing Beckett to gain control of Davy Jones and the seas. The <i>Pearl</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s crew take shelter with Tia Dalma, where they all agree to rescue Jack. Tia Dalma introduces the captain who will guide them: the resurrected <a href="/wiki/Hector_Barbossa" title="Hector Barbossa">Hector Barbossa</a>.

</p><p>The crew travels to the Locker and rescues Jack. The crew encounters many dead souls, including Elizabeth's father <a href="/wiki/Weatherby_Swann" title="Weatherby Swann">Governor Swann</a>, who was executed by Beckett. Tia Dalma reveals that the Goddess Calypso charged Davy Jones with the job to guide the souls of those who died at sea to the next world. Once every ten years he could come ashore to be with the woman he loved. But he corrupted his purpose and was cursed to become a monster. The soul of Governor Swann reveals that the <i>Dutchman</i> must always have a captain.
</p><p>Returning to the living world, the <i>Pearl</i> stops at an island for fresh water, where the crew find the <a href="/wiki/Kraken_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" title="Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)">Kraken</a> lying dead on the beach, having been killed by Jones under orders from Beckett. They are then attacked by Sao Feng and Beckett's men.

Jack throws Will off the ship as part of the plan to seize control of the <i>Dutchman</i>. Sao Feng tells Elizabeth that the first Brethren Court bound Calypso in human form after she betrayed her lover, Davy Jones. He plans to release her to defeat Beckett. Davy Jones attacks Feng's ship, the <i>Empress</i>, mortally wounding Feng in the process. Feng appoints Elizabeth his successor as Pirate Lord before dying. Elizabeth and the crew are locked in the brig of the <i>Dutchman</i>, where she finds a partially insane Bootstrap Bill Turner. In a moment of clarity, Bootstrap reveals that whoever kills Davy Jones must take his place, bound to serve the <i>Dutchman</i> forever. He reiterates that "the <i>Dutchman</i> must always have a captain." <a href="/wiki/James_Norrington" title="James Norrington">Admiral Norrington</a> frees Elizabeth and her new crew from the <i>Dutchman</i>, but is killed by Bootstrap Bill.
</p><p>The <i>Black Pearl</i> arrives at Shipwreck Cove, where Barbossa attempts to persuade the Brethren Court to release Calypso. Davy Jones visits Tia Dalma in the <i>Pearl</i>'s brig, revealing she is Calypso. Jack's father <a href="/wiki/List_of_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_characters#Captain_Teague" title="List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters">Captain Teague</a>, Keeper of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pirate_Code" title="Pirate Code">Pirate Code</a>, informs the Court that only an elected Pirate King can decide on going into battle.

</p><p>The <i>Pearl</i> and the <i>Dutchman</i> battle in the maelstrom. Elizabeth and Will are wed by Barbossa. On board the <i>Dutchman</i>, Jones and Jack engage in a duel for control of Davy Jones' heart. Jones stabs Will, mortally wounding him. Jack gives up his chance for immortality and instead helps Will stab the heart, killing Jones, whose body falls into the maelstrom. Jack and Elizabeth escape the <i>Dutchman</i> as it is sucked into the maelstrom.
</p><p>As Beckett's ship, the <i>Endeavour</i>, approaches to destroy the <i>Pearl</i>, the <i>Dutchman</i> rises from the sea, now captained by Will; the crew has been freed from Jones' curse. Together, the two pirate ships destroy the <i>Endeavour</i>. A stunned Beckett goes down with his ship while his navy retreats. With Will now forever bound to escort souls lost at sea to the next world, he and Elizabeth bid farewell to each other on the beach of an abandoned island.

The Joker interrupts the meeting to warn them that Batman is unhindered by the law, and offers to kill him in exchange for half of their money. The mob bosses disagree, and a bounty is placed on the Joker by Gambol. The Joker finds and kills Gambol, taking over his gang. The mob ultimately decides to take the Joker up on his offer. Batman finds Lau in Hong Kong and brings him back to Gotham to testify, allowing Dent to apprehend the entire mob. The Joker threatens to keep killing people unless Batman reveals his identity, and starts by murdering Police Commissioner <a href="/wiki/Gillian_B._Loeb" title="Gillian B. Loeb">Gillian B. Loeb</a> and the judge presiding over the mob trial. The Joker also tries to kill Mayor Anthony Garcia, but Gordon sacrifices himself to stop the assassination. Dent kidnaps one of Joker’s henchmen and threatens him with a seemingly deadly game of heads-or-tails using Dent's lucky coin, which is revealed to be heads on both sides. Dent learns that Rachel is Joker's next target.
</p><p>Bruce decides to reveal his secret identity to prevent more deaths. Before he can, however, Dent falsely announces that <i>he</i> is Batman. Dent is taken into protective custody, but the Joker appears and attacks the convoy. Batman comes to Dent's rescue and Gordon, who faked his death, apprehends the Joker, securing a promotion to Commissioner. Rachel and Dent are escorted away by detectives on Maroni's payroll; Gordon later learns that they never arrived home. Batman interrogates the Joker, who reveals that they have been trapped in separate locations rigged with explosives and that Batman must choose one to save. Batman races to save Rachel, while Gordon attempts to rescue Dent. Batman arrives at the building, but realizes that the Joker sent him to Dent's location instead. Both buildings explode, killing Rachel and disfiguring half of Dent's face. The Joker escapes with Lau, who leads him to the Mob's funds. The Joker burns the money before killing Lau and the Chechen.
</p><p>Coleman Reese, an accountant at <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Enterprises" title="Wayne Enterprises">Wayne Enterprises</a>, deduces that Bruce is Batman and threatens to publicize the information. Not wanting Reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the Joker threatens to destroy a hospital unless Reese is killed within an hour. All hospitals are evacuated and Gordon travels to secure Reese. The Joker, disguised as a hospital nurse, discovers Dent's ward and hands him a gun, convincing him to seek revenge for Rachel's death. The Joker then destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. Dent goes on a killing spree, deciding the fates of people he holds responsible for Rachel's death by flipping his lucky coin, which was disfigured on one face by the explosion. Dent eventually apprehends Gordon's family, believing Gordon's love for his family parallels his love for Rachel.
</p><p>After announcing that Gotham City will be subject to his rule by nightfall, the Joker rigs two evacuating ferries with explosives; one containing civilians and the other containing prisoners. The passengers have been supplied with a trigger to the other boat's explosives, and the Joker announces through an intercom that he will blow both ferries if one of them has not been destroyed by midnight. Batman finds the Joker by using a sonar device that spies on the entire city, with the reluctant help of <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Fox" title="Lucius Fox">Lucius Fox</a>. Both the civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while Batman apprehends the Joker after a brief fight. Before the police arrive to take the Joker into custody, he gloats that Gotham's citizens will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes public knowledge.
</p><p>Gordon and Batman arrive at the building where Rachel perished and find Dent threatening to kill Gordon's family. Dent again flips his coin and shoots Batman, spares himself, and aims to kill Gordon's son while claiming that Gordon's negligence is responsible for Rachel's death. Before he can flip his coin for the boy, Batman, who was wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the building to his death. Batman persuades Gordon to let him take responsibility for the killing spree to preserve Dent's heroic image. As the police launch a manhunt for Batman, Gordon destroys the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bat-signal" title="Bat-signal">Bat-signal</a>, Fox watches as the sonar device self-destructs, and <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred</a> burns a letter from Rachel saying she plans to marry Dent.

</p><p>In 2154, humans have depleted <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>'s natural resources, leading to a severe energy crisis. The Resources Development Administration (RDA for short) mines for a valuable mineral — <a href="/wiki/Unobtainium" title="Unobtainium">unobtanium</a> — on Pandora, a densely forested <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Habitable_moon" title="Habitable moon">habitable moon</a> orbiting the <a href="/wiki/Gas_giant" title="Gas giant">gas giant</a> Polyphemus in the <a href="/wiki/Alpha_Centauri" title="Alpha Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a> star system.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Horwitz2009_11-1"><a href="#cite_note-Horwitz2009-11">[11]</a></sup> Pandora, whose atmosphere is poisonous to humans, is inhabited by the <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere#Naʼvi" title="Pandoran biosphere">Na'vi</a>, a species of 10-foot tall (3.0 m), blue-skinned, <a href="/wiki/Wisdom" title="Wisdom">sapient</a> humanoids<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> that live in harmony with nature and worship a <a href="/wiki/Mother_goddess" title="Mother goddess">mother goddess</a> named Eywa.
</p><p>To explore <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere" title="Pandoran biosphere">Pandora's biosphere</a>, scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called "avatars", operated by genetically matched humans; Jake Sully, a paraplegic former <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_Marine" title="United States Marine">Marine</a>, replaces his deceased identical twin brother as an operator of one. Dr. Grace Augustine, head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement but accepts his assignment as a bodyguard. While protecting the avatars of Grace and fellow scientist Dr. Norm Spellman as they collect biological data, Jake's avatar is attacked by a <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere#Fauna" title="Pandoran biosphere">thanator</a> and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Witnessing an auspicious sign, she takes him to her clan, whereupon Neytiri's mother Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Colonel" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's <a href="/wiki/Private_military_company" title="Private military company">private security force</a>, promises Jake that the company will restore his legs if he gathers information about the Na'vi and the clan's gathering place, a giant tree called Hometree,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Script25_36-0"><a href="#cite_note-Script25-36">[36]</a></sup> which stands above the richest deposit of unobtanium in the area. When Grace learns of this, she transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/outpost" title="wikt:outpost">outpost</a>. Over the following three months, Jake grows to sympathize with the natives. After Jake is initiated into the tribe, he and Neytiri choose each other as mates, and soon afterward, Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he attempts to disable a bulldozer that threatens to destroy a sacred Na'vi site. When Quaritch shows a video recording of Jake's attack on the bulldozer to Administrator Parker Selfridge,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Script8and15_37-0"><a href="#cite_note-Script8and15-37">[37]</a></sup> and another in which Jake admits that the Na'vi will never abandon Hometree, Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed.
</p><p>Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biological_neural_network" title="Biological neural network">biological neural network</a> native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate before commencing the attack. While trying to warn the Na'vi, Jake confesses to being a spy, and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Seeing this, Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, frees Jake and Grace and airlifts them to Grace's outpost, but during the escape Quaritch fires at them, hitting Grace.
</p><p>To regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fictional_universe_in_Avatar#The_Tree_of_Souls" title="Fictional universe in Avatar">Tree of Souls</a> and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can be completed. Supported by the new chief Tsu'tey, Jake speaks to unite the clan and tells them to gather all of the clans to battle against the RDA. Noticing the impending gathering, Quaritch organizes a <a href="/wiki/Preemptive_war" title="Preemptive war">pre-emptive strike</a> against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives. On the eve of battle, Jake prays to Eywa, via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na'vi.
</p><p>During the subsequent battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy; but are rescued when <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Characters_and_wildlife_in_Avatar#Fauna" title="Characters and wildlife in Avatar">Pandoran wildlife</a> unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch, wearing an <a href="/wiki/Mecha" title="Mecha">AMP suit</a>, escapes from his own damaged aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation.
</p><p>With the exceptions of Jake, Norm and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora and sent back to Earth, after which Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.

When they found Sunnyside, Lotso took over it, turning it into a toy prison, and Chuckles only escaped because Bonnie took him home for repair.
</p><p>At Sunnyside, Andy's toys are horrified at the toddlers' rough play. Buzz asks Lotso to move the toys to the older children's room, but Lotso turns on Buzz and restores him to original factory setting, erasing his memory. Mrs. Potato Head, through an eye she lost in Andy's room, sees Andy searching for them. They realize Woody was telling the truth and try to leave. Andy's toys are imprisoned by Lotso's henchmen who rely on "new recruits" to save themselves from the preschoolers' abuse.
</p><p>Woody returns to Sunnyside and learns from a <a href="/wiki/Chatter_Telephone" title="Chatter Telephone">Chatter Telephone</a> that the only way out is through the trash. Andy's toys accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Spanish Buzz promptly allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso's gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals Lotso's deception to Big Baby, who throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso's henchmen retreat and Lotso drags Woody into the dumpster as the truck collects the trash. The rest of the toys fall into the truck while trying to rescue him, except Barbie, Ken and Big Baby. A falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and personality. The truck brings the toys to a landfill, where the Aliens are swept away by spotting an industrial claw and the other toys are deposited on a conveyor belt that leads to an <a href="/wiki/Incineration" title="Incineration">incinerator</a>. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate and prepare to die, but are rescued by the Aliens operating the claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who ties him to his truck's radiator <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grille_(motor_vehicle)" title="Grille (motor vehicle)">grille</a> and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.
</p><p>Woody leaves a note for Andy, who, thinking the note is from his mother, donates the toys to Bonnie. To Andy's surprise, Woody is at the bottom of the donation box and Bonnie recognizes him. Though hesitant at first, Andy passes Woody on to Bonnie, and they play together before he leaves. Woody and the other toys witness Andy's departure as they begin their new lives with Bonnie.
</p><p>In the credits scene, Barbie, Ken, and Big Baby have made vast improvements to Sunnyside and maintain contact with the other toys through letters. After parachuting in, the army men are welcomed to Sunnyside.

Goyle casts a Fiendfyre curse; unable to control it, he is burned to death while Harry and his friends save Malfoy and Zabini. Harry stabs the diadem with the Basilisk fang and Ron kicks it into the Room of Requirement to be destroyed. As Voldemort's army attacks, Harry, seeing into Voldemort's mind, realises that Voldemort's snake <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nagini_(Harry_Potter)" title="Nagini (Harry Potter)">Nagini</a> is the final Horcrux. After entering the boathouse, the trio witness Voldemort telling Snape that the Elder Wand cannot serve Voldemort until Snape dies; he then orders Nagini to kill Snape.

Following her death, Snape worked with <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> to protect Harry from Voldemort due to his love for Lily. Harry also learns that Dumbledore was dying and wished for Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe he saw in the woods that led him to the sword was conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him; he must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within him. Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort in the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts#Forbidden_Forest" title="Hogwarts">Forbidden Forest</a>.

In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Tesseract_12-0"><a href="#cite_note-Tesseract-12">[N 2]</a></sup> a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. <a href="/wiki/Nick_Fury" title="Nick Fury">Nick Fury</a>, director of the espionage agency <a href="/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D." title="S.H.I.E.L.D.">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a>, and his lieutenant Agent <a href="/wiki/Maria_Hill" title="Maria Hill">Maria Hill</a> arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. <a href="/wiki/Erik_Selvig" title="Erik Selvig">Erik Selvig</a> is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent <a href="/wiki/Phil_Coulson" title="Phil Coulson">Phil Coulson</a> explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a <a href="/wiki/Wormhole" title="Wormhole">wormhole</a>, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a few other agents, including <a href="/wiki/Hawkeye_(comics)" title="Hawkeye (comics)">Clint Barton</a>, to aid him in his getaway.
</p><p>In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the "<a href="/wiki/Avengers_(comics)" title="Avengers (comics)">Avengers Initiative</a>". Agent <a href="/wiki/Black_Widow_(Natasha_Romanova)" title="Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)">Natasha Romanoff</a> is sent to <a href="/wiki/Kolkata" title="Kolkata">Calcutta</a> to recruit <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Banner_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)" title="Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)">Dr. Bruce Banner</a> to trace the Tesseract through its <a href="/wiki/Gamma_ray" title="Gamma ray">gamma radiation</a> emissions.

</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Stuttgart" title="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>, Barton steals <a href="/wiki/Iridium" title="Iridium">iridium</a> needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., <a href="/wiki/Thor_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)" title="Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)">Thor</a>, his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the <a href="/wiki/Helicarrier" title="Helicarrier">Helicarrier</a>. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.
</p><p>The Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk falls to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above <a href="/wiki/Stark_Tower" title="Stark Tower">Stark Tower</a> to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.
</p><p>Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's location. Banner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians. The Hulk finds Loki and beats him into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at <a href="/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan" title="Midtown Manhattan">Midtown Manhattan</a>. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed.

</p><p>Princess <a href="/wiki/Elsa_(Frozen)" title="Elsa (Frozen)">Elsa</a> of Arendelle possesses paranormal powers that allows her to control and create ice and snow, often using it to play with her younger sister, <a href="/wiki/Anna_(Frozen)" title="Anna (Frozen)">Anna</a>. After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents, the King and Queen, take both siblings to a colony of trolls led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna, but alters her memories to remove traces of Elsa's magic, warning Elsa that she must learn to control her powers. The King and Queen isolate both sisters within the castle. Elsa shuts Anna out, causing a rift between them. Unable to control it, Elsa can only suppress her power, causing her to  become more insecure. When the sisters are teenagers, their parents die at sea during a storm.
</p><p>When Elsa turns 21, she is to be crowned queen of Arendelle. She is terrified that the kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear her. The castle gates open to the public and visiting dignitaries for the first time in years. Among them is the scheming Duke of Weselton and the dashing <a href="/wiki/Hans_(Frozen)" title="Hans (Frozen)">Prince Hans</a> of the Southern Isles, the latter of whom Anna falls in love with <a href="/wiki/Love_at_first_sight" title="Love at first sight">at first sight</a>. Elsa's <a href="/wiki/Coronation" title="Coronation">coronation</a> happens without a hitch, but she still remains distant from Anna. When Hans proposes to Anna, Elsa objects, accidentally unleashing her powers before the court; the Duke brands her a monster. Elsa flees to the North Mountain, where she builds a palace of ice in which to live a <a href="/wiki/Hermit" title="Hermit">hermit</a> life. In the process, however, her suppressed magic engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter.
</p><p>Anna ventures out to find Elsa and end the winter, leaving Hans in command. She gets lost, collecting supplies at Wandering Oaken's shop. She meets an <a href="/wiki/Iceman_(occupation)" title="Iceman (occupation)">ice harvester</a> named <a href="/wiki/Kristoff_(Frozen)" title="Kristoff (Frozen)">Kristoff</a> and his <a href="/wiki/Reindeer" title="Reindeer">reindeer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sven_(Frozen)" title="Sven (Frozen)">Sven</a>, convincing them to take her to the mountains.

When Anna's horse returns to Arendelle, Hans sets out to find Anna and Elsa, accompanied by the Duke's minions, who have secret orders to kill Elsa.
</p><p>Reaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa, but when she reveals what has become of Arendelle, Elsa becomes upset, saying that she cannot undo it, and accidentally freezes Anna's heart. She then makes a giant snow monster named Marshmallow, who chases Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf away. Anna's hair begins turning white, so Kristoff takes her to meet the trolls, his adoptive family. Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless "an act of true love" reverses the spell. Kristoff races Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss. Hans and his men reach Elsa's palace, defeating Marshmallow and capturing Elsa. Anna is delivered to Hans but, rather than kissing her, Hans instead reveals that he has actually been plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters. Hans locks Anna in a room to die, and then manipulates the dignitaries into believing that Elsa killed her. He orders the queen's execution, only to discover she has escaped her detention cell.
</p><p>Olaf frees Anna, and they venture into the <a href="/wiki/Blizzard" title="Blizzard">blizzard</a> outside to meet Kristoff, whom Olaf reveals is in love with her. Hans confronts Elsa outside, claiming that she killed Anna, causing Elsa to break down. Anna spots Hans about to kill Elsa; she leaps in the way and freezes solid, stopping Hans. Devastated, Elsa hugs and mourns over her sister, who <a href="/wiki/Thaw_(weather)" title="Thaw (weather)">thaws</a> out, her heroism constituting "an act of true love". Realizing that love is the key to controlling her magic, Elsa ends the winter and gives Olaf his own snow flurry to survive the warmer climate. Both Hans and the Duke are arrested and exiled from the kingdom. Anna gives Kristoff a new sleigh, and the two kiss. Both sisters are reunited and Elsa promises never to lock the castle gates again.
</p><p>Sixty-five million years ago, an alien race known as the “Creators” used devices called Seeds to terraform Planet Earth, covering it with an alloy called Transformium. In the present day, <a href="/wiki/Geologist" title="Geologist">geologist</a> Darcy Tyril excavates the Transformium for K.S.I. Industries, which uses it to build man-made Transformer drones.
</p><p>Five years after <a href="/wiki/Transformers:_Dark_of_the_Moon" title="Transformers: Dark of the Moon">the Battle of Chicago</a>, humans have begun to view the Transformers as a threat, leading the U.S. government to terminate all human-Autobot joint programs. Although the public believes the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Autobots" title="Autobots">Autobots</a> have been granted sanctuary, they are being hunted by a rogue <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CIA" title="CIA">CIA</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Black_ops" title="Black ops">black ops</a> division known as Cemetery Wind, led by opportunistic government official Harold Attinger, who believes all Transformers should be exterminated regardless of their faction. They are aided by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lockdown_(Transformers)" title="Lockdown (Transformers)">Lockdown</a>, a Cybertronian <a href="/wiki/Bounty_hunter" title="Bounty hunter">bounty hunter</a> working for the Creators, promising to give Attinger a Seed if his division manages to capture <a href="/wiki/Optimus_Prime" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a>. Cemetery Wind locates <a href="/wiki/Ratchet_(Transformers)" title="Ratchet (Transformers)">Ratchet</a> in <a href="/wiki/Mexico_City" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a> and Lockdown kills him when he refuses to give up the whereabouts of Optimus Prime.
</p><p>Optimus, damaged in Mexico City and disguised as a rundown semi-truck, is discovered in an abandoned theater by Cade Yeager, a financially struggling Texan inventor, and brings him back to his farm. While his teenage daughter Tessa and business partner Lucas Flannery encourage him to turn Optimus over to the authorities after realizing what he really is, Cade instead fixes Optimus, hoping to understand his technology and unexpectedly revives him. Still skeptical of Optimus, Lucas calls Cemetery Wind, who attacks and destroys the farm, but Optimus and Tessa's boyfriend, Irish <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rally_car" title="Rally car">rally car</a> driver Shane Dyson, come to the family's aid. While on the run from Cemetery Wind and Lockdown, Lucas is killed by one of Lockdown's grenades. Escaping into the desert, they take refuge in an abandoned gas station. Later, Optimus scans a passing truck and turns into a Western Star 5700 Phantom Custom truck with the original red and blue paint with flames, and summons the surviving Autobots – <a href="/wiki/Bumblebee_(Transformers)" title="Bumblebee (Transformers)">Bumblebee</a>, who has assumed an alternate form, <a href="/wiki/Hound_(Transformers)" title="Hound (Transformers)">Hound</a>, <a href="/wiki/Drift_(Transformers)" title="Drift (Transformers)">Drift</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crosshairs_(Transformers)" title="Crosshairs (Transformers)">Crosshairs</a> – who have come to distrust humans due to Cemetery Wind constantly hunting them down. Using a CIA drone which he stole during the home invasion, Cade discovers K.S.I.'s involvement in the attacks on the Autobots. Optimus vows to personally kill Attinger for his actions against his brethren.
</p><p>Infiltrating K.S.I.'s headquarters in <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, Cade discovers the remains of Autobots and Decepticons are being melted down to make the drones. Joshua Joyce, the ambitious company CEO, is in league with Attinger to revolutionize global defenses and improve human society using the Seed. He has captured Brains and used him and data from <a href="/wiki/Megatron" title="Megatron">Megatron</a>'s head to create the drones and prototype Transformer soldiers <a href="/wiki/Galvatron" title="Galvatron">Galvatron</a> and Stinger. In a fit of rage, the Autobots storm the building, during which Bumblebee regains his original form by scanning a passing car, where they rescue Brains and destroy the laboratory, but they soon leave after Joshua announces that they are no longer needed. Attinger forces Joshua to deploy Galvatron and Stinger to attack the Autobots. During the battle, Galvatron's behavior becomes slightly erratic when it starts destroying vehicles, and when it fights Optimus it speaks to him. Lockdown then arrives and abducts Optimus while Galvatron and Stinger retreat; Tessa is inadvertently captured alongside Optimus in the midst of the chaos, leaving Cade and Shane devastated.
</p><p>While Lockdown's large prison spacecraft hovers over Chicago to hand over the Seed, Cade, Shane, and the Autobots use the opportunity to sneak on board and rescue Optimus and Tessa, hijacking a smaller ship containing a group of Autobots called the <a href="/wiki/Dinobots" title="Dinobots">Dinobots</a>, just before Lockdown leaves Earth. The Autobots reveal to Cade that "Galvatron" is in fact Megatron, who gave K.S.I. the data to build the Transformer drones so he could transfer his consciousness into the Galvatron drone, after they had unknowingly revived him. What's more, Galvatron is plotting to use the Seed and the K.S.I. drones to conquer the world by detonating the Seed in <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, as K.S.I. has brought it there to use it in the remote Mongolian desert to create vast amounts of usable Transformium. Cade informs Joshua of Megatron's presence, causing him to have a change of heart and agreeing to hand over the Seed with help from Darcy and his Chinese business associate Su Yueming. Meanwhile, Lockdown discovers Optimus' escape with the Dinobots, and returns to Earth to retrieve them. Optimus decides for the Autobots to no longer help the humans because of how they revived Megatron, but Cade explains to Optimus why he shouldn't lose faith in them. At the K.S.I. facility, during a disagreement between Joshua and Attinger over the Seed, Galvatron reactivates himself and promptly takes control of the K.S.I. drones, and a battle follows in Hong Kong's streets between Cade's group, the Autobots, Cemetery Wind, Galvatron, and his drones. During the fight, Optimus gains the alliance of the Dinobots, who become essential to the Autobots' victory while Bumblebee kills Stinger.
</p><p>Lockdown returns to capture Optimus and the Dinobots, using a large <a href="/wiki/Magnet" title="Magnet">magnet</a> in his ship that picks up and drops metal objects, causing destruction to the city. After disabling the magnet, Optimus fights Lockdown at an abandoned factory. In the ensuing duel, Optimus kills Attinger (who still angrily deems all Cybertronians aside from Lockdown as a threat) to save Cade, and avenging the deaths of his fellow Autobots, but this allows Lockdown to pin Optimus down by impaling his chest with his own sword. Cade, Bumblebee, Tessa, and Shane fight Lockdown, with Cade ending up fighting him one-on-one while Tessa and Shane use a tow truck to free Optimus, who kills Lockdown by cutting him in half before using one of his grenades to finish off the remaining drones. Galvatron retreats, vowing to return.
</p><p>As Lockdown's ship leaves Earth, Optimus tells the Autobots to protect the Yeagers (with Joshua offering to help the Yeagers build a new home) and lets the Dinobots go, before flying away into space with the Seed to hide it away, sending a message to the Creators that <a href="/wiki/Transformers:_The_Last_Knight" title="Transformers: The Last Knight">he is coming for them</a>.

Snoke questions Kylo's ability to deal with emotions relating to his father, Han Solo, who Kylo says means nothing to him.
</p><p>The <i>Falcon</i> crew determines BB-8's map is incomplete. Han explains that Luke attempted to rebuild the <a href="/wiki/Jedi" title="Jedi">Jedi Order</a> but exiled himself when an apprentice turned to the dark side, destroyed the temple, and slaughtered the other apprentices. The crew travels to the planet <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Takodana" title="Takodana">Takodana</a> and meets with cantina owner <a href="/wiki/Maz_Kanata" title="Maz Kanata">Maz Kanata</a>, who offers assistance getting <span class="nowrap">BB-8</span> to the Resistance.

She experiences disturbing visions and flees into the woods. Maz gives Finn the lightsaber for safekeeping.
</p><p>Starkiller Base destroys a few planets including the Republic capital and a portion of its fleet. The First Order attacks Takodana in search of <span class="nowrap">BB-8</span>. Han, Chewbacca, and Finn are saved by Resistance <a href="/wiki/X-wing_fighter" title="X-wing fighter">X-wing fighters</a> led by Poe, who is revealed to have survived the crash on Jakku. Leia arrives at Takodana with <span class="nowrap"><a href="/wiki/C-3PO" title="C-3PO">C-3PO</a></span> and reunites with Han and Chewbacca. Meanwhile, Kylo captures Rey and takes her to Starkiller Base, but she resists his mind-reading attempts. Discovering she can use the Force, Rey escapes by using a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jedi_mind_trick" title="Jedi mind trick">Jedi mind trick</a> on a nearby guard.
</p><p>At the Resistance base on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/D%27Qar" title="D'Qar">D'Qar</a>, BB-8 finds <a href="/wiki/R2-D2" title="R2-D2">R2-D2</a>, who has been inactive since Luke's disappearance. As Starkiller Base prepares to fire on D'Qar, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy it by attacking a critical facility. Using the <i>Falcon</i>, Han, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the facility, find Rey, and plant explosives. Han confronts Kylo, calling him by his birth name, Ben, and implores him to abandon the dark side. Kylo refuses and kills Han, enraging Chewbacca, who shoots Kylo and sets off the explosives, allowing the Resistance to attack and destroy the base.
</p><p>The injured Kylo pursues Finn and Rey to the surface. Kylo defeats Finn in a lightsaber duel, leaving him wounded. Rey takes the lightsaber and uses the Force to defeat Kylo before they are separated by a fissure as the planet begins to disintegrate. Snoke orders Hux to evacuate and bring Kylo to him to complete his training. Rey and Chewbacca escape with the unconscious Finn in the <i>Falcon</i>. On D'Qar, Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey mourn Han's death. <span class="nowrap">R2-D2</span> awakens and reveals the rest of the map, which Rey follows to the oceanic planet Ahch-To.

Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Helmut_Zemo" title="Helmut Zemo">Helmut Zemo</a> tracks down and kills Barnes' old Hydra handler, stealing a book containing the trigger words that activate Barnes' brainwashing. At a conference in <a href="/wiki/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> where the Accords are to be ratified, a bomb kills King <a href="/wiki/T%27Chaka" title="T'Chaka">T'Chaka</a> of Wakanda.

Rogers stops Barnes and sneaks him away. When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed "Winter Soldiers" are kept in <a href="/wiki/Suspended_animation" title="Suspended animation">cryogenic stasis</a>.

The rest of Rogers' team is captured and detained at the Raft prison, while Rhodes is partially paralyzed after being inadvertently shot down by Vision, and Romanoff goes into exile.
</p><p>Stark discovers evidence that Barnes was framed by Zemo and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes, unaware that they were secretly followed by T'Challa. They find that the other super-soldiers have been killed by Zemo, who then shows them footage that reveals that the automobile Barnes had intercepted in 1991 contained Stark's parents, whom Barnes subsequently killed. Enraged that Rogers kept this from him, Stark turns on them both, leading to an intense fight, in which Stark destroys Barnes' robotic arm, and Rogers disables <a href="/wiki/Iron_Man%27s_armor_in_other_media#Live_action" title="Iron Man's armor in other media">Stark's armor</a>.

Unbeknownst to Luke, Rey and Kylo communicate through the Force, puzzling the two enemies. As Rey and Kylo learn about each other, both have visions of themselves as future partners.
</p><p>R2-D2 persuades Luke to train Rey. After Kylo tells Rey what happened between him and Luke that caused him to choose the dark side, Luke confesses that he momentarily contemplated killing Kylo upon sensing that <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Leader_Snoke" title="Supreme Leader Snoke">Supreme Leader Snoke</a> was corrupting him, causing Kylo to destroy Luke's new Jedi Order in retaliation. Convinced that Kylo can be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To without Luke.

They infiltrate Snoke's ship, where all but BB-8 are captured by <a href="/wiki/Captain_Phasma" title="Captain Phasma">Captain Phasma</a>. Meanwhile, Rey lands on the ship, and Kylo brings her to Snoke, who says he facilitated the mental connection between her and Kylo as part of a plan to destroy Luke. Ordered to kill Rey, Kylo instead kills Snoke and defeats Snoke's guards alongside Rey. Rey believes that Kylo has returned to the light side of the Force, but he instead invites her to rule the galaxy with him. Refusing, she fights Kylo for possession of <a href="/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Anakin Skywalker</a>'s lightsaber, which splits in two.

Rey and Chewbacca draw the TIE fighters away with the <i>Falcon</i>, while Rose stops Finn from completing a suicide run against the enemy siege cannon, which subsequently penetrates the Resistance fortress.
</p><p>Luke appears and confronts the First Order to enable surviving Resistance members to escape. Kylo orders the First Order's forces to fire on Luke, to no effect. He then engages Luke in a lightsaber duel; upon striking Luke, Kylo realizes he has been fighting a Force projection of him. Rey uses the Force to help the Resistance escape on the <i>Falcon</i>. Luke, exhausted, becomes one with the Force and dies peacefully on Ahch-To. Rey and Leia sense his death, and Leia tells surviving rebels that the Resistance has all it needs to rise again.

</p><p>At the beginning of the film, Liu Peiqiang (<a href="/wiki/Wu_Jing_(actor)" title="Wu Jing (actor)">Wu Jing</a>), a Chinese astronaut, promises to his son Liu Qi (<a href="/wiki/Qu_Chuxiao" title="Qu Chuxiao">Qu Chuxiao</a>) of his eventual return before his mission to a space station that helps Earth navigate as it moves out of the Solar system, and hands guardianship of his son over to his father-in-law Han Zi'ang (<a href="/wiki/Ng_Man-tat" title="Ng Man-tat">Ng Man-tat</a>).
</p><p>Several years later, Liu Peiqiang's mission is about to end and he will soon return to Earth. To celebrate <a href="/wiki/Chinese_New_Year" title="Chinese New Year">Chinese New Year</a>, an adult Liu Qi brings adopted sister Han Duoduo (<a href="/wiki/Zhao_Jinmai" title="Zhao Jinmai">Zhao Jinmai</a>) on a trip to the surface in a truck they steal using Han Zi'ang's clearance as a trucker. They are arrested, and meet Tim (<a href="/wiki/Mike_Sui" title="Mike Sui">Mike Sui</a>) as well as Han Zi'ang who unsuccessfully tries to get them released.
</p><p>As Earth passes by <a href="/wiki/Jupiter" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>, it is captured by Jupiter's gravity, causing devastating <a href="/wiki/Earthquake" title="Earthquake">earthquakes</a> that disable many thrusters across the globe. The four escape amidst the chaos and attempt to make their way out using the stolen truck, but the truck is requisitioned for a rescue mission by the military; they are to transport an engine component to the damaged thruster in <a href="/wiki/Hangzhou" title="Hangzhou">Hangzhou</a>, supervised by soldiers led by Wang Lei (Li Guangjie). In the remnants of <a href="/wiki/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, they lose their vehicle, and while transporting the component up the ruins of <a href="/wiki/Shanghai_Tower" title="Shanghai Tower">a skyscraper</a> Han Zi'ang is killed. With news that the Hangzhou thruster was fully compromised and the city was completely destroyed, the group temporarily despair. They however find a new vehicle where the on-board engineer, Li Yiyi (Zhang Yichi), convinces them to transport an engine component to repair a larger planetary engine in <a href="/wiki/Sulawesi" title="Sulawesi">Sulawesi</a>.
</p><p>In space, Liu Peiqiang discovers that MOSS, the <a href="/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> commanding the space station, has directed it to escape rather than to assist the humans on Earth. He breaks out of forced hibernation and attempts to stop the spacecraft along with Russian <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cosmonaut" title="Cosmonaut">cosmonaut</a> Makarov, who is killed by the spacecraft's automated security measures. Liu Peiqiang arrives in the control room, but his clearances were revoked due to his undisciplinary acts and he can do little to override the escape process.
</p><p>Liu Qi's group arrive at Sulawesi to find that the engine was already fully restored. Globally, most of the planetary thrusters have been repaired as well. However, Earth has moved past Jupiter's <a href="/wiki/Roche_limit" title="Roche limit">Roche limit</a> and will be destroyed anyway, with the restored thrust unable to propel it away. The group despairs on learning this, but Liu Qi, inspired by recollection of his father's explanation of the thrusters' mechanics as a child, proposes to ignite Jupiter's <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen" title="Hydrogen">hydrogen</a>-abundant atmosphere to blow Earth away. Li Yiyi proposes to concentrate the Sulawesi engine's power to fire a beam high enough to ignite Jupiter. The group overcome various challenges, such as renewed <a href="/wiki/Aftershock" title="Aftershock">aftershock</a> tremors that injure several members, and are able to mostly reconfigure the engine to carry out the plan, however they are not able to push the <a href="/wiki/Firing_pin" title="Firing pin">firing pin</a> of the engine to ignite it.

Other rescue and repair parties arrive and the engine is fired up, but it falls short of being able to ignite the hydrogen. Liu Peiqiang decides to use the space station's engine itself to ignite Jupiter's hydrogen; after disabling MOSS using a fire started with <a href="/wiki/Vodka" title="Vodka">vodka</a> that Makarov smuggled on-board, he pilots the spacecraft into the cloud between Jupiter and Earth, sacrificing himself as the ignition succeeds.

</p><p><i>Variety</i> has been published since December 16, 1905,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-2"><a href="#cite_note-2">[2]</a></sup> when it was launched by Sime Silverman as a weekly periodical covering theater and <a href="/wiki/Vaudeville" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</a> with its headquarters in New York City.
</p><p>Sime was fired by <i><a href="/wiki/The_Morning_Telegraph" title="The Morning Telegraph">The Morning Telegraph</a></i> in 1905 for panning an act which had taken out an advert for $50,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-3"><a href="#cite_note-3">[3]</a></sup>  and said that it looked like he would have to start his own paper in order to be able to tell the truth. With a loan of $1,500 from his father-in-law, he launched <i>Variety</i> as publisher and editor.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-VarietyObit_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-VarietyObit-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>In addition to Sime's former employer <i>The Morning Telegraph</i>, other major competitors on launch were <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_New_York_Clipper" title="The New York Clipper">The New York Clipper</a></i> and the <i><a href="/wiki/New_York_Dramatic_Mirror" title="New York Dramatic Mirror">New York Dramatic Mirror</a></i>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-VarietyObit_4-1"><a href="#cite_note-VarietyObit-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>The original cover design, which is very similar to the current design, was sketched by Edgar M. Miller, a scenic painter, who refused payment.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-archive18_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-archive18-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>The front cover contained pictures of the original editorial staff, who were Alfred Greason, Epes W Sargeant (Chicot or Chic) and Joshua Lowe, as well as Sime.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Four-Letter_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-Four-Letter-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>The first issue contained a review by Sime's son Sidne, also known as Skigie (based on the childish lisping of his name) who was claimed to be the youngest critic in the world at seven years old.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 1922, Sime acquired <i>The New York Clipper</i> which had been reporting on the stage and other entertainment since 1853 and folded it two years later, merging some of its features into <i>Variety</i>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-InsideStuff_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-InsideStuff-8">[8]</a></sup>
</p><p>Also in 1922, Sime launched the <i>Times Square Daily</i>, which he referred to as "the world's worst daily" and soon scrapped.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-VarietyObit_4-2"><a href="#cite_note-VarietyObit-4">[4]</a></sup> During that period, <i>Variety</i> staffers worked on all three papers.

It replaced <i>Variety Bulletin</i> that was issued in Hollywood on Fridays. <i>Daily Variety</i> was initially published every day other than Sunday but mostly on Monday to Friday.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-10"><a href="#cite_note-10">[10]</a></sup> Ungar was editor until 1950, followed by Joe Schoenfeld (1950-1959) and then Thomas M.

</p><p>Sime Silverman had passed on the editorship of the <i>Weekly Variety</i> to <a href="/wiki/Abel_Green" title="Abel Green">Abel Green</a> as his replacement in 1931; he remained as publisher until his death in 1933 soon after launching <i>Daily Variety</i>. Green remained as editor from 1931 until his death in 1973.
</p><p>Sime's son Sidne succeeded him as publisher of both publications. Following his death from <a href="/wiki/Tuberculosis" title="Tuberculosis">tuberculosis</a> in 1950, his only son <a href="/wiki/Syd_Silverman" title="Syd Silverman">Syd Silverman</a>, was the sole heir to what was then Variety Inc. Young Syd's <a href="/wiki/Legal_guardian" title="Legal guardian">legal guardian</a> Harold Erichs oversaw Variety Inc. until 1956. After that date Syd Silverman
managed the company as publisher of both the <i>Weekly Variety</i> in New York and the <i>Daily Variety</i> in Hollywood, until the sale of both papers in 1987 to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cahners_Publishing" title="Cahners Publishing">Cahners Publishing</a> for $64 million.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-13"><a href="#cite_note-13">[13]</a></sup> He remained as publisher until 1990 when he was succeeded on <i>Weekly Variety</i> by Gerard A.

</p><p>In 1953, <a href="/wiki/Army_Archerd" title="Army Archerd">Army Archerd</a>'s "Just for Variety" column appeared on page two of <i>Daily Variety</i> and swiftly became popular in Hollywood. Archerd broke countless exclusive stories, reporting from film sets, announcing pending deals, giving news of star-related hospitalizations, marriages, and births. The column appeared daily for 52 years until September 1, 2005.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-15"><a href="#cite_note-15">[15]</a></sup>
</p><p>On December 7, 1988, the editor, Roger Watkins, proposed and oversaw the transition to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Color_print" title="Color print">four-color print</a>. Upon its launch, the new-look <i>Variety</i> measured one inch shorter with a washed-out color on the front. The old front-page box advertisement was replaced by a strip advertisement, along with the first photos published in <i>Variety</i> since Sime gave up using them in the old format in 1920: they depicted Sime, Abel and Syd.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-16"><a href="#cite_note-16">[16]</a></sup>
</p><p>For twenty years from 1989 its editor-in-chief was <a href="/wiki/Peter_Bart" title="Peter Bart">Peter Bart</a>, originally only of the weekly New York edition, with Michael Silverman (Syd's son) running the <i>Daily</i> in Hollywood.

</p><p>The film follows two <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/juxtaposed" title="wikt:juxtaposed">juxtaposed</a> families.

Meanwhile, young Ben Cameron idolizes a picture of Elsie Stoneman. During the Civil War, the young men from both families enlist in their respective armies for the war. The younger Stoneman and two of the Cameron brothers are killed in the war. Meanwhile, the Cameron women are rescued by Confederate soldiers who rout a black militia, after an attack on the Cameron home. Ben Cameron leads a heroic charge at the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Petersburg" title="Siege of Petersburg">Siege of Petersburg</a>, earning the nickname of "the Little Colonel", but he is also wounded and captured. He is then taken to a Union hospital in <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>
</p><p>During his stay at the hospital, he is told that he will be hanged. Also at the hospital, he meets Elsie Stoneman, whose picture he has been carrying; she is working there as a nurse.

During the election, in which Lynch is elected lieutenant governor, blacks are observed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ballot_box_stuffing" title="Ballot box stuffing">stuffing the ballot boxes</a>, while many whites are denied the vote. The newly elected, mostly black members of the South Carolina legislature are shown at their desks displaying inappropriate behavior, such as one member taking off his shoe and putting his feet up on his desk, and others drinking liquor and feasting on <a href="/wiki/Fried_chicken#Racial_stereotype" title="Fried chicken">fried chicken</a>.
</p><p>Meanwhile, inspired by observing white children pretending to be ghosts to scare black children, Ben fights back by forming the <a href="/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klan</a>. As a result, Elsie, out of loyalty to her father, breaks off her relationship with Ben. Later, Flora Cameron goes off alone into the woods to fetch water and is followed by Gus, a <a href="/wiki/Freedman" title="Freedman">freedman</a> and soldier who is now a captain. He confronts Flora and tells her that he desires to get married. Frightened, she flees into the forest, pursued by Gus. Trapped on a precipice, Flora warns Gus she will jump if he comes any closer. When he does, she leaps to her death. Having run through the forest looking for her, Ben has seen her jump; he holds her as she dies, then carries her body back to the Cameron home. In response, the Klan hunts down Gus, tries him, finds him guilty, and <a href="/wiki/Lynching" title="Lynching">lynches</a> him.
</p><p>Lynch then orders a crackdown on the Klan after discovering Gus's murder. He also secures the passing of legislation allowing <a href="/wiki/Interracial_marriage" title="Interracial marriage">mixed-race marriages</a>. Dr. Cameron is arrested for possessing Ben's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan_regalia_and_insignia" title="Ku Klux Klan regalia and insignia">Klan regalia</a>, now considered a crime punishable by death. He is rescued by Phil Stoneman and a few of his black servants. Together with Margaret Cameron, they flee. When their wagon breaks down, they make their way through the woods to a small hut that is home to two sympathetic former Union soldiers who agree to hide them.

</p><p>Congressman Stoneman leaves to avoid being connected with Lt. Gov. Lynch's crackdown. Elsie, learning of Dr. Cameron's arrest, goes to Lynch to plead for his release. Lynch, who had been lusting after Elsie, tries to force her to marry him, which causes her to faint. Stoneman returns, causing Elsie to be placed in another room.  At first, Stoneman is happy when Lynch tells him he wants to marry a white woman, but is then angered when Lynch tells him that it is Stoneman's daughter. Undercover Klansmen spies go to get help when they discover Elsie's plight after she breaks a window and cries out for help. Elsie falls unconscious again, and revives while gagged and being bound. The Klan, gathered together and with Ben leading them, rides in to gain control of the town. When news about Elsie reaches Ben, he and others go to her rescue. Elsie frees her mouth and screams for help. Lynch is captured. Victorious, the Klansmen celebrate in the streets. Meanwhile, Lynch's militia surrounds and attacks the hut where the Camerons are hiding. The Klansmen, with Ben at their head, race in to save them just in time. The next election day, blacks find a line of mounted and armed Klansmen just outside their homes, and are intimidated into not voting.
</p><p>The film concludes with a double wedding as Margaret Cameron marries Phil Stoneman and Elsie Stoneman marries Ben Cameron. The masses are shown oppressed by a giant warlike figure who gradually fades away. The scene shifts to another group finding peace under the image of <a href="/wiki/Jesus_in_Christianity" title="Jesus in Christianity">Jesus Christ</a>.

</p><p>At the Twelve Oaks party, Scarlett privately declares her feelings to Ashley, but he rebuffs her by responding that he and Melanie are more compatible. Scarlett is incensed when she discovers another guest, <a href="/wiki/Rhett_Butler" title="Rhett Butler">Rhett Butler</a>, has overheard their conversation. The barbecue is disrupted by the declaration of war and the men rush to enlist. As Scarlett watches Ashley kiss Melanie goodbye, Melanie's younger brother Charles proposes to her. Although she does not love him, Scarlett consents and they are married before he leaves to fight.

Afterwards, Scarlett calls upon Rhett to take her home to Tara with Melanie, her baby, and Prissy; he collects them in a horse and wagon, but once out of the city chooses to go off to fight, leaving Scarlett and the group to make their own way back to Tara. Upon her return home, Scarlett finds Tara deserted, except for her father, her sisters, and two former slaves: Mammy and Pork. Scarlett learns that her mother has just died of <a href="/wiki/Typhoid_fever" title="Typhoid fever">typhoid fever</a> and her father has become incompetent. With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett vows she will do anything for the survival of her family and herself.
</p><p>As the O'Haras work in the cotton fields, Scarlett's father is killed after he is thrown from his horse in an attempt to chase away a <a href="/wiki/Scalawag" title="Scalawag">scalawag</a> from his land. With the defeat of the Confederacy, Ashley also returns, but finds he is of little help at Tara. When Scarlett begs him to run away with her, he confesses his desire for her and kisses her passionately, but says he cannot leave Melanie. Unable to pay the taxes on Tara implemented by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reconstruction_Era" title="Reconstruction Era">Reconstructionists</a>, Scarlett dupes her younger sister Suellen's fiancé, the middle-aged and wealthy mill owner Frank Kennedy, into marrying her, by saying Suellen got tired of waiting and married another suitor.
</p><p>Frank, Ashley, Rhett and several other accomplices make a night raid on a <a href="/wiki/Shanty_town" title="Shanty town">shanty town</a> after Scarlett is attacked while driving through it alone, resulting in Frank's death. With Frank's funeral barely over, Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she accepts. They have a daughter whom Rhett names Bonnie Blue, but Scarlett, still pining for Ashley and chagrined at the perceived ruin of her figure, lets Rhett know that she wants no more children and that they will no longer share a bed.
</p><p>One day at Frank's mill, Scarlett and Ashley are seen embracing by Ashley's sister, India, and harboring an intense dislike of Scarlett she eagerly spreads rumors. Later that evening, Rhett, having heard the rumors, forces Scarlett to attend a birthday party for Ashley. Incapable of believing anything bad of her, Melanie stands by Scarlett's side so that all know that she believes the gossip to be false. After returning home from the party, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk, and they argue about Ashley. Rhett kisses Scarlett against her will, stating his intent to have sex with her that night, and carries the struggling Scarlett to the bedroom. The next day, Rhett apologizes for his behavior and offers Scarlett a divorce, which she rejects, saying that it would be a disgrace. When Rhett returns from an extended trip to London, Scarlett informs him that she is pregnant, but an argument ensues which results in her falling down a flight of stairs and suffering a <a href="/wiki/Miscarriage" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a>.

Her love of music and the mountains, her youthful enthusiasm and imagination, and her lack of discipline cause some concern among the nuns. The Mother Abbess, believing Maria would be happier outside the abbey, sends her to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children—Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. Liesl, the oldest, is won over after Maria protects her from discovery when she is nearly caught sneaking back into the house after meeting with Rolfe, a messenger boy she is in love with.
</p><p>While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children and takes them around Salzburg and the surrounding mountains, and teaches them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend, Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake that concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities, and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain orders her to return to the abbey. Just then he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. Afterwards, he apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay.
</p><p>Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes he enter them in the upcoming <a href="/wiki/Salzburg_Festival" title="Salzburg Festival">Salzburg Festival</a> but the suggestion is immediately rejected by the Captain as he is opposed to his children singing in public. He does agree, however, to organize a grand party at the villa. The night of the party, while guests in formal attire <a href="/wiki/Waltz" title="Waltz">waltz</a> in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional <i><a href="/wiki/L%C3%A4ndler" title="Ländler">Ländler</a></i> folk dance, he cuts in and dances with Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy while convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. Back at the abbey, when Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her life. After Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. The Captain's feelings for Maria, however, have not changed, and after breaking off his engagement the Captain marries Maria.
</p><p>While the Captain and Maria are on their honeymoon, Max enters the children in the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. When they learn that Austria has been annexed by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Third_Reich" title="Third Reich">Third Reich</a> in the <i><a href="/wiki/Anschluss" title="Anschluss">Anschluss</a></i>, the couple return to their home, where a telegram awaits informing the Captain that he must report to the German Naval base at <a href="/wiki/Bremerhaven" title="Bremerhaven">Bremerhaven</a> to accept a commission in the <a href="/wiki/Kriegsmarine" title="Kriegsmarine">German Navy</a>. Strongly opposed to the Nazis and the <i>Anschluss</i>, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately for <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. Many of the Von Trapps' friends are prepared to accept the new regime, including Rolfe, whom Liesl is devastated to see has joined the <a href="/wiki/Hitler_Youth" title="Hitler Youth">Hitler Youth</a>. That night, as the von Trapp family attempt to leave, they are stopped by a group of <a href="/wiki/Sturmabteilung" title="Sturmabteilung">Brownshirts</a> waiting outside the villa. When questioned by <i><a href="/wiki/Gauleiter" title="Gauleiter">Gauleiter</a></i> Hans Zeller, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven.
</p><p>Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slip away and seek shelter at the nearby abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Brownshirts soon arrive and search the abbey, and the family is discovered by Rolfe. Upon seeing Liesl, he hesitates raising the alarm long enough to allow the family time to flee, and the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When the soldiers attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start as two nuns have removed parts of the engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom.

Scarlett learns that <a href="/wiki/Ashley_Wilkes" title="Ashley Wilkes">Ashley Wilkes</a>—whom she secretly loves—is to be <a href="/wiki/Cousin_marriage" title="Cousin marriage">married to his cousin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Melanie_Hamilton" title="Melanie Hamilton">Melanie Hamilton</a>, and the engagement is to be announced the next day at a barbecue at Ashley's home, the nearby plantation <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Oaks" title="Twelve Oaks">Twelve Oaks</a>.
</p><p>At the Twelve Oaks party, Scarlett privately declares her feelings to Ashley, but he rebuffs her by responding that he and Melanie are more compatible. Scarlett is incensed when she discovers another guest, <a href="/wiki/Rhett_Butler" title="Rhett Butler">Rhett Butler</a>, has overheard their conversation. The barbecue is disrupted by the declaration of war and the men rush to enlist. As Scarlett watches Ashley kiss Melanie goodbye, Melanie's younger brother Charles proposes to her. Although she does not love him, Scarlett consents and they are married before he leaves to fight.
</p><p>Scarlett is widowed when Charles dies from a bout of <a href="/wiki/Pneumonia" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Measles" title="Measles">measles</a> while serving in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Confederate_Army" title="Confederate Army">Confederate Army</a>. Scarlett's mother sends her to the Hamilton home in <a href="/wiki/Atlanta" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> to cheer her up, although the O'Haras' outspoken house slave Mammy tells Scarlett she knows she is going there only to wait for Ashley's return. Scarlett, who should not attend a party while in mourning, attends a charity bazaar in Atlanta with Melanie where she meets Rhett again, now a <a href="/wiki/Blockade_runner" title="Blockade runner">blockade runner</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" title="Confederate States of America">Confederacy</a>. Celebrating a Confederate victory and to raise money for the Confederate war effort, gentlemen are invited to bid for ladies to dance with them. Rhett makes an inordinately large bid for Scarlett and, to the disapproval of the guests, she agrees to dance with him.
</p><p>The tide of war turns against the Confederacy after the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg" title="Battle of Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a> in which many of the men of Scarlett's town are killed. Scarlett makes another unsuccessful appeal to Ashley while he is visiting on Christmas <a href="/wiki/Furlough" title="Furlough">furlough</a>, although they do share a private and passionate kiss in the parlor on Christmas Day, just before he returns to war.
</p><p>Eight months later, as the city is besieged by the <a href="/wiki/Union_Army" title="Union Army">Union Army</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Atlanta_Campaign" title="Atlanta Campaign">Atlanta Campaign</a>, Scarlett and her young house slave Prissy must deliver Melanie's baby without medical assistance after she goes into premature labor. Afterwards, Scarlett calls upon Rhett to take her home to Tara with Melanie, her baby, and Prissy; he collects them in a horse and wagon, but once out of the city chooses to go off to fight, leaving Scarlett and the group to make their own way back to Tara. Upon her return home, Scarlett finds Tara deserted, except for her father, her sisters, and two former slaves: Mammy and Pork. Scarlett learns that her mother has just died of <a href="/wiki/Typhoid_fever" title="Typhoid fever">typhoid fever</a> and her father has become incompetent. With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett vows she will do anything for the survival of her family and herself.
</p><p>As the O'Haras work in the cotton fields, Scarlett's father is killed after he is thrown from his horse in an attempt to chase away a <a href="/wiki/Scalawag" title="Scalawag">scalawag</a> from his land. With the defeat of the Confederacy, Ashley also returns, but finds he is of little help at Tara. When Scarlett begs him to run away with her, he confesses his desire for her and kisses her passionately, but says he cannot leave Melanie. Unable to pay the taxes on Tara implemented by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reconstruction_Era" title="Reconstruction Era">Reconstructionists</a>, Scarlett dupes her younger sister Suellen's fiancé, the middle-aged and wealthy mill owner Frank Kennedy, into marrying her, by saying Suellen got tired of waiting and married another suitor.
</p><p>Frank, Ashley, Rhett and several other accomplices make a night raid on a <a href="/wiki/Shanty_town" title="Shanty town">shanty town</a> after Scarlett is attacked while driving through it alone, resulting in Frank's death. With Frank's funeral barely over, Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she accepts. They have a daughter whom Rhett names Bonnie Blue, but Scarlett, still pining for Ashley and chagrined at the perceived ruin of her figure, lets Rhett know that she wants no more children and that they will no longer share a bed.
</p><p>One day at Frank's mill, Scarlett and Ashley are seen embracing by Ashley's sister, India, and harboring an intense dislike of Scarlett she eagerly spreads rumors. Later that evening, Rhett, having heard the rumors, forces Scarlett to attend a birthday party for Ashley. Incapable of believing anything bad of her, Melanie stands by Scarlett's side so that all know that she believes the gossip to be false. After returning home from the party, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk, and they argue about Ashley. Rhett kisses Scarlett against her will, stating his intent to have sex with her that night, and carries the struggling Scarlett to the bedroom. The next day, Rhett apologizes for his behavior and offers Scarlett a divorce, which she rejects, saying that it would be a disgrace. When Rhett returns from an extended trip to London, Scarlett informs him that she is pregnant, but an argument ensues which results in her falling down a flight of stairs and suffering a <a href="/wiki/Miscarriage" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a>. As she is recovering, tragedy strikes when Bonnie dies while attempting to jump a fence with her pony.
</p><p>Scarlett and Rhett visit Melanie, who has suffered complications arising from a new pregnancy, on her deathbed. As Scarlett consoles Ashley, Rhett prepares to leave Atlanta. Having realized that it was he she truly loved all along, and not Ashley, Scarlett pleads with Rhett to stay, but Rhett rebuffs her and walks away into the morning fog, leaving her in tears on the staircase, vowing to one day win back his love.
</p><p>In 1945, at his daughter Connie's wedding, <a href="/wiki/Don_(honorific)" title="Don (honorific)">Don</a> Vito Corleone hears requests in his role as head of a New York crime family. His youngest son, <a href="/wiki/Michael_Corleone" title="Michael Corleone">Michael</a>, who was a <a href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps" title="United States Marine Corps">Marine</a> during <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, introduces his girlfriend, <a href="/wiki/Kay_Adams-Corleone" title="Kay Adams-Corleone">Kay Adams</a>, to his family at the reception. Johnny Fontane, a famous singer and Vito's <a href="/wiki/Godparent" title="Godparent">godson</a>, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his <a href="/wiki/Consigliere" title="Consigliere">consigliere</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tom_Hagen" title="Tom Hagen">Tom Hagen</a>, to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized <a href="/wiki/Stud_(animal)" title="Stud (animal)">stallion</a>.
</p><p>Shortly before Christmas, drug baron Virgil "The Turk" Sollozzo, backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, <a href="/wiki/Luca_Brasi" title="Luca Brasi">Luca Brasi</a>, to spy on them. Brasi is <a href="/wiki/Garrote" title="Garrote">garroted</a> during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later Sollozzo has Vito gunned down in the street, then kidnaps Hagen. With Corleone first-born <a href="/wiki/Sonny_Corleone" title="Sonny Corleone">Sonny</a> in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca "sleeps with the fishes." Vito survives, and at the hospital Michael thwarts another attempt on his father; Michael's jaw is broken by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NYPD" title="NYPD">NYPD</a> Captain Marc McCluskey, Sollozzo's unauthorized bodyguard. Sonny retaliates with a <a href="/wiki/Contract_killing" title="Contract killing">hit</a> on Bruno Tattaglia. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey: on the deception of settling the dispute, Michael arranges to meet them in a <a href="/wiki/The_Bronx" title="The Bronx">Bronx</a> restaurant. There, retrieving a planted handgun, he kills both men.
</p><p>Despite a clampdown by the authorities, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Five_Families_(The_Godfather)" title="Five Families (The Godfather)">Five Families</a> erupt in open warfare and Vito fears for his sons' safety. Michael takes refuge in <a href="/wiki/Sicily" title="Sicily">Sicily</a> and <a href="/wiki/Fredo_Corleone" title="Fredo Corleone">Fredo</a> is sheltered by <a href="/wiki/Moe_Greene" title="Moe Greene">Moe Greene</a> in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Las_Vegas_metropolitan_area" title="Las Vegas metropolitan area">Las Vegas</a>. Sonny attacks Carlo on the street for abusing Connie and threatens to kill him if it happens again. When it does, Sonny speeds to their home, but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and riddled with submachine gun fire. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries Apollonia Vitelli, but a car bomb intended for him takes her life.
</p><p>Devastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant Don <a href="/wiki/Emilio_Barzini" title="Emilio Barzini">Emilio Barzini</a>, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s, and with his father at the end of his career and his brother too weak, Michael takes the family reins.  He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Tom is not a "wartime consigliere"; Vito agrees Tom should "have no part in what will happen" in the coming battles with rival families. Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos. Michael is dismayed to see that Fredo has fallen under Greene's sway.
</p><p>In 1955, Vito suffers a fatal <a href="/wiki/Myocardial_infarction" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a>. At the funeral, <a href="/wiki/Salvatore_Tessio" title="Salvatore Tessio">Tessio</a>, a Corleone <a href="/wiki/Caporegime" title="Caporegime">capo</a>, asks Michael to meet with Don Barzini, signalling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the christening of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone assassins murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is executed for his treachery and Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini. A Corleone capo, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Clemenza" title="Peter Clemenza">Clemenza</a>, garrotes Carlo with a wire. Connie accuses Michael of the murder, telling Kay that Michael ordered all the killings. Kay is relieved when Michael finally denies it, but when the capos arrive, they address her husband as Don Corleone and she watches as they close the door on her.
</p><p>During a beach party at dusk on Amity Island, <a href="/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a>, a young woman, Chrissie Watkins, goes <a href="/wiki/Nude_swimming" title="Nude swimming">skinny dipping</a> in the ocean. While <a href="/wiki/Treading_water" title="Treading water">treading water</a>, she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner's ruling that the death was due to a <a href="/wiki/Shark_attack" title="Shark attack">shark attack</a> leads police chief Martin Brody to close the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly thereafter. A bounty is placed on the shark, prompting an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, and confirms her death was caused by a shark—an unusually large one.
</p><p>When local fishermen catch a <a href="/wiki/Tiger_shark" title="Tiger shark">tiger shark</a>, the mayor proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes that it is the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable <a href="/wiki/Great_white_shark" title="Great white shark">great white shark</a>'s tooth embedded in the submerged hull. He drops it in fright after encountering a partial corpse. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's claims that a huge great white shark is responsible for the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank in which the presence of a shark is simulated, the real shark enters a nearby <a href="/wiki/Estuary" title="Estuary">estuary</a>, killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces Vaughn to hire Quint.
</p><p>Quint, Brody, and Hooper set out on Quint's boat, the <i>Orca</i>, to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a <a href="/wiki/Chumming" title="Chumming">chum</a> line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating its length at 25 feet (7.6 m) and weight at 3 tons, harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.
</p><p>At nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars and Quint reveals that he survived the <a href="/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)" title="USS Indianapolis (CA-35)">USS <i>Indianapolis</i></a>. The shark returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull, and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he intentionally pushes the damaged engine past the safety limits and the overtaxed engine fails.
</p><p>With the <i>Orca</i> slowly sinking, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on <a href="/wiki/Scuba_set" title="Scuba set">scuba gear</a> and enters the water in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shark-proof_cage" title="Shark-proof cage">shark-proof cage</a>, intending to lethally inject the shark with <a href="/wiki/Strychnine" title="Strychnine">strychnine</a>, using a hypodermic spear. The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly and devours Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody jams a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion obliterates the shark. Hooper surfaces, and he and Brody paddle back to Amity Island clinging to the remaining barrels.

In a suburban neighborhood in the <a href="/wiki/San_Fernando_Valley" title="San Fernando Valley">San Fernando Valley</a>, a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves <a href="/wiki/Reese%27s_Pieces" title="Reese's Pieces">Reese's Pieces</a> candy to lure the alien to his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its <a href="/wiki/Planetary_system" title="Planetary system">planetary system</a> and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead <a href="/wiki/Chrysanthemum" title="Chrysanthemum">chrysanthemums</a>.

E.T. says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, as she presents him with the chrysanthemum that he had revived. Before boarding the spaceship, he embraces Elliott and tells him "I'll be right here", pointing his glowing finger to Elliott's forehead. He then picks up the chrysanthemum, boards the spaceship, and it takes off, leaving a rainbow in the sky as everyone watches it leave.
</p><p>Industrialist John Hammond and his <a href="/wiki/Biological_engineering" title="Biological engineering">bioengineering</a> company, InGen, have created a <a href="/wiki/Animal_theme_park" title="Animal theme park">theme park</a> featuring cloned dinosaurs and prehistoric plants, called Jurassic Park, on <a href="/wiki/Isla_Nublar" title="Isla Nublar">Isla Nublar</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rican</a> island. After a dinosaur handler is killed by a <i><a href="/wiki/Velociraptor" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a></i>, the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro, demand that experts visit the park and certify it is safe. To perform the inspection, Gennaro invites <a href="/wiki/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chaos_theory" title="Chaos theory">chaos theorist</a> Ian Malcolm, while Hammond invites <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paleontologist" title="Paleontologist">paleontologist</a> Dr. Alan Grant and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paleobotanist" title="Paleobotanist">paleobotanist</a> Dr. Ellie Sattler. Upon arrival, the group is shocked to see a live <i><a href="/wiki/Brachiosaurus" title="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a></i>, in addition to two more with a herd of <i><a href="/wiki/Parasaurolophus" title="Parasaurolophus">Parasaurolophus</a></i>.
</p><p>At the park's visitor center, the group learns the cloning was accomplished by extracting <a href="/wiki/Ancient_DNA" title="Ancient DNA">dinosaur DNA</a> from <a href="/wiki/Mosquito" title="Mosquito">mosquitoes</a> preserved in <a href="/wiki/Amber" title="Amber">amber</a>. DNA from <a href="/wiki/Frog" title="Frog">frogs</a> was used to fill in gaps in the dinosaurs' <a href="/wiki/Genome" title="Genome">genome</a>. To prevent breeding, all the dinosaurs were made female. Malcolm scoffs at the idea, saying it will inevitably break down. The group witnesses the hatching of a baby <i><a href="/wiki/Velociraptor" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a></i> and visits the raptor enclosure. At lunch, the group debates the <a href="/wiki/Ethics_of_cloning" title="Ethics of cloning">ethics of cloning</a> and the creation of the park. Malcolm gives a harsh warning about the implications of <a href="/wiki/Genetic_engineering" title="Genetic engineering">genetic engineering</a>.
</p><p>The group is joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Tim and Lex, for a tour of the park, while Hammond oversees the tour from the park's control room. The tour does not go as planned. Most of the dinosaurs fail to appear and the group encounters a sick <i><a href="/wiki/Triceratops" title="Triceratops">Triceratops</a></i>. It is cut short as a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" title="Tropical cyclone">tropical storm</a> approaches Isla Nublar. Most park employees leave for the mainland on a boat, while the visitors return to their electric tour vehicles. Sattler stays behind with the park's veterinarian to study the <i>Triceratops</i>.
</p><p>Jurassic Park's lead computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, has been bribed by Dodgson, a man working for Hammond's corporate rival, to steal fertilized dinosaur <a href="/wiki/Embryo" title="Embryo">embryos</a>. Nedry deactivates the park's security system to gain access to the embryo storage room and puts the stolen embryos inside a canister disguised as a shaving cream bottle. The power goes out, stalling the tour vehicles. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated, allowing the <i><a href="/wiki/Tyrannosaurus" title="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></i> to escape and attack the group. Grant and Hammond's grandchildren survive. The <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro. While taking the embryos to the island's dock, Nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes his <a href="/wiki/Jeep_Wrangler" title="Jeep Wrangler">Jeep Wrangler</a>, and is killed by a <i><a href="/wiki/Dilophosaurus" title="Dilophosaurus">Dilophosaurus</a></i>.
</p><p>Sattler helps the park's game warden, Robert Muldoon, search for survivors. They find only Malcolm before the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> returns. Grant, Tim, and Lex take shelter in a treetop. They later discover broken dinosaur egg shells. Grant concludes the dinosaurs have been breeding. This occurred because their frog DNA—<a href="/wiki/African_bullfrog" title="African bullfrog">West African bullfrogs</a> can change their sex in a single-sex environment, allowing the dinosaurs to do so as well, proving Malcolm right.
</p><p>Unable to decipher Nedry's code to reactivate the security system, Hammond and the park's chief engineer Ray Arnold reboot the park's system. The group shuts down the park's grid and retreats to an emergency bunker, while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When Arnold fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head to the shed. They discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining fences and released the <i>Velociraptors</i>. Muldoon distracts the raptors, while Sattler goes to turn the power back on, before being attacked by a raptor and discovering Arnold's severed arm. Muldoon is caught off guard and killed by the other two raptors.
</p><p>After encountering a <i><a href="/wiki/Brachiosaurus" title="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a></i> and narrowly escaping the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> during a <i><a href="/wiki/Gallimimus" title="Gallimimus">Gallimimus</a></i> stampede, Grant, Tim, and Lex reach the visitor center. Grant heads out to look for Sattler, leaving Tim (who was injured while scaling one of the fences) and Lex inside. They are pursued by the raptors in an industrial kitchen but escape and join Grant and Sattler. Lex restores full power from the control room, allowing them to call Hammond, who in turn calls for help. Grant, Tim, Lex, and Sattler are cornered by the raptors, but they escape when the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> suddenly appears and kills the raptors. Hammond arrives in a jeep with Malcolm, and the survivors board a helicopter to leave the island.
</p><p>In 1996, treasure hunter Brock Lovett and his team aboard the research vessel <i><a href="/wiki/Akademik_Mstislav_Keldysh" title="Akademik Mstislav Keldysh">Akademik Mstislav Keldysh</a></i> search the wreck of RMS <i>Titanic</i> for a necklace with a rare diamond, the <a href="/wiki/Heart_of_the_Ocean" title="Heart of the Ocean">Heart of the Ocean</a>. They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[Note 1]</a></sup> Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard <i>Keldysh</i> and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard <i>Titanic</i>.
</p><p>In 1912 <a href="/wiki/Southampton" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>, 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fiancé Cal Hockley, and her mother Ruth board the luxurious <i>Titanic</i>. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve their family's financial problems and retain their high-class persona. Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class.
</p><p>Aware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cal's bodyguard, Mr. Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with an iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.
</p><p>Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Lovejoy slips the necklace into Jack's pocket and he and Cal accuse him of theft. Jack is arrested, taken to the <a href="/wiki/Master-at-arms" title="Master-at-arms">master-at-arms</a>' office, and handcuffed to a pipe. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.
</p><p>With the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.
</p><p>After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for only one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of <a href="/wiki/Hypothermia" title="Hypothermia">hypothermia</a><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Carlson_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Carlson-9">[8]</a></sup> but Rose is saved.
</p><p>With Rose hiding from Cal en route, the <a href="/wiki/RMS_Carpathia" title="RMS Carpathia">RMS <i>Carpathia</i></a> takes the survivors to New York City where Rose gives her name as Rose Dawson.

</p><p>Back in the present, Lovett decides to abandon his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of <i>Keldysh</i>, Rose takes out the Heart of the Ocean – in her possession all along – and drops it into the sea over the wreck site.

</p><p>In 2154, humans have depleted <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>'s natural resources, leading to a severe energy crisis. The Resources Development Administration (RDA for short) mines for a valuable mineral — <a href="/wiki/Unobtainium" title="Unobtainium">unobtanium</a> — on Pandora, a densely forested <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Habitable_moon" title="Habitable moon">habitable moon</a> orbiting the <a href="/wiki/Gas_giant" title="Gas giant">gas giant</a> Polyphemus in the <a href="/wiki/Alpha_Centauri" title="Alpha Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a> star system.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Horwitz2009_11-1"><a href="#cite_note-Horwitz2009-11">[11]</a></sup> Pandora, whose atmosphere is poisonous to humans, is inhabited by the <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere#Naʼvi" title="Pandoran biosphere">Na'vi</a>, a species of 10-foot tall (3.0 m), blue-skinned, <a href="/wiki/Wisdom" title="Wisdom">sapient</a> humanoids<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> that live in harmony with nature and worship a <a href="/wiki/Mother_goddess" title="Mother goddess">mother goddess</a> named Eywa.
</p><p>To explore <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere" title="Pandoran biosphere">Pandora's biosphere</a>, scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called "avatars", operated by genetically matched humans; Jake Sully, a paraplegic former <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_Marine" title="United States Marine">Marine</a>, replaces his deceased identical twin brother as an operator of one. Dr. Grace Augustine, head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement but accepts his assignment as a bodyguard. While protecting the avatars of Grace and fellow scientist Dr. Norm Spellman as they collect biological data, Jake's avatar is attacked by a <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere#Fauna" title="Pandoran biosphere">thanator</a> and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Witnessing an auspicious sign, she takes him to her clan, whereupon Neytiri's mother Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Colonel" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's <a href="/wiki/Private_military_company" title="Private military company">private security force</a>, promises Jake that the company will restore his legs if he gathers information about the Na'vi and the clan's gathering place, a giant tree called Hometree,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Script25_36-0"><a href="#cite_note-Script25-36">[36]</a></sup> which stands above the richest deposit of unobtanium in the area. When Grace learns of this, she transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/outpost" title="wikt:outpost">outpost</a>. Over the following three months, Jake grows to sympathize with the natives. After Jake is initiated into the tribe, he and Neytiri choose each other as mates, and soon afterward, Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he attempts to disable a bulldozer that threatens to destroy a sacred Na'vi site. When Quaritch shows a video recording of Jake's attack on the bulldozer to Administrator Parker Selfridge,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Script8and15_37-0"><a href="#cite_note-Script8and15-37">[37]</a></sup> and another in which Jake admits that the Na'vi will never abandon Hometree, Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed.
</p><p>Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biological_neural_network" title="Biological neural network">biological neural network</a> native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate before commencing the attack. While trying to warn the Na'vi, Jake confesses to being a spy, and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Seeing this, Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, frees Jake and Grace and airlifts them to Grace's outpost, but during the escape Quaritch fires at them, hitting Grace.
</p><p>To regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fictional_universe_in_Avatar#The_Tree_of_Souls" title="Fictional universe in Avatar">Tree of Souls</a> and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can be completed. Supported by the new chief Tsu'tey, Jake speaks to unite the clan and tells them to gather all of the clans to battle against the RDA. Noticing the impending gathering, Quaritch organizes a <a href="/wiki/Preemptive_war" title="Preemptive war">pre-emptive strike</a> against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives. On the eve of battle, Jake prays to Eywa, via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na'vi.
</p><p>During the subsequent battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy; but are rescued when <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Characters_and_wildlife_in_Avatar#Fauna" title="Characters and wildlife in Avatar">Pandoran wildlife</a> unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch, wearing an <a href="/wiki/Mecha" title="Mecha">AMP suit</a>, escapes from his own damaged aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation.
</p><p>With the exceptions of Jake, Norm and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora and sent back to Earth, after which Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.

</p><p>Rocky Balboa (Sylvester Stallone) is a small-time boxer who seems to be going nowhere in life, as he works day-in and day-out as a collector for a <a href="/wiki/Loan_shark" title="Loan shark">loan shark</a> and fights in sleazy clubs for low pay rewards, for which Rocky is mocked and told that he's nothing but a 'bum,' especially by gym trainer <a href="/wiki/Mickey_Goldmill" title="Mickey Goldmill">Mickey Goldmill</a> (<a href="/wiki/Burgess_Meredith" title="Burgess Meredith">Burgess Meredith</a>). At the same time, Rocky successfully courts Adrian Pennino (<a href="/wiki/Talia_Shire" title="Talia Shire">Talia Shire</a>), a painfully shy woman with an alcoholic brother, Paulie (<a href="/wiki/Burt_Young" title="Burt Young">Burt Young</a>). But when the world <a href="/wiki/Heavyweight" title="Heavyweight">heavyweight</a> champion boxer <a href="/wiki/Apollo_Creed" title="Apollo Creed">Apollo Creed</a> (<a href="/wiki/Carl_Weathers" title="Carl Weathers">Carl Weathers</a>) chooses Rocky at random as his opponent in a title fight, Rocky realizes he now has the chance to prove that he's not worthless. With Adrian's support and Mickey becoming his trainer and manager, Rocky fights for his self-respect.
</p><p>Soon after proving himself, even with a split decision loss to Apollo Creed, Rocky expects the good life to follow. He marries Adrian and begins spending the money he earned from the match. But after he fails at both endorsements and a series of low wage jobs, Rocky realizes the only way he can survive is to begin boxing again. Creed on the other hand, faces criticism from fans to overcome the fight. As a result, he publicly taunts Rocky into a rematch, for which Rocky trains once again with Mickey. In the fifteenth round, Rocky knocks Creed to the ground, falling to the canvas himself in the process. Both fighters struggle to get to their feet, but only Rocky is successful. For the first time, Rocky is declared the World Heavyweight Champion; even Apollo shows respect for him as he regains his support from fans for doing a fair fight.
</p><p>After winning the heavyweight title, Rocky takes advantage of his newfound wealth and fame, appearing in multiple advertisements and television programs, and relishing his new celebrity status. After defending the title multiple times, he is prepared to retire, but the number one contender, <a href="/wiki/Clubber_Lang" title="Clubber Lang">James "Clubber" Lang</a> (played by <a href="/wiki/Mr._T" title="Mr. T">Mr. T</a>), challenges Rocky publicly. Rocky, after dealing with Mickey's heart attack before the fight, is overpowered by the stronger, hungrier Lang and is knocked out in the second round. Mickey passes away after the fight, and former rival Apollo Creed steps in, training Rocky to fight in Creed's old style (in his old Los Angeles gym) and to use more guile and skill. In the rematch, Rocky outboxes Lang, tiring the stronger fighter out and eventually knocking him out in the third round. After the fight, Apollo calls in his "favor" for training Rocky, which is a one-on-one match between the two of them with no cameras, no media, just man vs. man in the gym. The film ends as they each throw their first punch.
</p><p>After winning back his title from Clubber Lang, Rocky continues to live the good life, now that he and Apollo are good friends. However, a new fighter from the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">USSR</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ivan_Drago" title="Ivan Drago">Ivan Drago</a> (played by <a href="/wiki/Dolph_Lundgren" title="Dolph Lundgren">Dolph Lundgren</a>), has emerged and challenges Rocky to an exhibition match. Apollo fights instead, and the beating he takes from Drago ends with Apollo dying in Rocky's arms in the ring as Drago coldly watches. To avenge Apollo, Rocky challenges Drago to a match, which is to be held on Christmas Day in Moscow. In a montage replete with symbolism, Rocky is shown training in a remote cabin in Siberia with the help of Creed's old trainer Duke, his brother-in-law Paulie, and eventually Adrian, doing exercises such as chopping wood, lifting rocks, running in the snow and climbing a mountain, while Drago is seen in an advanced training facility running on treadmills, utilizing weightlifting machines and injecting steroids to boost his strength. During the fight, Rocky takes the worst beating of his life but refuses to fall. He eventually wins over the foreign crowd with his display of courage and determination, and he knocks Drago out with seconds left in the final round.
</p><p>In the aftermath of his fight with Ivan Drago, Rocky Balboa is diagnosed with brain damage and is forced to retire from the ring. Additionally, the Balboa fortune is all gone due to an unscrupulous accountant. Rocky's family returns to their old neighborhood and Adrian returns to the pet store she used to work at, while (in a subplot) Rocky (Robert) Jr. (played by Sylvester Stallone's <a href="/wiki/Sage_Stallone" title="Sage Stallone">real son Sage</a>) deals with bullying at his school and Rocky re-opens Mickey's old gym. While training other boxers, Rocky meets a young, hungry boxer named <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tommy_Gunn_(character)" title="Tommy Gunn (character)">Tommy Gunn</a> (played by real-life fighter <a href="/wiki/Tommy_Morrison" title="Tommy Morrison">Tommy Morrison</a>) and begins training him which results in a strained relationship with Robert. Unfortunately, as Tommy begins his rise to fame under Rocky's wing, a sleazy fight promoter named George Washington Duke convinces Tommy that Rocky is holding him back and Tommy leaves Rocky for Duke. After Tommy wins the heavyweight title, he makes a short speech thanking Duke, and is met with jeers and the familiar chant of "Rocky" from the crowd. Seething from this insult, as well as being called by publicists as "Rocky's robot" and being told that he's "no Rocky Balboa," Tommy decides to seek out his former mentor for a final showdown. Rocky starts to walk away from the public challenge, but Paulie decides to let Tommy have a piece of his mind about how Tommy has treated Rocky, and Tommy proceeds to punch Paulie. Rocky then challenges Tommy outside and the two proceed in a violent bare-knuckle street brawl, which Rocky wins. Rocky then proceeds to punch Duke for harassing him. In the end, Rocky and Robert reconcile as they run up the steps as father and son.
</p><p>In <i>Rocky Balboa</i>, sixteen years have passed since his final fight with his former protégé, Tommy "The Machine" Gunn. Long retired, Rocky Balboa still staggers around an ever-changing world; his son is grown and distant, Paulie is working back at the meat plant, and Rocky's wife Adrian has died. Rocky has opened a restaurant named after his wife, which he stocks with mementos of his prime as he tells his old fight stories to customers. But when a computer simulated fight on <a href="/wiki/ESPN" title="ESPN">ESPN</a> depicting a bout between a young Rocky Balboa and the current champion, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mason_Dixon_(Rocky_Balboa_character)" title="Mason Dixon (Rocky Balboa character)">Mason Dixon</a> (<a href="/wiki/Antonio_Tarver" title="Antonio Tarver">Antonio Tarver</a>) reignites interest in the faded boxer, Rocky discovers he has not lost his fighting spirit and considers an opportunity to prove himself in the ring again. Rocky almost wins the fight but loses in a split decision just like the first film (in an alternate ending Rocky won). Rocky is last seen visiting his wife's grave saying, "Yo Adrian, we did it."
</p><p>Adonis "Donnie" Johnson (<a href="/wiki/Michael_B._Jordan" title="Michael B. Jordan">Michael B. Jordan</a>), the illegitimate son of the late former heavyweight champion Apollo Creed, tracks down Rocky Balboa at Adrian's and asks Rocky to become his trainer. Rocky is reluctant, but eventually agrees. When word gets out that Donnie is Creed's illegitimate son, the handlers of world light heavyweight champion "Pretty" Ricky Conlan, who is forced into retirement by an impending prison term, offer to make Donnie the latter's final challenger—provided that he change his name to Adonis Creed. Donnie balks at first, wanting to forge his own legacy. However, he eventually agrees. While helping Donnie train, Rocky learns he has <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non-Hodgkin%27s_lymphoma" title="Non-Hodgkin's lymphoma">non-Hodgkin's lymphoma</a>. He is initially unwilling to undergo <a href="/wiki/Chemotherapy" title="Chemotherapy">chemotherapy</a> because it wasn't enough to save Adrian from ovarian cancer. Donnie persuades Rocky to seek treatment and continues training while Rocky recovers. In a battle reminiscent of Apollo and Rocky's first fight, Donnie fights Conlan in Conlan's hometown of <a href="/wiki/Liverpool" title="Liverpool">Liverpool</a> and surprises almost everyone by going the distance and pushing Conlan to his limit. Conlan wins by split decision, but Donnie wins the respect of Conlan and the crowd, with Conlan calling Donnie the future of the light heavyweight division. Returning to Philadelphia, Donnie and a recovering Rocky both make their way up <a href="/wiki/Rocky_Steps" title="Rocky Steps">the Philadelphia Museum steps</a> and look at the skyline.
</p><p>Three years after losing the fight to "Pretty" Ricky Conlan, Adonis Johnson Creed wins the World Heavyweight Championship and proposes to his girlfriend, Bianca Taylor (<a href="/wiki/Tessa_Thompson" title="Tessa Thompson">Tessa Thompson</a>). Meanwhile, three decades since the death of Apollo Creed and his loss to Rocky Balboa, Ivan Drago is training his son, Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu), to reclaim their honor by having Viktor publicly challenge Adonis for the World Heavyweight Title. Rocky is reluctant to train Adonis, fearing Adonis will meet the same fate as his father, but Adonis accepts the challenge without him and is badly injured during the fight. Because of Viktor's disqualification, Adonis retains the title. Viktor demands a rematch, while he is being promoted by his father's supporters who originally abandoned Drago, including Drago's ex-wife, Ludmilla (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Brigette_Nielsen" title="Brigette Nielsen">Brigette Nielsen</a>). Viktor is subjected to vicious training sessions in preparation for the rematch. Rocky comes to Adonis' aid and decides to train him in the Southern California desert, with a different tactic for Adonis to take in Viktor's powerful punches. The rematch is set in Moscow, and Adonis is able to take Viktor's powerful punches, while leaving Viktor exhausted. Viktor's supporters and his mother leave during the fight with doubt that Viktor will win. Drago seeing his son taking Adonis’ punches without fighting back, throws in the towel and assures his son that he is more important to him and that he will not abandon him like he was. While Rocky later reunites with his son, Robert (<a href="/wiki/Milo_Ventimiglia" title="Milo Ventimiglia">Milo Ventimiglia</a>) and meets his grandson, Adonis brings Bianca and their newborn baby girl to his late father's grave, making peace with his late father and honoring his legacy.

</p><p>Crossovers often occur in an official capacity in order for the <a href="/wiki/Intellectual_property" title="Intellectual property">intellectual property</a> rights holders to reap the financial reward of combining two or more popular, established properties. In other cases, the crossover can serve to introduce a new concept derivative of an older one.
</p><p>Crossovers generally occur between properties owned by a single holder, but they can, more rarely, involve properties from different holders, provided that the inherent legal obstacles can be overcome. They may also involve using characters that have passed into the <a href="/wiki/Public_domain" title="Public domain">public domain</a> with those concurrently under <a href="/wiki/Copyright" title="Copyright">copyright protection</a>.
</p><p>A crossover story may try to explain its own reason for the crossover, such as characters being neighbors (notable examples being the casts from <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Golden_Girls" title="Golden Girls">Golden Girls</a></i> and <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Empty_Nest_(TV_series)" title="Empty Nest (TV series)">Empty Nest</a></i>) or meeting via <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dimensional_rift" title="Dimensional rift">dimensional rift</a> or similar phenomenon (a common explanation for <a href="/wiki/Science_fiction" title="Science fiction">science fiction</a> properties that have different owners). Some crossovers are not explained at all. Others are absurd or simply impossible within the fictional setting, and have to be ignored by the series' respective <a href="/wiki/Continuity_(fiction)" title="Continuity (fiction)">continuities</a>. Still others intentionally make the relations between two or more fictional universes confusing, as with <i><a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Futurama" title="Futurama">Futurama</a></i>, where each show is fiction in the other.
</p><p>Crossovers of multiple characters owned by one company or <a href="/wiki/Publishing" title="Publishing">published</a> by one <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Publisher" title="Publisher">publisher</a>, have been used to set an established continuity, where characters can frequently meet within one setting. This is especially true of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Comic_book_publisher" title="Comic book publisher">comic book publishers</a>, as different characters in various <a href="/wiki/Marvel_Comics" title="Marvel Comics">Marvel</a>, <a href="/wiki/DC_Comics" title="DC Comics">DC</a> or <a href="/wiki/Valiant_Comics" title="Valiant Comics">Valiant</a> <a href="/wiki/Comic_book" title="Comic book">comic books</a> frequently interact with one another since they live in a "<a href="/wiki/Shared_universe" title="Shared universe">shared universe</a>". For example, in the Marvel Comics universe, <a href="/wiki/Spider-Man" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a> has frequent dealings with another Marvel hero, <a href="/wiki/Daredevil_(Marvel_Comics_character)" title="Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)">Daredevil</a>, just as in the DC Comics Universe, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Flash_(Barry_Allen)" title="The Flash (Barry Allen)">Flash</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Green_Lantern_(Hal_Jordan)" title="Green Lantern (Hal Jordan)">Green Lantern</a> often collaborate. In comic book terminology, these "guest star" roles are common enough that they are generally not considered crossovers; rather, this short-term collaboration to fight crime is called a <a href="/wiki/Team-up" title="Team-up">team-up</a>. A crossover in comic book terms only occurs when a story spans more than one title.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources. (October 2014)">citation needed</span></a></i>]</sup> This has led to "crossover events", in which major occurrences are shown as affecting most or all of the stories in the shared universe.
</p><p>The earliest such crossover event was <a href="/wiki/Gardner_Fox" title="Gardner Fox">Gardner Fox</a>'s <i>Zatanna's Search</i>, which took place in <i><a href="/wiki/Hawkman" title="Hawkman">Hawkman</a></i> #4 (October/November 1964), <i><a href="/wiki/Detective_Comics" title="Detective Comics">Detective Comics</a></i> #336 (February 1965), <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Atom" title="The Atom">The Atom</a></i> #19 (June/July 1965), <i><a href="/wiki/Green_Lantern" title="Green Lantern">Green Lantern</a></i> #42 (January 1966), <i>Detective Comics</i> #355 (September 1966), and <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Justice_League_of_America" title="Justice League of America">Justice League of America</a></i> #51 (February 1967). This story dealt with <a href="/wiki/Zatanna" title="Zatanna">Zatanna</a> attempting to reconnect with her father, <a href="/wiki/Zatara" title="Zatara">Zatara</a>, and seeking the aid of Hawkman, Batman, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Robin_(comics)" title="Robin (comics)">Robin</a>, the Atom, Green Lantern, and <a href="/wiki/Elongated_Man" title="Elongated Man">Elongated Man</a> along the way.
</p><p>The first major crossover event was spearheaded by the Marvel Editor-in-Chief at the time, <a href="/wiki/Jim_Shooter" title="Jim Shooter">Jim Shooter</a>. As a way to further toy sales he devised the <i><a href="/wiki/Secret_Wars" title="Secret Wars">Secret Wars</a></i> crossover, which brought all the major Marvel heroes into a 12-issue miniseries to battle a common threat. After the threat was dealt with, they all returned to their regular titles. <i>Secret Wars</i> was hailed as both a critical and commercial success, largely because the events of the crossover had lasting effects on the characters (such as the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Spider-Man" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a>'s black suit which would later become the villain <a href="/wiki/Venom_(Marvel_Comics_character)" title="Venom (Marvel Comics character)">Venom</a>). <a href="/wiki/Jim_Shooter" title="Jim Shooter">Jim Shooter</a> later perfected his crossover technique at <a href="/wiki/Valiant_Comics" title="Valiant Comics">Valiant Comics</a> with the <i><a href="/wiki/Unity_(comics)" title="Unity (comics)">Unity</a></i> event. <i>Unity</i> brought all the Valiant characters together to defeat <a href="/wiki/Mothergod" title="Mothergod">Mothergod</a>, but was told within the existing Valiant Comics titles (and two bookend special issues). Readers were not obliged to buy all 18 chapters as the story was coherent when reading just one title, but far more layered when all were read. Like <i>Secret Wars</i>, the <i>Unity</i> crossover had lasting effects on the Valiant universe; most notably the introduction of <a href="/wiki/Turok" title="Turok">Turok</a>, the birth of <a href="/wiki/Magnus,_Robot_Fighter" title="Magnus, Robot Fighter">Magnus, Robot Fighter</a> and the death of a major Valiant hero.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Dark_Horse_Comics" title="Dark Horse Comics">Dark Horse Comics</a>'s <i>Aliens Versus Predator</i> comic book franchise was a success that continued into many video games, two movies and even an <i>Aliens Versus Predator Versus The Terminator</i> comic.
</p><p>The comic crossovers from <a href="/wiki/Raj_Comics" title="Raj Comics">Raj Comics</a> are very famous in India, in which the super heroes meet to fight a common enemy. Many of these crossovers have occurred between <a href="/wiki/Nagraj" title="Nagraj">Nagraj</a> and <a href="/wiki/Super_Commando_Dhruva" title="Super Commando Dhruva">Super Commando Dhruva</a>. In <i>Kohram</i>, all the heroes in Raj Universe meet to finish <i>Haru</i>, an extremely powerful enemy.
</p><p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Webcomics" title="Webcomics">Webcomics</a> creators sometimes produce crossovers; one of the first was a two-week sequence between <a href="/wiki/Christopher_Baldwin" title="Christopher Baldwin">Christopher Baldwin</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Bruno_(webcomic)" title="Bruno (webcomic)">Bruno</a></i> and Peter Zale's <i><a href="/wiki/Helen,_Sweetheart_of_the_Internet" title="Helen, Sweetheart of the Internet">Helen, Sweetheart of the Internet</a></i> in 1998.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-1"><a href="#cite_note-1">[1]</a></sup>
</p><p>In 2013, Archie Comics released a 12-part crossover of <a href="/wiki/Capcom" title="Capcom">Capcom</a> character <a href="/wiki/Mega_Man" title="Mega Man">Mega Man</a> and <a href="/wiki/Sega" title="Sega">Sega</a> character <a href="/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(character)" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (character)">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> called "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Worlds_Collide_(Archie_Comics)" title="Worlds Collide (Archie Comics)">Worlds Collide</a>". Taking place in issues of the <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_(comics)" title="Sonic the Hedgehog (comics)">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sonic_Universe" title="Sonic Universe">Sonic Universe</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Mega_Man_(Archie_Comics)" title="Mega Man (Archie Comics)">Mega Man</a></i> comic series from Archie, the crossover involved <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dr._Eggman" title="Dr. Eggman">Dr. Eggman</a> and <a href="/wiki/Dr._Wily" title="Dr. Wily">Dr. Wily</a> forming an alliance to take over both their universes and destroy their respective nemeses. Sonic and Mega Man were briefly tricked into fighting each other, but later joined forces and teamed up with other heroes to battle the doctors' forces, which included virtually every Robot Master introduced in the <i>Mega Man</i> games. The popularity of this crossover and the books involved led to a second crossover in 2015 entitled "Worlds Unite", which not only reunited Sonic and Mega Man but also featured comics-exclusive characters from both of their books, the <i><a href="/wiki/Mega_Man_X" title="Mega Man X">Mega Man X</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Sonic_Boom_(TV_series)" title="Sonic Boom (TV series)">Sonic Boom</a></i> spinoff franchises and various other SEGA and Capcom franchises. This crossover was enabled by the conclusion of the first crossover, which saw a reboot to the Sonic books as their universe was drastically rewritten. Aftereffects of this included the Genesis Portals, gateways connecting worlds that would be exploited by <i>Mega Man X</i> villain Sigma and his minions, forcing a reunion between Sonic and Mega Man and an alliance between heroes of the various franchises involved. "Worlds Unite" spans not only the three series featured in the first crossover, but also includes the <i>Sonic Boom</i> comic series, which entered publication between the two crossovers.
</p><p>There are also <a href="/wiki/Intercompany_crossover" title="Intercompany crossover">intercompany crossovers</a>, where characters owned by two different companies meet, such as those from DC and Marvel.
</p><p>Cartoon crossovers are not uncommon, and most of them – like comics or live-action TV shows – will often feature characters owned by the same company or network. One example is <a href="/wiki/Cartoon_Network" title="Cartoon Network">Cartoon Network</a>'s <i>The Grim Adventures of the Kids Next Door</i>. It features five crossovers – <i><a href="/wiki/Ed,_Edd_n_Eddy" title="Ed, Edd n Eddy">Ed, Edd n Eddy</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Codename:_Kids_Next_Door" title="Codename: Kids Next Door">Codename: Kids Next Door</a></i>, <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Grim_Adventures_of_Billy_and_Mandy" title="The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy">The Grim Adventures of Billy and Mandy</a></i>, a reference to <i><a href="/wiki/The_Powerpuff_Girls" title="The Powerpuff Girls">The Powerpuff Girls</a></i> and a quote from <i><a href="/wiki/Scooby-Doo" title="Scooby-Doo">Scooby-Doo</a></i>, which are all licensed Cartoon Network series. The cast of <i><a href="/wiki/Ben_10:_Ultimate_Alien" title="Ben 10: Ultimate Alien">Ben 10: Ultimate Alien</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Generator_Rex" title="Generator Rex">Generator Rex</a></i> team up in <i><a href="/wiki/Ben_10/Generator_Rex:_Heroes_United" title="Ben 10/Generator Rex: Heroes United">Ben 10/Generator Rex: Heroes United</a></i>. Similarly, characters from <i><a href="/wiki/Uncle_Grandpa" title="Uncle Grandpa">Uncle Grandpa</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Steven_Universe" title="Steven Universe">Steven Universe</a></i> appeared in a crossover episode "Say Uncle". The same occurred with <i><a href="/wiki/The_Powerpuff_Girls_(2016_TV_series)" title="The Powerpuff Girls (2016 TV series)">The Powerpuff Girls</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Teen_Titans_Go!_(TV_series)" title="Teen Titans Go! (TV series)">Teen Titans Go!</a></i> in an episode called "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/TTG_v_PPG" title="TTG v PPG">TTG v PPG</a>". <i><a href="/wiki/OK_K.O.!_Let%27s_Be_Heroes" title="OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes">OK K.O.! Let's Be Heroes</a></i> did a crossover episode called "Crossover Nexus" to celebrate 25 years of Cartoon Network where the lead character joined forces with Ben 10, Garnet from Steven Universe and Raven from Teen Titans. Most of the last episodes of the <i><a href="/wiki/Lilo_%26_Stitch:_The_Series" title="Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series">Lilo &amp; Stitch: The Series</a></i> (a spinoff of the film <i><a href="/wiki/Lilo_%26_Stitch" title="Lilo &amp; Stitch">Lilo &amp; Stitch</a></i>) had crossovers with various other <a href="/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" title="The Walt Disney Company">Disney</a> cartoons, including <i><a href="/wiki/The_Proud_Family" title="The Proud Family">The Proud Family</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Kim_Possible" title="Kim Possible">Kim Possible</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Recess_(TV_series)" title="Recess (TV series)">Recess</a></i>, and <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/American_Dragon_Jake_Long" title="American Dragon Jake Long">American Dragon Jake Long</a></i>. The <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jimmy_Timmy_Power_Hour" title="Jimmy Timmy Power Hour">Jimmy Timmy Power Hour</a></i> trilogy is another example, in which Jimmy Neutron and Timmy Turner switch universes. The Disney TV series <i><a href="/wiki/Hercules_(1998_TV_series)" title="Hercules (1998 TV series)">Hercules</a></i>, based on the <a href="/wiki/Hercules_(1997_film)" title="Hercules (1997 film)">1997 film of the same name</a>, had an episode titled "<a href="/wiki/Hercules_and_the_Arabian_Night" title="Hercules and the Arabian Night">Hercules and the Arabian Night</a>" that had a crossover between the characters of the TV series and film and with the characters of the Disney film <i><a href="/wiki/Aladdin_(1992_Disney_film)" title="Aladdin (1992 Disney film)">Aladdin</a></i>, in which Hades and Jafar each try to get rid of each other's enemies (Hades would try to defeat Aladdin while Jafar would try to defeat Hercules). Another crossover is <i><a href="/wiki/Rugrats_Go_Wild" title="Rugrats Go Wild">Rugrats Go Wild</a></i> in which the <a href="/wiki/Rugrats" title="Rugrats">Rugrats</a> are stranded on an island where <a href="/wiki/The_Wild_Thornberrys" title="The Wild Thornberrys">The Wild Thornberrys</a> were at the time. In <a href="/wiki/Dexter%27s_Laboratory" title="Dexter's Laboratory">Dexter's Laboratory</a> "Dial M for Monkey" "Huntor" who tries to hunt Monkey is himself hunted; "Huntor" later makes a cameo crossover in <a href="/wiki/Samurai_Jack" title="Samurai Jack">Samurai Jack</a>'s "Jack vs Mad Jack." 
During the 1970s and 1980s, crossovers were particularly common among the <a href="/wiki/Hanna-Barbera" title="Hanna-Barbera">Hanna-Barbera</a> properties. Some of the earliest examples happened on <i><a href="/wiki/The_New_Scooby-Doo_Movies" title="The New Scooby-Doo Movies">The New Scooby-Doo Movies</a></i>, which featured appearances by characters from <i><a href="/wiki/Harlem_Globetrotters_(TV_series)" title="Harlem Globetrotters (TV series)">Harlem Globetrotters</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Josie_and_the_Pussycats_(TV_series)" title="Josie and the Pussycats (TV series)">Josie and the Pussycats</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Jeannie_(TV_series)" title="Jeannie (TV series)">Jeannie</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Speed_Buggy" title="Speed Buggy">Speed Buggy</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Adventures_of_Batman" title="The Adventures of Batman">Batman and Robin</a></i>, and <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Addams_Family_(1973_animated_series)" title="The Addams Family (1973 animated series)">The Addams Family</a></i>. Later, the <i><a href="/wiki/Hanna-Barbera_Superstars_10" title="Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10">Hanna-Barbera Superstars 10</a></i> set of movies involved several crossovers, including such combinations as <i><a href="/wiki/The_Jetsons_Meet_the_Flintstones" title="The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones">The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones</a></i>. This was taken to an extreme in the 1977–79 series <i><a href="/wiki/Laff-A-Lympics" title="Laff-A-Lympics">Laff-A-Lympics</a>,</i> which was essentially a gathering of the Hanna-Barbera characters for a regular series.
</p><p>Crossovers are not necessarily composed of characters under common ownership. Two of the most notable cartoon crossovers consisted of characters from different companies. Disney's movie <i><a href="/wiki/Who_Framed_Roger_Rabbit" title="Who Framed Roger Rabbit">Who Framed Roger Rabbit</a></i> had characters from various companies, most notably Disney and <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros." title="Warner Bros.">Warner Bros.</a> <a href="/wiki/Daffy_Duck" title="Daffy Duck">Daffy Duck</a> and <a href="/wiki/Donald_Duck" title="Donald Duck">Donald Duck</a> made a simultaneous appearance in one scene, in which the two of them exchanged blows during a piano duet. Later in the movie, <a href="/wiki/Mickey_Mouse" title="Mickey Mouse">Mickey Mouse</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bugs_Bunny" title="Bugs Bunny">Bugs Bunny</a> were shown parachuting together (to keep things from getting too iffy legally, Mickey and Bugs' lines were written so that each of them said exactly the same number of words in the movie).<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

In addition to this a couple of characters from <i>Eddsworld</i> make appearances in some <i>Crash Zoom</i> episodes such as "Orcs and Dorks". Another example is <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Death_Battle" title="Death Battle">Death Battle</a></i> which is a show where two guys (Whiz and Boomstick) put two characters from different franchises together to battle each other. These characters range from television, movie, video game, or comic franchises.

</p><p>The first film crossover in a series of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Universal_Studios" title="Universal Studios">Universal Studios</a> monster films was <i><a href="/wiki/Frankenstein_Meets_the_Wolf_Man" title="Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man">Frankenstein Meets the Wolf Man</a></i>, in 1943.

</p><p>After the comics publishing house <a href="/wiki/Marvel_Comics" title="Marvel Comics">Marvel Comics</a> ventured into <a href="/wiki/Marvel_Studios#Production" title="Marvel Studios">movie production</a>, they set of to produce solitary films with popular superheroes from the Avengers team, with characters from upcoming films making cameo appearances in films starring another superhero, while it all lead to the crossover movie <i><a href="/wiki/The_Avengers_(2012_film)" title="The Avengers (2012 film)">The Avengers</a></i> (2012). The same process was repeated for <i><a href="/wiki/Avengers:_Age_of_Ultron" title="Avengers: Age of Ultron">Avengers: Age of Ultron</a></i> (2015) and <i><a href="/wiki/Avengers:_Infinity_War" title="Avengers: Infinity War">Avengers: Infinity War</a></i> (2018) and all the movies together form the crossover film series referred to as the <a href="/wiki/Marvel_Cinematic_Universe" title="Marvel Cinematic Universe">Marvel Cinematic Universe</a>.

</p><p>There have been numerous crossovers in Japanese cinema. The boom of <a href="/wiki/Kaiju" title="Kaiju">kaiju</a> films saw a lot of crossovers produced at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Toho_Studios" title="Toho Studios">Toho Studios</a>, with some of the monsters forming teams in numerous movies, much like the Marvel movie franchise. <a href="/wiki/Godzilla" title="Godzilla">Godzilla</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mothra" title="Mothra">Mothra</a> and <a href="/wiki/Rodan" title="Rodan">Rodan</a> (Radon) each first appeared in standalone films before being set against each other or even teaming up against stronger enemies. Their first encounter was in 1964, first in <i><a href="/wiki/Mothra_vs._Godzilla" title="Mothra vs. Godzilla">Mothra vs. Godzilla</a></i> and a few months later of all three in <i><a href="/wiki/Ghidorah,_the_Three-Headed_Monster" title="Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster">Ghidorah, the Three-Headed Monster</a></i>. In 1962 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Toho_Studios" title="Toho Studios">Toho</a> released <i><a href="/wiki/King_Kong_vs._Godzilla" title="King Kong vs. Godzilla">King Kong vs. Godzilla</a></i>. The long running <a href="/wiki/Zatoichi" title="Zatoichi">Zatoichi</a> series sees <a href="/wiki/Shintaro_Katsu" title="Shintaro Katsu">Shintaro Katsu</a>'s blind master swordsman face of with <a href="/wiki/Toshiro_Mifune" title="Toshiro Mifune">Toshiro Mifune</a> in his iconic role in <i><a href="/wiki/Zatoichi_Meets_Yojimbo" title="Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo">Zatoichi Meets Yojimbo</a></i> (1970) and also features a unique cross-Asian project <i><a href="/wiki/Zatoichi_and_the_One-Armed_Swordsman" title="Zatoichi and the One-Armed Swordsman">Zatoichi and the One-Armed Swordsman</a></i> (1971). This coproduction sees <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jimmy_Wang_(actor)" title="Jimmy Wang (actor)">Jimmy Wang</a> reprise his famous part of the <i><a href="/wiki/One-Armed_Swordsman" title="One-Armed Swordsman">One-Armed Swordsman</a></i> while featuring two different endings for both the Japanese and Hong Kong audiences.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Literature" title="Literature">literature</a>, some authors also engage in crossovers by including characters from different novels they have written in one. <a href="/wiki/Kim_Newman" title="Kim Newman">Kim Newman</a> is another author who frequently uses this device, as does <a href="/wiki/Stephen_King" title="Stephen King">Stephen King</a>. The works of <a href="/wiki/James_Branch_Cabell" title="James Branch Cabell">James Branch Cabell</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/J.D._Salinger" title="J.D. Salinger">J.D. Salinger</a>, <a href="/wiki/William_Faulkner" title="William Faulkner">William Faulkner</a>, <a href="/wiki/Margaret_Laurence" title="Margaret Laurence">Margaret Laurence</a>, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Pynchon" title="Thomas Pynchon">Thomas Pynchon</a>, <a href="/wiki/Kurt_Vonnegut" title="Kurt Vonnegut">Kurt Vonnegut</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mordecai_Richler" title="Mordecai Richler">Mordecai Richler</a>, <a href="/wiki/Edgar_Rice_Burroughs" title="Edgar Rice Burroughs">Edgar Rice Burroughs</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Robert_Heinlein" title="Robert Heinlein">Robert Heinlein</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Isaac_Asimov" title="Isaac Asimov">Isaac Asimov</a> also cross over with each other, linking different characters and settings together over a number of different works. Author <a href="/wiki/Rick_Riordan" title="Rick Riordan">Rick Riordan</a> publishes multiple book series featuring gods of ancient civilizations in the modern day, which have had two crossovers and three references to other series. The first popular crossover in literature was the 1885 Mark Twain novel, <i><a href="/wiki/Adventures_of_Huckleberry_Finn" title="Adventures of Huckleberry Finn">The Adventures of Huckleberry Finn</a></i>, which had an important guest appearance by <a href="/wiki/Tom_Sawyer" title="Tom Sawyer">Tom Sawyer</a>.
</p><p>Brazilian writer <a href="/wiki/Monteiro_Lobato" title="Monteiro Lobato">Monteiro Lobato</a> also created solid and imaginative crossovers, using elements and characters from Brazilian folklore such as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cuca_(folklore)" title="Cuca (folklore)">Cuca</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saci_(Brazilian_folklore)" title="Saci (Brazilian folklore)">Saci</a>, from <a href="/wiki/Greek_mythology" title="Greek mythology">Greek mythology</a>, from the <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arabian_Nights" title="Arabian Nights">Arabian Nights</a></i>, from fairy tales such as Grimm's "<a href="/wiki/Snow_White" title="Snow White">Snow White</a>", Western literature such as <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pan" title="Peter Pan">Peter Pan</a>, cartoons such as <i><a href="/wiki/Popeye" title="Popeye">Popeye</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Felix_the_Cat" title="Felix the Cat">Felix the Cat</a></i>, and Western films.
</p><p>It is also common for authors to 'crossover' characters who have passed into the public domain, and thus do not require copyright or royalty payments for their use in other works. <i><a href="/wiki/The_League_of_Extraordinary_Gentlemen" title="The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</a></i> by <a href="/wiki/Alan_Moore" title="Alan Moore">Alan Moore</a> and <a href="/wiki/Kevin_O%27Neill_(comics)" title="Kevin O'Neill (comics)">Kevin O'Neill</a> is another example of this, as all of the main characters and most of the secondary / background characters are fictional characters whose copyright has expired, and all are characters of different authors and creators brought together within one massive extended universe. Many of the works of <a href="/wiki/Philip_Jos%C3%A9_Farmer" title="Philip José Farmer">Philip José Farmer</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Wold_Newton_family" title="Wold Newton family">Wold Newton family</a> sequences (which has also been explored and developed by other authors) also utilize and interweave numerous otherwise unrelated fictional characters into a rich family history by speculating familial connections between them (such as a blood-relationship between <a href="/wiki/Sherlock_Holmes" title="Sherlock Holmes">Sherlock Holmes</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tarzan" title="Tarzan">Tarzan</a>). <a href="/wiki/Roger_Zelazny" title="Roger Zelazny">Roger Zelazny</a>'s novel <i><a href="/wiki/A_Night_in_the_Lonesome_October" title="A Night in the Lonesome October">A Night in the Lonesome October</a></i> combines Sherlock Holmes, Doctor Frankenstein, Jack the Ripper, and the Cthulhu Mythos, although he never specifically identifies them as such ("The Count", "The Good Doctor", "Jack", etc.).
</p><p>Occasionally, authors will include into crossovers classic fictional characters whose copyright is still held by the original authors (or at least their estates), but who are nevertheless considered iconic or 'mythic' enough to be recognised from a few character traits or descriptions without being directly named (thus not requiring royalties payments to be made to the copyright holder). A prominent example occurs within <i><a href="/wiki/The_League_of_Extraordinary_Gentlemen,_Volume_One" title="The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen, Volume One</a></i>, wherein a character who is clearly intended in appearance and description by other characters to be Dr. <a href="/wiki/Fu_Manchu" title="Fu Manchu">Fu Manchu</a> appears as a significant villain; however, as this character was not in the public domain at the time of writing and the rights still held by the estate of his creator <a href="/wiki/Sax_Rohmer" title="Sax Rohmer">Sax Rohmer</a>, he is not directly named as such in the work and is only referred to as 'the Devil Doctor'. Something similar occurs in <i><a href="/wiki/The_League_of_Extraordinary_Gentlemen:_Black_Dossier" title="The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier">The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen: Black Dossier</a></i>, wherein a character named "<a href="/wiki/List_of_The_League_of_Extraordinary_Gentlemen_characters#Jimmy_Bond" title="List of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen characters">Jimmy</a>" is clearly intended to be <a href="/wiki/Ian_Fleming" title="Ian Fleming">Ian Fleming</a>'s character <a href="/wiki/James_Bond" title="James Bond">James Bond</a>, though here he is satirized as being an inept and unfavorable antagonist, likely to parody <a href="/wiki/Sean_Connery" title="Sean Connery">Sean Connery</a>'s appearance in the 2003 <a href="/wiki/The_League_of_Extraordinary_Gentlemen_(film)" title="The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen (film)">film adaptation</a>. Another example in <i>The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen</i> is when a character is named to be the Anti-Christ, yet, despite never being named, is shown to be an evil <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter" title="Harry Potter">Harry Potter</a>.
</p><p>The TV show <i><a href="/wiki/Once_Upon_a_Time_(TV_series)" title="Once Upon a Time (TV series)">Once Upon a Time</a></i> is set in a world in which all <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fairy_tales" title="Fairy tales">fairy tales</a> coexist, including <a href="/wiki/Snow_White" title="Snow White">Snow White</a>, <a href="/wiki/Little_Red_Riding_Hood" title="Little Red Riding Hood">Little Red Riding Hood</a>, and even <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alice_in_Wonderland" title="Alice in Wonderland">Alice in Wonderland</a>. (As a production of <a href="/wiki/The_Walt_Disney_Company" title="The Walt Disney Company">The Walt Disney Company</a>, copyrighted elements from that company's productions have appeared in <i>Once Upon a Time</i>.) The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shrek_(film_series)" title="Shrek (film series)"><i>Shrek</i></a> film series is built on the same concept, and even includes references to then-copyrighted elements like <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pan" title="Peter Pan">Peter Pan</a> (often in the form of <a href="/wiki/Satire" title="Satire">satire</a>).
</p><p>One of the earlier instances of crossovers in TV productions outside the US is the episode <i>Unter Brüdern</i> (1990), which was produced by <a href="/wiki/Westdeutscher_Rundfunk" title="Westdeutscher Rundfunk">WDR</a> and <a href="/wiki/Deutscher_Fernsehfunk" title="Deutscher Fernsehfunk">DFF</a> as a crossover between the <a href="/wiki/West_Germany" title="West Germany">West German</a> crime series <i><a href="/wiki/Tatort" title="Tatort">Tatort</a></i> and the <a href="/wiki/East_Germany" title="East Germany">East German</a> crime series <i><a href="/wiki/Polizeiruf_110" title="Polizeiruf 110">Polizeiruf 110</a></i>. Their respective popular heroes <a href="/wiki/Horst_Schimanski" title="Horst Schimanski">Horst Schimanski</a> and Peter Fuchs join forces to solve a case in the turmoil of the time after the <a href="/wiki/Berlin_Wall#The_fall" title="Berlin Wall">fall of the Berlin Wall</a>. The episode was produced during the short transition period between the fall of the Berlin Wall and the <a href="/wiki/German_reunification" title="German reunification">reunification of Germany</a>.
</p><p>Crossovers involving principals can also occur when the characters have no prior relationship, but are related by time period, locale or profession. The <i>Law and Order</i> series, for example, afford a commonality of setting and profession which lends itself to crossovers, both within the franchise and in a wider universe. <i>Law &amp; Order: SVU</i> has crossed over several times with <i>Chicago P.D.</i> and <i>Chicago Fire</i>, as well as sharing a common character with <i>Homicide: Life on the Street</i>. <i>NCIS</i> has crossed over with <i>NCIS: Los Angeles</i>, <i>NCIS: New Orleans</i> and <i>JAG</i>, while <i>NCIS: Los Angeles</i> has crossed over with both <i>Scorpion</i> and <i>Hawaii Five-0</i>. Following the cancellation of the <a href="/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> <a href="/wiki/Soap_opera" title="Soap opera">soap opera</a> <i><a href="/wiki/One_Life_to_Live" title="One Life to Live">One Life to Live</a></i> and its high rated finale, several characters crossed over into the network's remaining soap opera <i><a href="/wiki/General_Hospital" title="General Hospital">General Hospital</a></i>, remaining in the same timeline as their former show.
</p><p>The <i>CSI</i> franchise is another common example of the crossover phenomena, with the original series crossing over with <i>CSI: Miami</i>, <i>CSI: Cyber</i>, <i>CSI: NY</i> and <i>Without a Trace</i>. <i>CSI: NY</i> crossed over with fellow CBS series <i>Cold Case</i>, and <a href="/wiki/Ted_Danson" title="Ted Danson">Ted Danson</a> appeared as a regular on both <i>CSI</i> and <i>Cyber</i>. Similarly, <i><a href="/wiki/Family_Guy" title="Family Guy">Family Guy</a></i> has crossed over with <i><a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i>, while <i>The Simpsons</i> has crossed over with <i><a href="/wiki/The_X-Files" title="The X-Files">The X-Files</a></i>. <i>The X-Files</i> has in turn crossed over with <i><a href="/wiki/Millennium_(TV_series)" title="Millennium (TV series)">Millennium</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Homicide:_Life_on_the_Street" title="Homicide: Life on the Street">Homicide: Life on the Street</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Lone_Gunmen" title="The Lone Gunmen">The Lone Gunmen</a></i> and <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cops_(TV_series)" title="Cops (TV series)">Cops</a></i>. A proposed crossover with <i><a href="/wiki/The_West_Wing" title="The West Wing">The West Wing</a></i> was planned, but was never produced.
</p><p>There was also an ongoing use of crossover characters between <i><a href="/wiki/The_Beverly_Hillbillies" title="The Beverly Hillbillies">The Beverly Hillbillies</a></i>,  <i><a href="/wiki/Green_Acres" title="Green Acres">Green Acres</a></i>, and  <i><a href="/wiki/Petticoat_Junction" title="Petticoat Junction">Petticoat Junction</a></i>.
</p><p>Though most common on shows of the same <a href="/wiki/Production_company" title="Production company">production company</a> (see, for example, "<a href="/wiki/Hurricane_Saturday" title="Hurricane Saturday">Hurricane Saturday</a>"), crossovers have also occurred because shows share the same distributor or <a href="/wiki/Television_network" title="Television network">television network</a>. A notable example of this kind of link is that between <i><a href="/wiki/Murder,_She_Wrote" title="Murder, She Wrote">Murder, She Wrote</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Magnum,_P.I." title="Magnum, P.I.">Magnum, P.I.</a></i> These shows were made by different companies, but owned by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Universal_Studios" title="Universal Studios">Universal Studios</a> and broadcast on <a href="/wiki/CBS" title="CBS">CBS</a>. Another case is that of <i><a href="/wiki/Mad_About_You" title="Mad About You">Mad About You</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Friends" title="Friends">Friends</a></i>, which share the character of <a href="/wiki/List_of_Friends_characters#Ursula_Pamela_Buffay" title="List of Friends characters">Ursula Buffay</a>. Neither show shares any production or distribution commonality, but rather an actress (<a href="/wiki/Lisa_Kudrow" title="Lisa Kudrow">Lisa Kudrow</a>), a setting (<a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>) and a schedule (<i>Friends</i> initially followed <i>Mad About You</i> on <a href="/wiki/NBC" title="NBC">NBC</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Must_See_TV" title="Must See TV">Thursday night schedule</a>).
</p><p><i>Mad About You</i> and <i>Friends</i> share another type of "network crossover". On rare occasions, networks have chosen to theme an entire night's programming around a crossover "event". In one case, a New York City <a href="/wiki/Power_outage" title="Power outage">blackout</a> caused by <a href="/wiki/Paul_Reiser" title="Paul Reiser">Paul Reiser</a>'s character on <i>Mad About You</i> was experienced by the characters on <i>Friends</i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Madman_of_the_People" title="Madman of the People">Madman of the People</a></i>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> Such "event nights" can also be linked by a single character's quest across multiple shows on the same evening. <a href="/wiki/American_Broadcasting_Company" title="American Broadcasting Company">ABC</a> attempted this kind of "event night" crossover with its <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/TGIF_(ABC)" title="TGIF (ABC)">Friday night programming</a> during the 1997 season. There, they proposed that the title character of <i><a href="/wiki/Sabrina_the_Teenage_Witch_(1996_TV_series)" title="Sabrina the Teenage Witch (1996 TV series)">Sabrina the Teenage Witch</a></i> should chase her cat, <a href="/wiki/Salem_Saberhagen" title="Salem Saberhagen">Salem</a>, through <i><a href="/wiki/Boy_Meets_World" title="Boy Meets World">Boy Meets World</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/You_Wish_(TV_series)" title="You Wish (TV series)">You Wish</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Teen_Angel_(1997_TV_series)" title="Teen Angel (1997 TV series)">Teen Angel</a></i> because it had run away with a "time ball" that was displacing each show through time.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>ABC also attempted a "crossover" when four of its sitcoms (<i><a href="/wiki/Grace_Under_Fire" title="Grace Under Fire">Grace Under Fire</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Ellen_(TV_series)" title="Ellen (TV series)">Ellen</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/The_Drew_Carey_Show" title="The Drew Carey Show">The Drew Carey Show</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Coach_(TV_series)" title="Coach (TV series)">Coach</a></i>) all went to <a href="/wiki/Las_Vegas" title="Las Vegas">Las Vegas</a> during the 1996–1997 season.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Dan_Schneider_(TV_producer)" title="Dan Schneider (TV producer)">Dan Schneider</a> used the show he was producing <i><a href="/wiki/Zoey_101" title="Zoey 101">Zoey 101</a></i> to promote his new show <i><a href="/wiki/ICarly" title="ICarly">iCarly</a></i> by making characters from <i>Zoey 101</i> go to <i>ICarly.com</i> or use the song "Leave It All To Me", the iCarly theme song, as a ringtone.

</p><p>On other occasions, crossovers between established shows can occur without a network or production commonality, but simply because there is some narrative rationale for the crossover. The appearance of detective <a href="/wiki/John_Munch" title="John Munch">John Munch</a> (from NBC's <i><a href="/wiki/Homicide:_Life_on_the_Street" title="Homicide: Life on the Street">Homicide: Life on the Street</a></i>) on Fox's <i>The X-Files</i> happened merely because the episode revolved around a crime scene in Baltimore, a logical place for characters on <i>The X-Files</i> to have encountered Munch. Munch would also appear on the TV series <i><a href="/wiki/Law_%26_Order" title="Law &amp; Order">Law &amp; Order</a></i> on NBC in which it had one episode which began on that series in New York City and concluded in Baltimore on <i>Homicide: Life on the Street</i>. Later, when <i>Homicide</i> went off the air in 1999, Detective Munch ends up leaving Baltimore to move to New York, and becoming a permanent character (as New York City Detective Munch) on NBC's <i><a href="/wiki/Law_%26_Order:_Special_Victims_Unit" title="Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit">Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit</a></i> until October 2013.

</p><p>Another type of crossover involves characters from an off the air series resurfacing in a newer series. This occurred in a 2010 episode of the <a href="/wiki/Nickelodeon" title="Nickelodeon">Nickelodeon</a> sitcom <i><a href="/wiki/ICarly" title="ICarly">iCarly</a></i>; the episode "iStart a Fan War" featured recurring characters from two Nickelodeon series: <i><a href="/wiki/Drake_%26_Josh" title="Drake &amp; Josh">Drake &amp; Josh</a></i> characters Eric Blonowitz, Craig Ramirez, Gavin Mitchell, and <i><a href="/wiki/Zoey_101" title="Zoey 101">Zoey 101</a></i> character Stacey Dillsen. A crossover between <i><a href="/wiki/Victorious" title="Victorious">Victorious</a></i> and <i>Drake &amp; Josh</i> also occurred, with Helen DuBois, portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Yvette_Nicole_Brown" title="Yvette Nicole Brown">Yvette Nicole Brown</a> making an appearance. An episode titled "<a href="/wiki/IParty_with_Victorious" title="IParty with Victorious">iParty with Victorious</a>" was a crossover between <i>iCarly</i> and <i>Victorious</i>. This means all 4 shows exist in the same universe. However, in <i>Who Did It to Trina</i>, Tori referred to <i>Drake and Josh</i> as a TV show, making it seem as if the previous appearance was an actor of a character from a show within a show. Also in multiple episodes from <i>iCarly</i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Sam_%26_Cat" title="Sam &amp; Cat">Sam &amp; Cat</a></i> (a crossover/spin-off of <i>iCarly</i> And <i>Victorious</i>) one can see <i>Drake and Josh</i> and <i>Zoey 101</i> in TV guides, when the characters are watching TV. Carly and Spencer were heard watching it in the <i>iCarly</i> episode <i>iGet Pranky</i> and Carly is seen looking at it briefly in <i>iToe Fat Cakes</i> and you can see the character Megan from <i>Drake and Josh</i> (also portrayed by <a href="/wiki/Miranda_Cosgrove" title="Miranda Cosgrove">Miranda Cosgrove</a>) and Sam is seen changing the channel to it in <i>#FavoriteShow</i> an episode from <i>Sam &amp; Cat</i>, making the universe between each of the shows confusing.

</p><p>Crossovers can take the form of a promotional <a href="/wiki/Cameo_appearance" title="Cameo appearance">cameo appearance</a>, used to draw attention to another work of fiction, with little rational explanation in the context of the hosting show's narrative. When not clearly presented as parody, this is frequently scorned by fans as blatant commercialism. A notable example of this is <i><a href="/wiki/The_Simpsons" title="The Simpsons">The Simpsons</a></i> episode <i><a href="/wiki/A_Star_Is_Burns" title="A Star Is Burns">A Star Is Burns</a></i>, in which the character of Jay Sherman (from <i><a href="/wiki/The_Critic" title="The Critic">The Critic</a></i>) appeared. It originally aired on March 5, 1995 on FOX right before <i>The Critic</i> began its second season, its first season having aired on ABC. This episode was largely condemned by fans of <i>The Simpsons</i> as existing to promote <i>The Critic</i>, an animated series considered inferior by comparison.

However, it is not considered a spin-off because Dan Tanna  was introduced in the pilot that was aired as an <i>ABC TV Movie of the Week</i> on the evening of Tuesday, April 25, 1978. The crossover was simply used to reintroduce the Dan Tanna character and to promote the debut of <i>Vega$</i> as an ongoing series.

Promotional cameos from the two daytime dramas, primetime shows (including primetime airings), and sports properties are common.  <i>Price</i> has been used to promote anniversaries of CBS daytime dramas, the <i>NCIS</i> franchise, the three reality shows, and <a href="/wiki/NFL_on_CBS" title="NFL on CBS">CBS Sports' coverage of the NFL</a>.
</p><p>In its simplest and most common form, a television crossover involves a starring character on a parent show appearing on a <a href="/wiki/Spin-off_(media)" title="Spin-off (media)">spin-off</a> or vice versa because of established character relationships. An obvious example of this type of crossover occurred when <a href="/wiki/Cliff_Huxtable" title="Cliff Huxtable">Cliff Huxtable</a> of <i><a href="/wiki/The_Cosby_Show" title="The Cosby Show">The Cosby Show</a></i> visited his daughter, <a href="/wiki/Denise_Huxtable" title="Denise Huxtable">Denise</a>, on <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/A_Different_World_(TV_series)" title="A Different World (TV series)">A Different World</a></i>. Another example of this is <i><a href="/wiki/The_Bionic_Woman" title="The Bionic Woman">The Bionic Woman</a></i>, which was a spin-off from <i><a href="/wiki/The_Six_Million_Dollar_Man" title="The Six Million Dollar Man">The Six Million Dollar Man</a></i>. <a href="/wiki/Jaime_Sommers_(The_Bionic_Woman)" title="Jaime Sommers (The Bionic Woman)">Jaime Sommers</a> was a tennis pro who was nearly killed in a <a href="/wiki/Parachuting" title="Parachuting">skydiving</a> accident, but her life was saved by <a href="/wiki/Oscar_Goldman" title="Oscar Goldman">Oscar Goldman</a> (<a href="/wiki/Richard_Anderson" title="Richard Anderson">Richard Anderson</a>) and Dr. Rudy Wells (<a href="/wiki/Martin_E._Brooks" title="Martin E.

</p><p>More complex multi-production franchises can utilize crossovers of characters to serve as a device in establishing continuity in a shared fictional universe. This crossover is common in the <a href="/wiki/Star_Trek_crossovers" title="Star Trek crossovers"><i>Star Trek</i> universe</a>, where minor guest stars from one series have appeared as featured guest stars later ones. A good example of this crossover is that of the <a href="/wiki/Klingon" title="Klingon">Klingons</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kor_(Star_Trek)" title="Kor (Star Trek)">Kor</a> (from the <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Original_Series" title="Star Trek: The Original Series">Original Series</a></i> episode "<a href="/wiki/Errand_of_Mercy" title="Errand of Mercy">Errand of Mercy</a>"), <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Koloth" title="Koloth">Koloth</a> (from "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Trouble_With_Tribbles" title="The Trouble With Tribbles">The Trouble With Tribbles</a>") and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kang_(Star_Trek)" title="Kang (Star Trek)">Kang</a> (from "<a href="/wiki/Day_of_the_Dove" title="Day of the Dove">Day of the Dove</a>"). After the passage of about a century of narrative time, the three onetime adversaries of <a href="/wiki/James_T._Kirk" title="James T. Kirk">Captain Kirk</a> appeared together in the <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Trek:_Deep_Space_Nine" title="Star Trek: Deep Space Nine">Star Trek: Deep Space Nine</a></i> episode, "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Blood_Oath_(DS9_episode)" title="Blood Oath (DS9 episode)">Blood Oath</a>" – as the Klingons and Federation had become allies in the century between, the former villains are now portrayed as heroes. Another Klingon, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arne_Darvin" title="Arne Darvin">Arne Darvin</a>, appeared as a secondary character in "The Trouble with Tribbles", but was the principal villain of DS9's "<a href="/wiki/Trials_and_Tribble-ations" title="Trials and Tribble-ations">Trials and Tribble-ations</a>". Intended as a celebration of the franchise's 30th anniversary, "Trials and Tribble-ations" was actually a crossover in and of itself; using then brand-new <a href="/wiki/Chroma_key" title="Chroma key">bluescreen</a> techniques, the episode places the DS9 cast (after hijacking the <i><a href="/wiki/USS_Defiant" title="USS Defiant">Defiant</a></i>, Darvin had gone back in time hoping to kill Kirk and become a hero to the Klingons, and it's up to <a href="/wiki/Benjamin_Sisko" title="Benjamin Sisko">Sisko</a> and his comrades to stop Darvin and preserve the timeline) inside the TOS episode, interacting with <a href="/wiki/James_T._Kirk" title="James T. Kirk">James T. Kirk</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spock" title="Spock">Spock</a> and the rest of the <i><a href="/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701)" title="USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)">Enterprise</a></i> crew.
</p><p>The distinction between "spin-off" and "crossover" is sometimes narrow. The two terms can become especially conflated if two shows are linked by a guest star with a single appearance. There is debate, for instance over whether <i><a href="/wiki/Out_of_the_Blue_(1979_TV_series)" title="Out of the Blue (1979 TV series)">Out of the Blue</a></i> is a spin-off of <i><a href="/wiki/Happy_Days" title="Happy Days">Happy Days</a></i>, or whether the star of <i>Out of the Blue</i> merely crossed over into <i>Happy Days</i>.
</p><p><i><a href="/wiki/Mako:_Island_of_Secrets" title="Mako: Island of Secrets">Mako Mermaids</a></i>, a spinoff of <i><a href="/wiki/H2O:_Just_Add_Water" title="H2O: Just Add Water">H2O: Just Add Water</a></i>, featured a guest appearance by Rikki Chadwick, a main character from the former series, in its final two episodes, thus confirming that the spin off-acts as a sequel rather than a prequel or alternative storyline as many fans suspected.
</p><p>Often, the problems of bringing together two shows with different narrative ambitions make the writing of a crossover burdensome. Such difficulties are encountered by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Situation_comedies" title="Situation comedies">situation comedies</a> that wish to crossover with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Television_drama" title="Television drama">dramatic television</a> programs. The satirical crossover—ranging in length from a cameo to a full <a href="/wiki/Sketch_comedy" title="Sketch comedy">comedy sketch</a> or episode—is an extremely popular way of circumventing this problem. By various means, such crossovers typically avoid outcry from fans by being obvious <a href="/wiki/Parody" title="Parody">parody</a> or <a href="/wiki/Homage_(arts)" title="Homage (arts)">homage</a>. However, on rare occasion, the humor of such crossovers can be used by one show make a <a href="/wiki/Narrative" title="Narrative">narrative</a> point by capitalizing on the audience's experience of the other program.
</p><p>Such <a href="/wiki/Tongue-in-cheek" title="Tongue-in-cheek">tongue-in-cheek</a> crossovers typically fall into one of several broad categories.
</p><p>Sometimes, crossovers occur even when there was no explicit intent to create them. Viewer interpretation can play into the size and complexity of crossovers. These sorts of crossovers involve no creation of additional material, but merely result from inferences drawn about existing filmed episodes. Usually they are a product of narrative ambiguity. Perhaps the best example of this was caused by the unusual ending to <i><a href="/wiki/St._Elsewhere" title="St. Elsewhere">St. Elsewhere</a></i>. One interpretation of the ending scene of the final episode has been that the entire run of the program was a figment of <a href="/wiki/Autism" title="Autism">autistic</a> character Tommy Westphall's imagination. This leads itself to a broad interpretation of the events of that series. Because the show had direct crossovers with twelve different programmes, and each one of these twelve had numerous <i>other</i> crossovers, linkages can be found from <i>Elsewhere</i> to 280 other shows, comprising what has been called "the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tommy_Westphall_Universe" title="Tommy Westphall Universe">Tommy Westphall Universe</a>".<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

Billionaire Bruce Wayne, who has operated in <a href="/wiki/Gotham_City" title="Gotham City">Gotham City</a> as the vigilante <a href="/wiki/Batman" title="Batman">Batman</a> for twenty years, sees Superman as an extraterrestrial threat to humanity.

Believing he should have detected the bomb, and frustrated by his failure to save them, Superman goes into self-imposed exile. Batman breaks into LexCorp and steals the kryptonite.

Superman tries to explain the situation to Batman, but instead Batman attacks Superman and eventually subdues him with the aid of a kryptonite gas. Before Batman can kill Superman with the spear, Superman urges Batman to "save Martha", whose name is also shared with Batman's mother, confusing him long enough for Lois to arrive and explain what Superman meant. Realizing how far he has fallen and unwilling to let an innocent die, Batman rescues Martha, while Superman confronts Luthor on the scout ship.

In the creature's last moments, it kills Superman, himself weakened by exposure to kryptonite.
</p><p>Luthor is arrested and Batman confronts him in prison, warning Luthor that he will always be watching him. Luthor gloats that Superman's death has made the world vulnerable to powerful alien threats. A memorial is held for Superman in Metropolis.

Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him.
</p><p>While Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, the latter attacked Zuri and forced T'Chaka to kill him. T'Chaka ordered Zuri to lie that N'Jobu had disappeared and left behind N'Jobu's American son in order to maintain the lie. This boy grew up to be Stevens, a U.S. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Black_ops" title="Black ops">black ops</a> soldier who adopted the name "Killmonger". Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity to be N'Jadaka and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat, where he kills Zuri, defeats T'Challa, and hurls him over a waterfall to his presumed death. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first. Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.
</p><p>Nakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit. W'Kabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down planes carrying the vibranium weapons. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated.

When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed "Winter Soldiers" are kept in <a href="/wiki/Suspended_animation" title="Suspended animation">cryogenic stasis</a>.

</p><p>Stark discovers evidence that Barnes was framed by Zemo and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes, unaware that they were secretly followed by T'Challa. They find that the other super-soldiers have been killed by Zemo, who then shows them footage that reveals that the automobile Barnes had intercepted in 1991 contained Stark's parents, whom Barnes subsequently killed. Enraged that Rogers kept this from him, Stark turns on them both, leading to an intense fight, in which Stark destroys Barnes' robotic arm, and Rogers disables <a href="/wiki/Iron_Man%27s_armor_in_other_media#Live_action" title="Iron Man's armor in other media">Stark's armor</a>.

Enraged at being driven out of business, Toomes persuades his employees to keep the <a href="/wiki/Chitauri" title="Chitauri">Chitauri</a> technology they have already scavenged and use it to create and sell advanced weapons. Eight years later, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Peter_Parker" title="Peter Parker">Peter Parker</a> is drafted into the <a href="/wiki/Avengers_(comics)" title="Avengers (comics)">Avengers</a> by Stark to help with an internal dispute,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Timeline_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Timeline-9">[N 2]</a></sup> but resumes his studies at the <a href="/wiki/Midtown_High_School" title="Midtown High School">Midtown School of Science and Technology</a> when Stark tells him he is not yet ready to become a full Avenger.
</p><p>Parker quits his school's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Academic_decathlon" title="Academic decathlon">academic decathlon</a> team to spend more time focusing on his crime-fighting activities as Spider-Man. One night, after preventing criminals from robbing an ATM with their advanced weapons from Toomes, Parker returns to his <a href="/wiki/Queens" title="Queens">Queens</a> apartment where his best friend Ned discovers his secret identity. On another night, Parker comes across Toomes' associates <a href="/wiki/Montana_(comics)#Film" title="Montana (comics)">Jackson Brice / Shocker</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shocker_(comics)" title="Shocker (comics)">Herman Schultz</a> selling weapons to local criminal <a href="/wiki/Prowler_(comics)" title="Prowler (comics)">Aaron Davis</a>. Parker saves Davis before being caught by Toomes and dropped in a lake, nearly drowning after becoming tangled in a parachute built into his suit. He is rescued by Stark, who is monitoring the Spider-Man suit he gave Parker and warns him against further involvement with the criminals. Toomes accidentally kills Brice with one of their weapons, and Schultz becomes the new Shocker.
</p><p>Parker and Ned study a weapon left behind by Brice, removing its power core. When a tracking device on Schultz leads to Maryland, Parker rejoins the decathlon team and accompanies them to Washington, D.C. for their national tournament. Ned and Parker disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit, and unlock its advanced features. Parker tries to stop Toomes from stealing weapons from a D.O.D.C. truck, but is trapped inside the truck, causing him to miss the decathlon tournament. When he discovers that the power core is an unstable Chitauri grenade, Parker races to the <a href="/wiki/Washington_Monument" title="Washington Monument">Washington Monument</a> where the core explodes and traps Ned and their friends in an elevator. Evading local authorities, Parker saves his friends, including his fellow classmate and crush <a href="/wiki/Liz_Allan" title="Liz Allan">Liz</a>.

</p><p>Parker returns to his high school life, and eventually asks Liz to go to the <a href="/wiki/Homecoming" title="Homecoming">homecoming</a> dance with him. On the night of the dance, Parker learns that Toomes is Liz’s father. Deducing Parker's secret identity from Liz's account about him, Toomes threatens retaliation if he interferes with his plans. During the dance, Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a D.O.D.C. plane transporting weapons from <a href="/wiki/Stark_Tower" title="Stark Tower">Avengers Tower</a> to the team's new headquarters, dons his old homemade Spider-Man suit and races to Toomes' lair. He is first ambushed by Schultz, but defeats him with the help of Ned. At the lair, Toomes destroys the building's support beams and leaves Parker to die. Parker escapes the rubble and intercepts the plane, steering it to crash on the beach near <a href="/wiki/Coney_Island" title="Coney Island">Coney Island</a>. He and Toomes continue fighting, ending with Parker saving Toomes' life after the damaged Vulture suit explodes, and leaving him for the <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department" title="New York City Police Department">police</a> along with the plane's cargo. After her father's arrest, Liz moves away, and Parker declines an invitation from Stark to join the Avengers full-time. Stark returns Parker's suit, which he puts on in his bedroom just as his <a href="/wiki/Aunt_May" title="Aunt May">Aunt May</a> walks in.

After Rocket steals some for himself, the Sovereign attacks the Guardians' ship with a fleet of drones. These are destroyed by a mysterious figure, and the Guardians crash-land on a nearby planet. There, this figure reveals himself as Quill's father, <a href="/wiki/Ego_the_Living_Planet" title="Ego the Living Planet">Ego</a>, and invites Quill, Gamora, and Drax to his home planet. Rocket and Groot remain behind to repair the ship and guard Nebula.

They capture Rocket, but when Yondu hesitates to turn over Quill, whom he raised, his lieutenant <a href="/wiki/Taserface" title="Taserface">Taserface</a> leads a mutiny with help from Nebula. Taserface imprisons Rocket and Yondu aboard the latter's ship and executes his loyalists by releasing them into space.

Ego hired Yondu to collect the young Quill after Meredith's death, but the boy was never delivered and Ego has been searching for him ever since. He teaches Quill to manipulate Celestial power. Nebula arrives at Ego's planet and tries to kill Gamora, but the pair reach an uneasy alliance when they discover a cavern filled with skeletal remains. Ego reveals to Quill that in his travels, he planted seedlings on thousands of worlds which can <a href="/wiki/Terraforming" title="Terraforming">terraform</a> into new extensions of himself, but they can only be activated by the power of two Celestials. To that end, he impregnated countless women and hired Yondu to collect the children, but killed them all when they failed to access the Celestial power. Under Ego's influence, Quill helps him activate the seedlings, which begin to consume every world, but Quill fights back when Ego reveals that he gave Meredith the tumour that killed her due to the distraction she posed.

Gamora and Nebula also learn of the plan as Rocket, Yondu, Groot, and Kraglin arrive. As they come under attack from the Sovereign's drones, the reunited Guardians find Ego's brain at the planet's core. Rocket makes a bomb using the stolen batteries, which Groot plants on the brain. Quill fights Ego with his newfound Celestial powers to distract him long enough for the other Guardians and Mantis to escape. The bomb explodes, killing Ego and disintegrating the planet. Yondu sacrifices himself to save Quill, who realizes that the reason Yondu kept him was to spare him from the fate of Ego's other progeny, and that Yondu was Quill's true "daddy". Having reconciled with Gamora, Nebula still chooses to leave and resume her quest to kill Thanos by herself. The Guardians hold a funeral for Yondu, which is attended by Kraglin and dozens of Ravager ships, acknowledging Yondu's sacrifice and accepting him as a Ravager again.

Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a <a href="/wiki/Paraplegia" title="Paraplegia">paraplegic</a> who mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by <a href="/wiki/Baron_Mordo" title="Baron Mordo">Mordo</a>, a sorcerer under the Ancient One.

Scott and Hope distract Ava while Hank enters the quantum realm to retrieve Janet, but Burch and his men also attack Scott and Hope which allows Ava to begin forcibly taking Janet's energy. Luis, Dave, and Kurt help incapacitate Sonny and his men so that Scott and Hope can stop Ava. Hank and Janet return safely from the quantum realm, and Janet voluntarily gifts some of her energy to Ava to temporarily stabilize her. When the authorities arrive, everyone flees the scene.

Stark escapes in an experimental new Iron Man suit, which his <a href="/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> <a href="/wiki/Edwin_Jarvis" title="Edwin Jarvis">J.A.R.V.I.S.</a> pilots to rural Tennessee, following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's new armor is not fully functional, and lacks sufficient power to return to California, leaving the world to believe him dead.
</p><p>Teaming with Harley, a 10-year-old boy, Stark investigates the remains of a local explosion bearing the hallmarks of a Mandarin attack. He discovers the "bombings" were triggered by soldiers subjected to Extremis whose bodies explosively rejected the treatment. These explosions were falsely attributed to a terrorist plot in order to cover up Extremis's flaws. Stark witnesses Extremis firsthand when Mandarin agents <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ellen_Brandt" title="Ellen Brandt">Brandt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Coldblood" title="Coldblood">Savin</a> attack him. Meanwhile, Killian resurfaces and kidnaps Potts and Hansen.

</p><p>With Harley's help, Stark traces the Mandarin to <a href="/wiki/Miami" title="Miami">Miami</a> and infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. Inside he discovers the Mandarin is actually an English actor named <a href="/wiki/Trevor_Slattery" title="Trevor Slattery">Trevor Slattery</a>, who is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image. Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin behind Slattery's cover. After capturing Stark, Killian reveals that he has subjected Potts to Extremis in the hope that Stark will help fix Extremis's flaws while trying to save her. Killian kills Hansen when she tries to stop him.
</p><p>Stark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard <a href="/wiki/Air_Force_One" title="Air Force One">Air Force One</a>, using the Iron Patriot armor. Stark saves some surviving passengers and crew but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. They trace Killian to an impounded damaged oil tanker where Killian intends to kill Ellis on live television. The Vice President will become a puppet leader, following Killian's orders in exchange for Extremis to cure his young daughter's disability. On the platform, Stark works to save Potts, as Rhodes goes after the President. Stark summons his remaining Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Rhodes secures the President and takes him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived the Extremis procedure; before he can save her, a rig collapses around them and she falls to her apparent death. Stark confronts Killian and traps him in an Iron Man suit that he self-destructs, but fails to kill him. Potts, whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive her fall, intervenes and kills Killian.
</p><p>Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy each Iron Man suit as a sign of his devotion to Potts, while the Vice President and Slattery are arrested. With Stark's help, Potts' Extremis effects are stabilized, and Stark promises to scale back his life as Iron Man, undergoing surgery to remove the shrapnel near his heart and throwing his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea. He muses that, even without the technology, he will always be Iron Man.
</p><p>In 1988, following his mother's death, a young <a href="/wiki/Star-Lord" title="Star-Lord">Peter Quill</a> is abducted from Earth by the Ravagers, a group of space pirates led by <a href="/wiki/Yondu" title="Yondu">Yondu Udonta</a>. Twenty-six years later on the planet Morag, Quill steals a mysterious orb but is attacked by <a href="/wiki/Korath_the_Pursuer" title="Korath the Pursuer">Korath</a>, a subordinate to the fanatical <a href="/wiki/Kree" title="Kree">Kree</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ronan_the_Accuser" title="Ronan the Accuser">Ronan</a>. Although Quill escapes with the orb, Yondu discovers his theft and issues a bounty for his capture, while Ronan sends the assassin <a href="/wiki/Gamora" title="Gamora">Gamora</a> after the orb.
</p><p>When Quill attempts to sell the orb on <a href="/wiki/Xandar" title="Xandar">Xandar</a>, capital of the Nova Empire, Gamora ambushes him and steals it. A fight ensues, drawing in a pair of bounty hunters: the genetically and cybernetically modified raccoon <a href="/wiki/Rocket_Raccoon" title="Rocket Raccoon">Rocket</a>, and the tree-like humanoid <a href="/wiki/Groot" title="Groot">Groot</a>. <a href="/wiki/Nova_Corps" title="Nova Corps">Nova Corps</a> officers capture the four, detaining them in the Kyln prison. A powerful inmate there, <a href="/wiki/Drax_the_Destroyer" title="Drax the Destroyer">Drax</a>, attempts to kill Gamora due to her association with Ronan and <a href="/wiki/Thanos" title="Thanos">Thanos</a>, who killed his family. Quill convinces Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him, though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use the orb's power. Learning that Gamora has a buyer for the orb, Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work with her to escape the Kyln in Quill's ship, the <i>Milano</i>.
</p><p>Ronan meets with Gamora's adoptive father, Thanos, to discuss her betrayal. Quill's group flee to <a href="/wiki/Knowhere" title="Knowhere">Knowhere</a>, a remote criminal outpost in space built in the giant severed head of a <a href="/wiki/Celestial_(comics)" title="Celestial (comics)">Celestial</a>. A drunken Drax summons Ronan while the rest of the group meet Gamora's contact, the collector <a href="/wiki/Collector_(comics)" title="Collector (comics)">Taneleer Tivan</a>. Tivan opens the orb, revealing an <a href="/wiki/Infinity_Gems" title="Infinity Gems">Infinity Stone</a>, an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. Tivan's slave Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's archive.
</p><p>Ronan arrives and easily defeats Drax, while the others flee by ship, pursued by Ronan's followers and Gamora's adoptive sister <a href="/wiki/Nebula_(comics)" title="Nebula (comics)">Nebula</a>. Nebula destroys Gamora's ship, leaving her floating in space, and Ronan's fighters capture the orb. Quill contacts Yondu before following Gamora into space, giving her his helmet to survive; Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. Rocket, Drax, and Groot threaten to attack Yondu's ship to rescue them, but Quill negotiates a truce, promising the orb to Yondu. Quill's group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death, but that they cannot let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy. On Ronan's flagship, the <i>Dark Aster</i>, Ronan embeds the Stone in his warhammer, taking its power for himself. He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after first destroying Xandar; hateful of her adoptive father, Nebula allies with Ronan.
</p><p>The Ravagers and Quill's group join with the Nova Corps to confront the <i>Dark Aster</i> at Xandar, with Quill's group breaching the <i>Dark Aster</i> with the <i>Milano</i>. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. Drax and Gamora defeat Korath and Nebula, the latter escaping, but the group find themselves outmatched by Ronan's power until Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the <i>Dark Aster</i>. The damaged <i>Dark Aster</i> crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, they use it to destroy Ronan.
</p><p>In the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu into taking a container supposedly containing the Stone, and gives the real Stone to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract. Quill's group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, have their criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother: a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs. The Guardians leave in the rebuilt <i>Milano</i> along with a sapling <a href="/wiki/Cutting_(plant)" title="Cutting (plant)">cut</a> from Groot.

Using data in the flash drive, they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker in New Jersey, where they activate a supercomputer containing the <a href="/wiki/Mind_uploading" title="Mind uploading">preserved consciousness</a> of <a href="/wiki/Arnim_Zola" title="Arnim Zola">Arnim Zola</a>. Zola reveals that ever since S.H.I.E.L.D. was founded after <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the antagonistic organisation <a href="/wiki/Hydra_(comics)" title="Hydra (comics)">Hydra</a> has secretly operated within its ranks, sowing global chaos with the objective of making humanity surrender its freedom in exchange for security. Rogers and Romanoff narrowly escape death when a S.H.I.E.L.D. missile destroys the bunker. It is revealed that Pierce is Hydra's leader within S.H.I.E.L.D. when the Winter Soldier is seen in his apartment.
</p><p>Rogers and Romanoff enlist the help of former <a href="/wiki/United_States_Air_Force_Pararescue" title="United States Air Force Pararescue">USAF pararescueman</a> <a href="/wiki/Falcon_(comics)" title="Falcon (comics)">Sam Wilson</a>, an acquaintance of Rogers, and acquire his <a href="/wiki/Wingsuit_flying" title="Wingsuit flying">powered wingpack</a>, code named "Falcon". Deducing that Pierce is Hydra's leader and that S.H.I.E.L.D. agent <a href="/wiki/Jasper_Sitwell" title="Jasper Sitwell">Jasper Sitwell</a> is a Hydra <a href="/wiki/Mole_(espionage)" title="Mole (espionage)">mole</a>, they force Sitwell to divulge that Zola developed a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Data-mining" title="Data-mining">data-mining</a> algorithm that can identify individuals that have been, are, or will become threats to Hydra. The Insight Helicarriers will sweep the globe, using satellite-guided guns to eliminate these individuals. While driving back to the Triskelion, planning to infiltrate it, Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson are ambushed by the Winter Soldier, who kills Sitwell. During a subsequent fight with Rogers, the Winter Soldier's mask is dislodged; Rogers recognizes him as <a href="/wiki/Bucky_Barnes" title="Bucky Barnes">Bucky Barnes</a>, his childhood best friend who supposedly fell to his death on a mission. Shaken by the reveal, Rogers, along with Romanoff and Wilson, is captured by S.T.R.I.K.E. Rogers deduces that Bucky survived the fall after being captured and experimented on by Zola, and that Hydra must have found him afterwards. Having infiltrated the S.T.R.I.K.E. agents, Hill manages to extract the trio to a safehouse where Fury, revealed to have faked his death, is waiting with plans to sabotage the Helicarriers by replacing three of their controller chips. At a bank, Hydra agents come together to debrief the Winter Soldier; after discovering that he recognized Rogers, Pierce orders that his memory be wiped.
</p><p>As members of the World Security Council arrive for the launch of Project Insight, Rogers infiltrates the Triskelion and broadcasts Hydra's plot to everyone there. Romanoff, disguised as one of the Council members, disarms Pierce and accesses his computer. Fury then arrives and forces Pierce to help him unlock S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database so that Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra to the public. Pierce attempts to escape after revealing he can indirectly kill all the World Security Council members, including the disguised Romanoff; following a struggle, Fury kills Pierce. Meanwhile, Rogers and Wilson storm two of the Helicarriers and replace the controller chips. However, the Winter Soldier is waiting on the third one, and after destroying Wilson's suit he begins to fight Rogers. Rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip, allowing Hill to take control and have the vessels destroy each other. Seeing the Winter Soldier still on the Helicarrier, Rogers approaches him, refusing to fight him in an attempt to reach his friend. As the Winter Soldier once again begins to recognize him, the ship collides with the Triskelion, throwing Rogers into the <a href="/wiki/Potomac_River" title="Potomac River">Potomac River</a>. Diving in after him, the Winter Soldier rescues the unconscious Rogers before disappearing into the woods. 
</p><p>With S.H.I.E.L.D. in disarray, Romanoff makes an official statement before a Senate subcommittee, and Fury, under the cover of his apparent death, heads to Eastern Europe in pursuit of Hydra's remaining cells. Rumlow is hospitalized after being crushed during the Triskelion's destruction, Romanoff (who revealed her own tainted past after leaking the S.H.I.E.L.D. files) leaves to find a new cover, and Wilson decides to help Rogers search for the Winter Soldier.

</p><p>In London, astrophysicist Dr. <a href="/wiki/Jane_Foster_(comics)" title="Jane Foster (comics)">Jane Foster</a> and her intern Darcy Lewis travel to an abandoned factory where such portals have appeared, disrupting the laws of physics around them. Separating from the group, Foster is teleported to another world, where she is infected by the Aether. <a href="/wiki/Heimdall_(comics)" title="Heimdall (comics)">Heimdall</a> alerts Thor that Foster has moved beyond his near all-seeing vision, leading Thor to Earth. When Thor finds Foster, she inadvertently releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard.

</p><p>Malekith, awakened by the Aether's release, turns Algrim into a Kursed and attacks Asgard. During the battle, Malekith and Algrim search for Foster, sensing that she contains the Aether. Thor's mother <a href="/wiki/Frigga_(comics)" title="Frigga (comics)">Frigga</a> is killed protecting Foster, and Malekith and Algrim are forced to flee without Foster. Despite Odin's orders not to leave Asgard, Thor reluctantly enlists the help of Loki, who knows of a secret portal to Svartalfheim, where they will use Foster to lure and confront Malekith, away from Asgard. In return, Thor promises Loki vengeance on Malekith for killing their mother. With Volstagg and Sif stalling Asgardian soldiers and Fandral assisting their escape, Thor, Loki, and Foster head to Svartalfheim.
</p><p>There, Loki tricks Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Foster, but Thor's attempt to destroy the exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki is fatally wounded while killing Algrim. Thor, cradling Loki in his arms, promises to tell their father of his sacrifice. Afterward, Thor and Foster discover another portal in a nearby cave and reunite in London with Lewis and Foster's mentor Dr. <a href="/wiki/Erik_Selvig" title="Erik Selvig">Erik Selvig</a>—who was briefly institutionalized due to the mental trauma he suffered during Loki's attack on Earth.

Thor battles Malekith through various portals and across multiple worlds until one portal separates them, leaving Malekith unopposed on Earth. Thor returns in time to help his mortal comrades use their scientific equipment to transport Malekith to Svartalfheim, where he is crushed by his own damaged ship.

Believing the technology is dangerous, Pym vows to hide it as long as he lives.
</p><p>In the present day,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Timeline_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-Timeline-6">[N 1]</a></sup> Pym's estranged daughter, <a href="/wiki/Hope_Pym" title="Hope Pym">Hope van Dyne</a>, and former protégé, <a href="/wiki/Darren_Cross" title="Darren Cross">Darren Cross</a>, have forced him out of his company, Pym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the <a href="/wiki/Yellowjacket_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)">Yellowjacket</a>, which horrifies Pym.
</p><p>Upon his release from prison, well-meaning thief <a href="/wiki/Ant-Man_(Scott_Lang)" title="Ant-Man (Scott Lang)">Scott Lang</a> moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. Lang visits his daughter <a href="/wiki/Cassandra_Lang" title="Cassandra Lang">Cassie</a> unannounced and is chastised by his former wife Maggie and her police-detective fiancé, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold down a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect.  Terrified by the experience, he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested on the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out.
</p><p>Pym, who manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross. Having been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions, Van Dyne and Pym train Lang to fight and to control ants. While Van Dyne harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother Janet's death, he reveals that Janet, known as the <a href="/wiki/Wasp_(comics)" title="Wasp (comics)">Wasp</a>, disappeared into a subatomic <a href="/wiki/Features_of_the_Marvel_Universe#Extradimensional_places" title="Features of the Marvel Universe">quantum realm</a> while disabling a <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator. They send him to steal a device that will aid their heist from the <a href="/wiki/Avengers_(comics)" title="Avengers (comics)">Avengers</a>' headquarters, where he briefly fights <a href="/wiki/Falcon_(comics)" title="Falcon (comics)">Sam Wilson</a>.

When he attempts to steal the Yellowjacket, he, along with Pym and Van Dyne, are captured by Cross, who intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and Ant-Man suits to <a href="/wiki/Hydra_(comics)" title="Hydra (comics)">Hydra</a>. Lang breaks free and he and Van Dyne dispatch most of the Hydra agents, though one flees with a vial of Cross' particles and Pym is shot. Lang pursues Cross, while the explosives detonate, imploding the building as Pym and Van Dyne escape.
</p><p>Cross dons the Yellowjacket and attacks Lang before Lang is arrested by Paxton. Cross takes Cassie hostage to lure Lang into another fight. Lang overrides the regulator and shrinks to subatomic size to penetrate Cross' suit and sabotage it to shrink uncontrollably, killing Cross. Lang disappears into the quantum realm but manages to reverse the effects and returns to the <a href="/wiki/Macroscopic_scale" title="Macroscopic scale">macroscopic</a> world. Out of gratitude for Lang's heroism, Paxton covers for Lang to keep him out of prison. Seeing that Lang survived and returned from the quantum realm, Pym wonders if his wife is alive as well. Later, Lang meets up with Luis, who tells him that Wilson is looking for him.

Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed.

Six months later,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Timeline_10-0"><a href="#cite_note-Timeline-10">[N 2]</a></sup> Stark is a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs. He reinstitutes the Stark Expo to continue his father <a href="/wiki/Howard_Stark" title="Howard Stark">Howard</a>'s legacy.
</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Palladium" title="Palladium">palladium</a> core in the arc reactor that keeps Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, and choosing not to tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant <a href="/wiki/Pepper_Potts" title="Pepper Potts">Pepper Potts</a> CEO of Stark Industries, and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the <a href="/wiki/Historic_Grand_Prix_of_Monaco" title="Historic Grand Prix of Monaco">Monaco Historic Grand Prix</a>, where he is attacked in the middle of the race by Vanko, who wields electrified whips. Stark dons his Mark V armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, <a href="/wiki/Justin_Hammer" title="Justin Hammer">Justin Hammer</a>, fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Mark IV suit. Disgusted, Stark's best friend, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Air_Force" title="U.S. Air Force">U.S. Air Force</a> Lieutenant Colonel <a href="/wiki/War_Machine" title="War Machine">James Rhodes</a> dons Stark's Mark II prototype armor and tries to restrain him.

Fury explains that Vanko's father jointly invented the arc reactor with Stark, but when Anton tried to sell it for profit, Stark had him deported. The Soviets sent Anton to the gulag. Fury gives Stark some of his father's old material; a hidden message in the <a href="/wiki/Diorama" title="Diorama">diorama</a> of the 1974 Stark Expo proves to be a diagram of the structure of a new element. With the aid of his computer <a href="/wiki/Edwin_Jarvis#J.A.R.V.I.S." title="Edwin Jarvis">J.A.R.V.I.S.</a>, Stark synthesizes it. When he learns Vanko is still alive, he places the new element in his arc reactor and ends his palladium dependency.
</p><p>At the Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the Mark II armor. Stark arrives in the Mark VI armor to warn Rhodes, but Vanko remotely takes control of both the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Iron Man. Hammer is arrested while Romanoff and Stark's bodyguard <a href="/wiki/Happy_Hogan_(comics)" title="Happy Hogan (comics)">Happy Hogan</a> go after Vanko at Hammer's factory. Vanko escapes, but Romanoff returns control of the Mark II armor to Rhodes. Stark and Rhodes together defeat Vanko and his drones. Vanko commits <a href="/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">suicide</a> by blowing up his suit, along with the defeated drones.
</p><p>At a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that because of Stark's difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant. Stark and Rhodes receive medals for their heroism.

After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded by a rocket-propelled grenade used by the attackers: one of his company's own. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings; <a href="/wiki/Ho_Yinsen" title="Ho Yinsen">Yinsen</a>, a fellow captive who is a doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Raza_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Raza (Marvel Comics)">Raza</a> offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but Tony and Yinsen know that Raza will not keep his word.
</p><p>Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a prototypical <a href="/wiki/Iron_Man%27s_armor_in_other_media#Live_action" title="Iron Man's armor in other media">suit of powered armor</a> to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden almost to completion, the Ten Rings discover their hostages' intentions and attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. <a href="/wiki/Iron_Monger" title="Iron Monger">Obadiah Stane</a>, his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor for his chest. Personal assistant <a href="/wiki/Pepper_Potts" title="Pepper Potts">Pepper Potts</a> places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details, a suspicious Stark keeps his work to himself.
</p><p>At a charity event held by Stark Industries, reporter <a href="/wiki/Christine_Everhart" title="Christine Everhart">Christine Everhart</a> informs Stark that his company's weapons were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira. Stark then learns that Stane has been <a href="/wiki/Arms_trafficking" title="Arms trafficking">arms trafficking</a> to criminals worldwide and is staging a <a href="/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat" title="Coup d'état">coup</a> to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves the villagers. While flying home, Stark is shot at by two <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/F-22_Raptor" title="F-22 Raptor">F-22 Raptor</a> fighter jets. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone in an attempt to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who subdues Raza and has the rest of the group killed. Stane has a massive new suit <a href="/wiki/Reverse_engineering" title="Reverse engineering">reverse engineered</a> from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Potts to hack into its database. She discovers that Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged.

</p><p>Stane's scientists cannot duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the one from his chest. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane, but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building, and Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him. The next day, at a press conference, Stark defies suggestions from S.H.I.E.L.D. and publicly admits to being "Iron Man."

Thor, having discovered Mjolnir's nearby location, seeks to retrieve it from the facility that S.H.I.E.L.D. has constructed, but he finds himself unable to lift it and is captured. With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Foster.
</p><p>Loki discovers that he is Laufey's biological son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. A weary Odin falls into the deep "Odinsleep" to recover his strength. Loki takes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket. Sif and the Warriors Three, unhappy with Loki's rule, attempt to return Thor from exile, convincing <a href="/wiki/Heimdall_(comics)" title="Heimdall (comics)">Heimdall</a>, gatekeeper of the <a href="/wiki/Bifr%C3%B6st" title="Bifröst">Bifröst</a>—the means of traveling between worlds—to allow them passage to Earth.

The warriors find Thor, but the Destroyer attacks and defeats them, prompting Thor to offer himself instead. Struck by the Destroyer and near death, Thor's sacrifice proves him worthy to wield Mjölnir. The hammer returns to him, restoring his powers and enabling him to defeat the Destroyer. Kissing Foster goodbye and vowing to return, he and his fellow Asgardians leave to confront Loki.
</p><p>In Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifröst Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifröst Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki apparently commits suicide by allowing himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king; meanwhile, on Earth, Foster and her team search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.

</p><p>Schmidt and Dr. <a href="/wiki/Arnim_Zola" title="Arnim Zola">Arnim Zola</a> harness the energies of the Tesseract, intending to use the power to fuel Zola's inventions, mounting an offensive that will change the world.

Rogers infiltrates the fortress of Schmidt's Nazi division <a href="/wiki/Hydra_(comics)" title="Hydra (comics)">Hydra</a>, freeing Barnes and the other prisoners.

The experiment—part of a <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>-era <a href="/wiki/Weapon_Plus" title="Weapon Plus">"super soldier" program</a> that Ross hopes to recreate—fails, and the exposure to gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hulk_(comics)" title="Hulk (comics)">Hulk</a> for brief periods of time, whenever his heart rate rises above 200 beats per minute. The Hulk destroys the lab and surrounding area, killing several people inside, and injuring the General and Betty, along with others outside. Banner becomes a fugitive from the U.S. military and Ross in particular, who wants to weaponize the Hulk.

On the internet, he collaborates with a colleague he knows only as "Mr. Blue", and to whom he is "Mr. Green". He is learning <a href="/wiki/Yoga" title="Yoga">Yoga</a> techniques to help keep control, and has not transformed in five months. After Banner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, and is eventually ingested by an elderly consumer in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Milwaukee,_Wisconsin" title="Milwaukee, Wisconsin">Milwaukee, Wisconsin</a>, giving him gamma sickness. Using the bottle to track down Banner, Ross sends a special forces team, led by Russian-born British <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Royal_Marine" title="Royal Marine">Royal Marine</a> <a href="/wiki/Abomination_(comics)" title="Abomination (comics)">Emil Blonsky</a>, to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team. After Ross explains how Banner became the Hulk, Blonsky agrees to be injected with a small amount of a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton and impair his judgment.
</p><p>Banner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty, who is dating psychiatrist <a href="/wiki/Doc_Samson" title="Doc Samson">Leonard Samson</a>. Banner is attacked a second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces, tipped off by the suspicious Samson, causing him to again transform into the Hulk. The ensuing battle outside the university proves futile for Ross' forces and they retreat, though Blonsky, whose sanity is faltering, attacks and mocks the Hulk. The Hulk seemingly kills Blonsky and flees with Betty. After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City. Mr. Blue is actually cellular biologist Dr. <a href="/wiki/Leader_(comics)" title="Leader (comics)">Samuel Sterns</a>, who tells Banner he has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation. Sterns reveals he has <a href="/wiki/Organic_synthesis" title="Organic synthesis">synthesized</a> Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, with the intention of applying its "limitless potential" to medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply.
</p><p>Blonsky has survived the battle at Culver University and completely healed. He joins Ross' forces for a third attempt to take Banner into custody. They succeed and Banner, along with Betty, are taken away in a helicopter. Blonsky stays behind and orders Sterns to inject him with Banner's blood, as he covets the Hulk's power. Sterns warns that the combination of the super-soldier formula and Banner's blood may cause him to become an "abomination", but Blonsky insists. The experiment mutates Blonsky into a creature with size and strength surpassing that of the Hulk, but drives him insane. He attacks Sterns, who gets some of Banner's blood in a cut on his forehead, causing him to begin mutating as well. 
</p><p>Blonsky rampages through <a href="/wiki/Harlem" title="Harlem">Harlem</a>. Realizing that the Hulk is the only one who can stop Blonsky, Banner convinces Ross to release him.

</p><p>Those plans Pollock saw, however were drastically changed after <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Empire_Strikes_Back" title="Empire Strikes Back">Empire Strikes Back</a></i> released because Lucas decided not to make the sequel trilogy, and instead finish the story as a trilogy, by ending the storyline with <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Episode_VI:_Return_of_the_Jedi" title="Episode VI: Return of the Jedi">Episode VI: Return of the Jedi</a></i>.

</p><p>This period lasted from 1983 to the 2010s, when Lucas started to develop his ideas for a sequel trilogy.
</p><p>After release of <i>Return of the Jedi</i> in 1983, Lucas gave many hints about many of the plot elements from his discarded 1980s script treatments for the sequel trilogy, or what would happen if he were to make a sequel trilogy. Those discarded plots continued to fascinate fans for decades, as many of them were completely unaffected by the conclusion of the original trilogy; thus leaving the sequel trilogy a possibility of using them.
</p><p>While many ideas seem to have been retained, these two particular ideas were apparently discarded for Lucasfilm's sequel trilogy, under Disney's ownership:
</p><p>Lucas' ideas that have been somewhat partially or completely retained by the trilogy that ultimately was made, include:
</p><p>During the early 1990s, Lucas allowed writer <a href="/wiki/Timothy_Zahn" title="Timothy Zahn">Timothy Zahn</a> to write a <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Star_Wars_expanded_universe" title="Star Wars expanded universe">Star Wars expanded universe</a></i> novel series set after the events in the original trilogy, which was called the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thrawn_Trilogy" title="Thrawn Trilogy">Thrawn Trilogy</a>. This decision meant that Lucas decided to further cancel the sequel trilogy, with many hundreds of subsequent other works set after the original trilogy. From 1997 onwards, Lucas took it a step further, when he ceased to talk about his sequel trilogy ideas. When asked, he would frequently repeat that he had no plans to make the sequel trilogy and that he would not allow other directors to make it.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Starlog237_16-1"><a href="#cite_note-Starlog237-16">[16]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Insider35_22-0"><a href="#cite_note-Insider35-22">[22]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-23"><a href="#cite_note-23">[23]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-24"><a href="#cite_note-24">[24]</a></sup><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-25"><a href="#cite_note-25">[25]</a></sup> He gave various explanations for the apparent abandonment of plans to film the sequel trilogy.
</p><p>At a 1997 "Special Edition" press conference, Lucas said: "Everyone said, 'Well, are you going to do sequels to the first three?' But that was an afterthought; I don't have scripts on those stories. The only notion on that was, wouldn't it be fun to get all the actors to come back when they're 60 or 70 years old and make three more about them as old people."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Starlog237_16-2"><a href="#cite_note-Starlog237-16">[16]</a></sup> In a 1997 issue of <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_Insider" title="Star Wars Insider">Star Wars Insider</a></i>, he said: "The whole story has six episodes.... If I ever went beyond that, it would be something that was made up. I really don't have any notion other than, 'Gee, it would be interesting to do Luke Skywalker later on.' It wouldn't be part of the main story, but a sequel to this thing."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Insider35_22-1"><a href="#cite_note-Insider35-22">[22]</a></sup>
</p><p>However Lucas was not made with the <i>Star Wars</i> franchise, his attention however was not on the sequel trilogy, as it had shifted towards the story before the original trilogy. Between 1999 and 2005, Lucas would return to the universe he had created, by writing and directing, what would become the prequel trilogy of Episodes <i>I</i>, <i>II</i>, and <i>III</i>. and decided to end the saga as six films. This prevented him from developing a sequel trilogy during that time-frame.

In an interview published in the February 1999 issue of <i><a href="/wiki/Vanity_Fair_(magazine)" title="Vanity Fair (magazine)">Vanity Fair</a></i>, Lucas said: "When you see it in six parts, you'll understand.

Discovering she can use the Force, Rey escapes by using a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jedi_mind_trick" title="Jedi mind trick">Jedi mind trick</a> on a nearby guard.
</p><p>At the Resistance base on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/D%27Qar" title="D'Qar">D'Qar</a>, BB-8 finds <a href="/wiki/R2-D2" title="R2-D2">R2-D2</a>, who has been inactive since Luke's disappearance. As Starkiller Base prepares to fire on D'Qar, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy it by attacking a critical facility. Using the <i>Falcon</i>, Han, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the facility, find Rey, and plant explosives. Han confronts Kylo, calling him by his birth name, Ben, and implores him to abandon the dark side. Kylo refuses and kills Han, enraging Chewbacca, who shoots Kylo and sets off the explosives, allowing the Resistance to attack and destroy the base.
</p><p>The injured Kylo pursues Finn and Rey to the surface. Kylo defeats Finn in a lightsaber duel, leaving him wounded. Rey takes the lightsaber and uses the Force to defeat Kylo before they are separated by a fissure as the planet begins to disintegrate. Snoke orders Hux to evacuate and bring Kylo to him to complete his training. Rey and Chewbacca escape with the unconscious Finn in the <i>Falcon</i>. On D'Qar, Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey mourn Han's death. <span class="nowrap">R2-D2</span> awakens and reveals the rest of the map, which Rey follows to the oceanic planet Ahch-To.

Unbeknownst to Luke, Rey and Kylo communicate through the Force, puzzling the two enemies. As Rey and Kylo learn about each other, both have visions of themselves as future partners.
</p><p>R2-D2 persuades Luke to train Rey. After Kylo tells Rey what happened between him and Luke that caused him to choose the dark side, Luke confesses that he momentarily contemplated killing Kylo upon sensing that <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Leader_Snoke" title="Supreme Leader Snoke">Supreme Leader Snoke</a> was corrupting him, causing Kylo to destroy Luke's new Jedi Order in retaliation. Convinced that Kylo can be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To without Luke. Luke prepares to burn the Ahch-To Jedi temple and library, but hesitates. <a href="/wiki/Yoda" title="Yoda">Yoda</a>'s ghost appears and destroys the temple by summoning a bolt of <a href="/wiki/Lightning" title="Lightning">lightning</a>, claiming Rey has all she needs to learn, and encourages Luke to learn from his failure.
</p><p>Holdo reveals her plan to discreetly evacuate the remaining Resistance members using small transports. Believing her actions cowardly and risky, Poe leads a mutiny. Finn, Rose, and BB-8 travel to the Canto Bight casino and acquire the help of the hacker <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/DJ_(Star_Wars)" title="DJ (Star Wars)">DJ</a>. They infiltrate Snoke's ship, where all but BB-8 are captured by <a href="/wiki/Captain_Phasma" title="Captain Phasma">Captain Phasma</a>. Meanwhile, Rey lands on the ship, and Kylo brings her to Snoke, who says he facilitated the mental connection between her and Kylo as part of a plan to destroy Luke. Ordered to kill Rey, Kylo instead kills Snoke and defeats Snoke's guards alongside Rey. Rey believes that Kylo has returned to the light side of the Force, but he instead invites her to rule the galaxy with him. Refusing, she fights Kylo for possession of <a href="/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Anakin Skywalker</a>'s lightsaber, which splits in two.
</p><p>Leia recovers and stuns Poe, allowing the evacuation to begin. Holdo remains on the ship to mislead Snoke's fleet as the others flee to an abandoned <a href="/wiki/Rebel_Alliance" title="Rebel Alliance">Rebel Alliance</a> base on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crait" title="Crait">Crait</a>. DJ reveals the Resistance's plan to the First Order, and the evacuation transports are slowly destroyed. Holdo sacrifices herself by ramming Snoke's fleet at lightspeed; Rey escapes in the chaos, while Kylo declares himself Supreme Leader. BB-8 frees Finn and Rose, who escape after defeating Phasma, and join the survivors on Crait. When the First Order arrives, Poe, Finn, and Rose attack with old speeders. Rey and Chewbacca draw the TIE fighters away with the <i>Falcon</i>, while Rose stops Finn from completing a suicide run against the enemy siege cannon, which subsequently penetrates the Resistance fortress.
</p><p>Luke appears and confronts the First Order to enable surviving Resistance members to escape. Kylo orders the First Order's forces to fire on Luke, to no effect. He then engages Luke in a lightsaber duel; upon striking Luke, Kylo realizes he has been fighting a Force projection of him. Rey uses the Force to help the Resistance escape on the <i>Falcon</i>. Luke, exhausted, becomes one with the Force and dies peacefully on Ahch-To. Rey and Leia sense his death, and Leia tells surviving rebels that the Resistance has all it needs to rise again. At Canto Bight, one of the children who helped Finn and Rose escape grabs a broom with the Force and gazes into space.
