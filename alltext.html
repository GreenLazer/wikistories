<p>In 2154, humans have depleted <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>'s natural resources, leading to a severe energy crisis. The Resources Development Administration (RDA for short) mines for a valuable mineral — <a href="/wiki/Unobtainium" title="Unobtainium">unobtanium</a> — on Pandora, a densely forested <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Habitable_moon" title="Habitable moon">habitable moon</a> orbiting the <a href="/wiki/Gas_giant" title="Gas giant">gas giant</a> Polyphemus in the <a href="/wiki/Alpha_Centauri" title="Alpha Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a> star system.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Horwitz2009_11-1"><a href="#cite_note-Horwitz2009-11">[11]</a></sup> Pandora, whose atmosphere is poisonous to humans, is inhabited by the <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere#Naʼvi" title="Pandoran biosphere">Na'vi</a>, a species of 10-foot tall (3.0 m), blue-skinned, <a href="/wiki/Wisdom" title="Wisdom">sapient</a> humanoids<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> that live in harmony with nature and worship a <a href="/wiki/Mother_goddess" title="Mother goddess">mother goddess</a> named Eywa.
</p><p>To explore <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere" title="Pandoran biosphere">Pandora's biosphere</a>, scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called "avatars", operated by genetically matched humans; Jake Sully, a paraplegic former <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_Marine" title="United States Marine">Marine</a>, replaces his deceased identical twin brother as an operator of one. Dr. Grace Augustine, head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement but accepts his assignment as a bodyguard. While protecting the avatars of Grace and fellow scientist Dr. Norm Spellman as they collect biological data, Jake's avatar is attacked by a <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere#Fauna" title="Pandoran biosphere">thanator</a> and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Witnessing an auspicious sign, she takes him to her clan, whereupon Neytiri's mother Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Colonel" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's <a href="/wiki/Private_military_company" title="Private military company">private security force</a>, promises Jake that the company will restore his legs if he gathers information about the Na'vi and the clan's gathering place, a giant tree called Hometree,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Script25_36-0"><a href="#cite_note-Script25-36">[36]</a></sup> which stands above the richest deposit of unobtanium in the area. When Grace learns of this, she transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/outpost" title="wikt:outpost">outpost</a>. Over the following three months, Jake grows to sympathize with the natives. After Jake is initiated into the tribe, he and Neytiri choose each other as mates, and soon afterward, Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he attempts to disable a bulldozer that threatens to destroy a sacred Na'vi site. When Quaritch shows a video recording of Jake's attack on the bulldozer to Administrator Parker Selfridge,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Script8and15_37-0"><a href="#cite_note-Script8and15-37">[37]</a></sup> and another in which Jake admits that the Na'vi will never abandon Hometree, Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed.
</p><p>Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biological_neural_network" title="Biological neural network">biological neural network</a> native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate before commencing the attack. While trying to warn the Na'vi, Jake confesses to being a spy, and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Seeing this, Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, frees Jake, Grace, and Norm, and airlifts them to Grace's outpost, but during the escape Quaritch fires at them, hitting Grace.
</p><p>To regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fictional_universe_in_Avatar#The_Tree_of_Souls" title="Fictional universe in Avatar">Tree of Souls</a> and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can be completed. Supported by the new chief Tsu'tey, Jake speaks to unite the clan and tells them to gather all of the clans to battle against the RDA. Noticing the impending gathering, Quaritch organizes a <a href="/wiki/Preemptive_war" title="Preemptive war">pre-emptive strike</a> against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives. On the eve of battle, Jake prays to Eywa, via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na'vi.
</p><p>During the subsequent battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy; but are rescued when <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Characters_and_wildlife_in_Avatar#Fauna" title="Characters and wildlife in Avatar">Pandoran wildlife</a> unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch, wearing an <a href="/wiki/Mecha" title="Mecha">AMP suit</a>, escapes from his own damaged aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation.
</p><p>With the exceptions of Jake, Norm and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora and sent back to Earth, after which Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.
</p><p>In 1996, treasure hunter Brock Lovett and his team aboard the research vessel <i><a href="/wiki/Akademik_Mstislav_Keldysh" title="Akademik Mstislav Keldysh">Akademik Mstislav Keldysh</a></i> search the wreck of RMS <i>Titanic</i> for a necklace with a rare diamond, the <a href="/wiki/Heart_of_the_Ocean" title="Heart of the Ocean">Heart of the Ocean</a>. They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[Note 1]</a></sup> Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard <i>Keldysh</i> and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard <i>Titanic</i>.
</p><p>In 1912 <a href="/wiki/Southampton" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>, 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fiancé Cal Hockley, and her mother Ruth board the luxurious <i>Titanic</i>. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve their family's financial problems and retain their high-class persona. Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class.
</p><p>Aware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cal's bodyguard, Mr. Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with an iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.
</p><p>Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Lovejoy slips the necklace into Jack's pocket and he and Cal accuse him of theft. Jack is arrested, taken to the <a href="/wiki/Master-at-arms" title="Master-at-arms">master-at-arms</a>' office, and handcuffed to a pipe. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.
</p><p>With the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.
</p><p>After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for only one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of <a href="/wiki/Hypothermia" title="Hypothermia">hypothermia</a><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Carlson_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Carlson-9">[8]</a></sup> but Rose is saved.
</p><p>With Rose hiding from Cal en route, the <a href="/wiki/RMS_Carpathia" title="RMS Carpathia">RMS <i>Carpathia</i></a> takes the survivors to New York City where Rose gives her name as Rose Dawson. Rose says she later read that Cal committed suicide after losing all his money in the <a href="/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929" title="Wall Street Crash of 1929">Wall Street Crash of 1929</a>.
</p><p>Back in the present, Lovett decides to abandon his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of <i>Keldysh</i>, Rose takes out the Heart of the Ocean – in her possession all along – and drops it into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly asleep or has died in her bed,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-comm-sleep-or-dead_10-0"><a href="#cite_note-comm-sleep-or-dead-10">[9]</a></sup> photos on her dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure inspired by the life she wanted to live with Jack.

In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Tesseract_11-0"><a href="#cite_note-Tesseract-11">[N 2]</a></sup> a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. <a href="/wiki/Nick_Fury" title="Nick Fury">Nick Fury</a>, director of the espionage agency <a href="/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D." title="S.H.I.E.L.D.">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a>, and his lieutenant Agent <a href="/wiki/Maria_Hill" title="Maria Hill">Maria Hill</a> arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. <a href="/wiki/Erik_Selvig" title="Erik Selvig">Erik Selvig</a> is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent <a href="/wiki/Phil_Coulson" title="Phil Coulson">Phil Coulson</a> explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a <a href="/wiki/Wormhole" title="Wormhole">wormhole</a>, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a few other agents, including <a href="/wiki/Hawkeye_(comics)" title="Hawkeye (comics)">Clint Barton</a>, to aid him in his getaway.
</p><p>In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the "<a href="/wiki/Avengers_(comics)" title="Avengers (comics)">Avengers Initiative</a>". Agent <a href="/wiki/Black_Widow_(Natasha_Romanova)" title="Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)">Natasha Romanoff</a> is sent to <a href="/wiki/Kolkata" title="Kolkata">Calcutta</a> to recruit <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Banner_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)" title="Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)">Dr. Bruce Banner</a> to trace the Tesseract through its <a href="/wiki/Gamma_ray" title="Gamma ray">gamma radiation</a> emissions.

</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Stuttgart" title="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>, Barton steals <a href="/wiki/Iridium" title="Iridium">iridium</a> needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., <a href="/wiki/Thor_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)" title="Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)">Thor</a>, his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the <a href="/wiki/Helicarrier" title="Helicarrier">Helicarrier</a>. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.
</p><p>The Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk falls to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above <a href="/wiki/Stark_Tower" title="Stark Tower">Stark Tower</a> to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.
</p><p>Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's location. Banner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians. The Hulk finds Loki and beats him into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at <a href="/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan" title="Midtown Manhattan">Midtown Manhattan</a>. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed.

Brian begins to accustom himself to life as a father, while Dom tries to help Letty Ortiz regain her memory. Meanwhile, Owen's older brother, Deckard Shaw, breaks into the secure hospital that the comatose Owen is being held in and swears vengeance against Dom and his team, before breaking into Luke Hobbs' <a href="/wiki/Diplomatic_Security_Service" title="Diplomatic Security Service">Diplomatic Security Service</a> (DSS) office to extract profiles of Dom's crew. After revealing his identity, Shaw engages Hobbs in a fight, and escapes when he detonates a bomb that severely injures Hobbs. Dom later learns from his sister Mia that she is pregnant again and convinces her to tell Brian. However, a bomb, disguised in a package sent from <a href="/wiki/Tokyo" title="Tokyo">Tokyo</a>, explodes and destroys the Toretto house just seconds after Han, a member of Dom's team, is killed by Shaw in Tokyo.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-9"><a href="#cite_note-9">[N 2]</a></sup> Dom later visits Hobbs in a hospital, where he learns that Shaw is a rogue special forces assassin seeking to avenge his brother. Dom then travels to Tokyo to claim Han's body, and meets and races Sean Boswell, a friend of Han's who gives him personal items found at Han's crash site.
</p><p>Back at Han's funeral in <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, Dom notices a car observing them, and after a chase, confronts its driver, who is revealed to be Shaw.

Nobody says that he will assist Dom in stopping Shaw if he helps him obtain God's Eye, a computer program that uses digital devices to track down a person, and save its creator, a hacker named Ramsey, from a mercenary named Mose Jakande.

With God's Eye near <a href="/wiki/Repeater" title="Repeater">telecommunications repeaters</a>, the team tracks down Shaw, who is waiting at a remote factory. Dom, Brian, Nobody and his team attempt to capture Shaw, but are ambushed by Jakande and his men and forced to flee while Jakande obtains God's Eye. At his own request, the injured Nobody is left behind to be evacuated by helicopter while Brian and Dom continue without him. To reduce their disadvantage, the crew returns to Los Angeles to fight Shaw, Jakande and his men. Meanwhile, Brian promises Mia that once they deal with Shaw, he will retire and fully dedicate himself to their family.

Hobbs, seeing the team in trouble, leaves the hospital and destroys the drone with an ambulance. Brian engages Jakande's henchman Kiet and throws him down an elevator shaft before hijacking a signal repeater tower, allowing Ramsey to regain control of God's Eye and shut it down. Dom and Shaw engage in a one-on-one brawl on top of a public parking garage, before Jakande intervenes and attacks them both. Shaw is defeated when part of the parking garage collapses beneath him. Dom then launches his vehicle at Jakande's helicopter, tossing Shaw's bag of grenades onto its skids, before injuring himself when his car lands and crashes. Hobbs then shoots the bag of grenades from ground level, destroying the helicopter and killing Jakande. Dom is pulled from the wreckage of his car, believed to be dead. As Letty cradles Dom's body in her arms, she reveals that she has regained her memories, and that she remembers their wedding. Dom regains consciousness soon after, remarking, "It's about time".
</p><p>Shaw is taken into custody by Hobbs and locked away in a secret, high-security prison. At a beach, Brian and Mia play with their son while Dom, Letty, Roman, Tej, and Ramsey observe, acknowledging that Brian is better off retired with his family.

Escaping with the scepter, Ultron uses the resources in Strucker's Sokovia base to upgrade his rudimentary body and build an army of robot drones. Having killed Strucker, he recruits the Maximoffs, who hold Stark responsible for their parents' deaths by his company's weapons, and goes to the base of arms dealer <a href="/wiki/Klaw_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Klaw (Marvel Comics)">Ulysses Klaue</a> in <a href="/wiki/Johannesburg" title="Johannesburg">Johannesburg</a> to obtain <a href="/wiki/Wakanda" title="Wakanda">Wakandan</a> <a href="/wiki/Vibranium" title="Vibranium">vibranium</a>.

They use her synthetic-tissue technology, vibranium, and the scepter's gem to craft a new body. As Ultron uploads himself into the body, Wanda is able to read his mind; discovering his plan for human extinction, the Maximoffs turn against Ultron. Rogers, Romanoff, and Barton find Ultron and retrieve the synthetic body, but Ultron captures Romanoff.
</p><p>The Avengers fight amongst themselves when Stark secretly uploads J.A.R.V.I.S.—who is still operational after hiding from Ultron inside the Internet—into the synthetic body. Thor returns to help activate the body, explaining that the gem on its brow—one of the six <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Infinity_Stones" title="Infinity Stones">Infinity Stones</a>, the most powerful objects in existence—was part of his vision. This "<a href="/wiki/Vision_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Vision (Marvel Comics)">Vision</a>" and the Maximoffs accompany the Avengers to Sokovia, where Ultron has used the remaining vibranium to build a machine to lift a large part of the capital city skyward, intending to crash it into the ground to cause global extinction.

</p><p>Thousands of years ago, five African tribes war over a meteorite containing <a href="/wiki/Vibranium" title="Vibranium">vibranium</a>. One warrior ingests a "heart-shaped herb" affected by the metal and gains superhuman abilities, becoming the first "Black Panther". He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of <a href="/wiki/Wakanda" title="Wakanda">Wakanda</a>. Over centuries, the Wakandans use the vibranium to develop advanced technology and isolate themselves from the world by posing as a <a href="/wiki/Third_World" title="Third World">Third World</a> country. In 1992, Wakanda's King <a href="/wiki/T%27Chaka" title="T'Chaka">T'Chaka</a> visits his brother N'Jobu, who is working undercover in <a href="/wiki/Oakland,_California" title="Oakland, California">Oakland, California</a>.

At the ceremony, the Jabari Tribe's leader <a href="/wiki/Man-Ape" title="Man-Ape">M'Baku</a> challenges T'Challa for the crown in ritual combat. T'Challa defeats M'Baku and persuades him to yield rather than die.
</p><p>When Klaue and his accomplice <a href="/wiki/Erik_Killmonger" title="Erik Killmonger">Erik Stevens</a> steal a Wakandan artifact from a London museum, T'Challa's friend and Okoye's lover <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/W%27Kabi" title="W'Kabi">W'Kabi</a> urges him to bring Klaue back alive.

Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue as Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him.
</p><p>While Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, the latter attacked Zuri and forced T'Chaka to kill him. T'Chaka ordered Zuri to lie that N'Jobu had disappeared and left behind N'Jobu's American son in order to maintain the lie. This boy grew up to be Stevens, a U.S. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Black_ops" title="Black ops">black ops</a> soldier who adopted the name "Killmonger". Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity to be N'Jadaka and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat, where he kills Zuri, defeats T'Challa, and hurls him over a waterfall to his presumed death. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first. Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.
</p><p>Nakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit. W'Kabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down planes carrying the vibranium weapons. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated.
</p><p>T'Challa establishes an outreach center at the building where N'Jobu died, to be run by Nakia and Shuri. In a mid-credits scene, T'Challa appears before the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a> to reveal Wakanda's true nature to the world.

</p><p>Harry learns from Snape's memories that while Snape despised Harry's late father <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/James_Potter_(character)" title="James Potter (character)">James</a>, who bullied him, he loved his late mother <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lily_Potter" title="Lily Potter">Lily</a>. Following her death, Snape worked with <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> to protect Harry from Voldemort due to his love for Lily. Harry also learns that Dumbledore was dying and wished for Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe he saw in the woods that led him to the sword was conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him; he must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within himself. Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort in the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts#Forbidden_Forest" title="Hogwarts">Forbidden Forest</a>. Voldemort casts the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Avada_Kedavra" title="Avada Kedavra">Killing Curse</a> upon Harry, who finds himself in <a href="/wiki/Limbo" title="Limbo">limbo</a>. Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's curse. Harry returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort.
</p><p>Voldemort announces Harry's apparent death to everyone at Hogwarts and demands their surrender. As Neville gives a defiant response and draws the sword from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sorting_Hat" title="Sorting Hat">Sorting Hat</a>, Harry reveals he is still alive; the Malfoys and many <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> abandon Voldemort. While Harry confronts Voldemort in a duel throughout the castle, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Molly_Weasley" title="Molly Weasley">Molly Weasley</a> kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall and Neville decapitates Nagini, making Voldemort mortal. Harry and Voldemort's fight ends with Voldemort's own Killing Curse rebounding and obliterating him. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that the Elder Wand recognised him as its true master after he disarmed Draco, who had earlier disarmed its previous owner, Dumbledore. Harry destroys the Elder Wand rather than claim it.
</p><p>Nineteen years later, Harry, <a href="/wiki/Ginny_Weasley" title="Ginny Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a>, Ron, Hermione, and Draco proudly watch their own children leave for Hogwarts at <a href="/wiki/London_King%27s_Cross_railway_station" title="London King's Cross railway station">King's Cross station</a>.

Disillusioned by his failure to train Kylo as a <a href="/wiki/Jedi" title="Jedi">Jedi</a>, and under self-imposed exile, Luke refuses to help and says that the Jedi should end. Meanwhile, the First Order uses a device to track the Resistance, and attacks them. Leia's son <a href="/wiki/Kylo_Ren" title="Kylo Ren">Kylo Ren</a> hesitates to fire on the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mother's presence, but his wingmen destroy the bridge, killing most of the Resistance's leaders. Leia is sucked into <a href="/wiki/Outer_space" title="Outer space">space</a>, but survives by using <a href="/wiki/The_Force" title="The Force">the Force</a>.
</p><p>Encouraged by R2-D2, Luke decides to train Rey as a Jedi. Rey and Kylo begin communicating through the Force, puzzling them both. After Kylo tells Rey what happened between him and Luke that caused him to choose the dark side, Luke confesses that he momentarily contemplated killing Kylo upon sensing that <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Leader_Snoke" title="Supreme Leader Snoke">Snoke</a> was corrupting him; this prompted Kylo to destroy Luke's new Jedi Order. Convinced that Kylo can be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To. Luke prepares to burn the Jedi library, but hesitates. <a href="/wiki/Yoda" title="Yoda">Yoda</a>'s Force ghost appears and destroys the library by summoning a bolt of <a href="/wiki/Lightning" title="Lightning">lightning</a>, saying Rey has all she needs to learn, and encouraging Luke to learn from his failure.

Finn and Rose infiltrate Snoke's ship—as Rey also arrives—but are captured by <a href="/wiki/Captain_Phasma" title="Captain Phasma">Captain Phasma</a>. Kylo brings Rey to Snoke, who says he facilitated the connection between her and Kylo as part of a plan to destroy Luke. Meanwhile, new Resistance leader <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vice_Admiral_Holdo" title="Vice Admiral Holdo">Vice Admiral Holdo</a> reveals her plan to evacuate the remaining Resistance members using small transports. Believing her actions to be cowardly and futile, Poe leads a mutiny. Leia recovers and stuns Poe, allowing the evacuation to begin. Holdo remains on the ship to mislead Snoke's fleet as the others flee to an abandoned base on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crait" title="Crait">Crait</a>. In a bargain for his freedom, DJ reveals the Resistance's plan to the First Order, and the evacuation transports are slowly destroyed.
</p><p>Ordered to kill Rey, Kylo instead kills Snoke and defeats his guards alongside Rey. Rey hopes that Kylo has returned to the light side, but he instead asks her to rule the galaxy with him. Refusing, she and Kylo each use the Force to try to take <a href="/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Anakin Skywalker</a>'s lightsaber, splitting it in two. Holdo sacrifices herself by ramming into Snoke's flagship at lightspeed, crippling it. Rey escapes in the chaos, while Kylo declares himself Supreme Leader. BB-8 frees Finn and Rose; they defeat Phasma and join the survivors on Crait. When the First Order arrives, Poe, Finn, and Rose attack with old speeders. Rey and Chewbacca draw <a href="/wiki/TIE_fighter" title="TIE fighter">TIE fighters</a> away in the <i>Falcon</i>, while Rose stops Finn from completing a suicide run against the enemy siege cannon, which subsequently penetrates the Resistance fortress.
</p><p>Luke appears and confronts the First Order to enable the surviving Resistance to escape. Kylo orders the First Order's forces to fire on Luke, to no effect. He then engages Luke in a lightsaber duel; upon striking Luke, Kylo realizes he has been fighting a Force projection. Rey helps the remaining Resistance escape on the <i>Falcon</i>. Luke, exhausted, dies peacefully on Ahch-To, becoming one with the Force. Rey and Leia sense his death, and Leia tells her that the Resistance has all it needs to rise again. At Canto Bight, one of the stablehand children moves a broom with the Force and gazes into space.

</p><p>A <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate" title="United States Senate">U.S. Senate</a> hearing in <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> debates whether Isla Nublar's dinosaurs should be saved from an impending volcanic eruption. Mathematician <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Dr._Ian_Malcolm" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Dr. Ian Malcolm</a> testifies that the dinosaurs should be allowed to perish to correct <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#John_Hammond" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">John Hammond</a>'s mistake of <a href="/wiki/Cloning" title="Cloning">cloning</a> them. Meanwhile, Jurassic World's former operations manager, Claire Dearing, has established the Dinosaur Protection Group to save the animals. After the Senate rules against rescuing the dinosaurs, Hammond's former partner, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Sir_Benjamin_Lockwood" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Benjamin Lockwood</a>, summons Claire to his <a href="/wiki/Northern_California" title="Northern California">Northern California</a> estate. Lockwood and his aide, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Eli_Mills" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Eli Mills</a>, reveal a plan to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary. Claire is needed to reactivate the park's dinosaur <a href="/wiki/GPS_wildlife_tracking" title="GPS wildlife tracking">tracking system</a> to locate the animals, particularly Blue, the last surviving <i><a href="/wiki/Velociraptor" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a></i>. Though now estranged, Claire recruits Owen Grady, Jurassic World's former <i>Velociraptor</i> trainer and Blue's alpha, to help capture her.
</p><p>On Isla Nublar, Claire and former park technician <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Franklin_Webb" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Franklin Webb</a> reactivate the online <a href="/wiki/GPS_wildlife_tracking" title="GPS wildlife tracking">tracking system</a>. Owen, paleo-veterinarian <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Dr._Zia_Rodriguez" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Zia Rodriguez</a>, and a mercenary team led by <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Ken_Wheatley" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Ken Wheatley</a>, track and find Blue. The encounter escalates, resulting in Blue being shot and Wheatley <a href="/wiki/Sedative" title="Sedative">tranquilizing</a> Owen. 
Wheatley then abandons Owen, Claire, and Franklin on the island while forcibly taking Zia to treat Blue's injury. The mercenary ship, loaded with the captured dinosaurs, departs for the <a href="/wiki/Contiguous_United_States" title="Contiguous United States">U.S. mainland</a> as the animals left behind die in the eruption. Claire, Franklin, and Owen sneak aboard the ship and help Zia <a href="/wiki/Blood_transfusion" title="Blood transfusion">transfuse</a> Blue with <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> blood. The group realize that the captured dinosaurs are being transported to an unidentified location for an unknown purpose.
</p><p>At the estate, Lockwood's orphaned pre-teen granddaughter <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Maisie_Lockwood" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Maisie</a> overhears Mills and auctioneer <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Gunnar_Eversol" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Gunnar Eversol</a> secretly planning to auction the captured dinosaurs on the <a href="/wiki/Black_market" title="Black market">black market</a>.

Wu wants Blue's DNA to create an enhanced <i>Indoraptor</i> that is obedient to commands, unaware that Blue's blood has been contaminated. After Maisie informs Lockwood about the auction, he confronts Mills, who murders him. Maisie is later revealed to have been cloned from Lockwood's deceased daughter and is the reason John Hammond, who opposed <a href="/wiki/Human_cloning" title="Human cloning">human cloning</a>, ended their association.
</p><p>The dinosaurs are transported to Lockwood's estate and caged. Zia and Franklin narrowly evade capture, but Owen and Claire are apprehended. Owen incites a <i><a href="/wiki/Stygimoloch" title="Stygimoloch">Stygimoloch</a></i> into breaking open their cell. They find Maisie, who leads them to the auction where the <i>Indoraptor</i> is being sold despite Wu's protests that it is a prototype. Owen disrupts the proceedings by luring the <i>Stygimoloch</i> into the room. In the ensuing chaos, Wheatley tranquilizes the <i>Indoraptor</i> and extracts a tooth as a trophy, but it feigns sedation killing him, Eversol, and others as it escapes. The <i>Indoraptor</i> then hunts Owen, Claire, and Maisie throughout the mansion. Zia releases Blue, who attacks the <i>Indoraptor</i>, causing it to fall through a glass roof to its death.
</p><p>When a <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_cyanide" title="Hydrogen cyanide">hydrogen cyanide</a> gas leak threatens the caged dinosaurs, Maisie frees them, despite Owen's objections. Mills attempts to flee with the <i>Indominus rex</i> bone but is devoured by the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, which tramples the bone. Owen, Claire, Maisie, Zia, and Franklin safely escape, while Blue and the other released dinosaurs flee the estate grounds.
</p><p>In a new U.S. Senate hearing, Dr. Malcolm declares the beginning of a Neo-Jurassic Age, where humans and dinosaurs must learn to coexist. The closing scenes depict freed dinosaurs roaming wilderness and outer urban areas.
</p><p>Princess <a href="/wiki/Elsa_(Frozen)" title="Elsa (Frozen)">Elsa</a> of Arendelle possesses paranormal powers that allows her to control and create ice and snow, often using it to play with her younger sister, <a href="/wiki/Anna_(Frozen)" title="Anna (Frozen)">Anna</a>. After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents, the King and Queen, take both siblings to a colony of trolls led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna, but alters her memories to remove traces of Elsa's magic, warning Elsa that she must learn to control her powers. He also states that fear will be Elsa's greatest enemy. The King and Queen isolate both sisters within the castle. Elsa shuts Anna out, causing a rift between them. Unable to control it, Elsa can only suppress her power, causing her to  become more insecure. When the sisters are teenagers, their parents die at sea during a storm.
</p><p>When Elsa turns 21, she is to be crowned queen of Arendelle. She is terrified that the kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear her. The castle gates open to the public and visiting dignitaries for the first time in years. Among them is the scheming Duke of Weselton and the dashing <a href="/wiki/Hans_(Frozen)" title="Hans (Frozen)">Prince Hans</a> of the Southern Isles, the latter of whom Anna falls in love with <a href="/wiki/Love_at_first_sight" title="Love at first sight">at first sight</a>. Elsa's <a href="/wiki/Coronation" title="Coronation">coronation</a> happens without a hitch, but she still remains distant from Anna. When Hans proposes to Anna, Elsa objects, accidentally unleashing her powers before the court; the Duke brands her a monster. Elsa flees to the North Mountain, where she builds a palace of ice in which to live a <a href="/wiki/Hermit" title="Hermit">hermit</a> life. In the process, however, her suppressed magic engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter.
</p><p>Anna ventures out to find Elsa and end the winter, leaving Hans in command. She gets lost, collecting supplies at Wandering Oaken's shop. She meets an <a href="/wiki/Iceman_(occupation)" title="Iceman (occupation)">ice harvester</a> named <a href="/wiki/Kristoff_(Frozen)" title="Kristoff (Frozen)">Kristoff</a> and his <a href="/wiki/Reindeer" title="Reindeer">reindeer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sven_(Frozen)" title="Sven (Frozen)">Sven</a>, convincing them to take her to the mountains. An attack by wolves leads to Kristoff's sleigh being destroyed. On foot, they meet <a href="/wiki/Olaf_(Frozen)" title="Olaf (Frozen)">Olaf</a>, a cheerful <a href="/wiki/Snowman" title="Snowman">snowman</a> brought to life unknowingly by Elsa, who offers to lead them to her. When Anna's horse returns to Arendelle, Hans sets out to find Anna and Elsa, accompanied by the Duke's minions, who have secret orders to kill Elsa.
</p><p>Reaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa, but when she reveals what has become of Arendelle, Elsa becomes upset, saying that she cannot undo it, and accidentally freezes Anna's heart, poisoning her. She then makes a giant snow monster named Marshmallow, who chases Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf away.  Realizing the effects of Elsa's spell on Anna, Kristoff takes her to the trolls, his adoptive family. Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless "an act of true love" reverses the spell. Kristoff races Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss. Hans and his men reach Elsa's palace, defeating Marshmallow and capturing Elsa. Anna is delivered to Hans but, rather than kissing her, Hans instead reveals that he has actually been plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters. Hans locks Anna in a room to die, and then manipulates the dignitaries into believing that Elsa killed her. He orders the queen's execution, only to discover she has escaped her detention cell.
</p><p>Olaf frees Anna, and they venture into the <a href="/wiki/Blizzard" title="Blizzard">blizzard</a> outside to meet Kristoff, whom Olaf reveals is in love with her. Hans confronts Elsa outside, claiming that she killed Anna, causing Elsa to break down. Anna spots Hans about to kill Elsa; she leaps in the way and freezes solid, stopping Hans. Devastated, Elsa hugs and mourns over her sister, who <a href="/wiki/Thaw_(weather)" title="Thaw (weather)">thaws</a> out, her heroism constituting "an act of true love". Realizing that love is the key to controlling her magic, Elsa ends the winter and gives Olaf his own snow flurry to survive the warmer climate. Both Hans and the Duke are arrested and exiled from the kingdom. Anna gives Kristoff a new sleigh, and the two kiss. Both sisters are reunited and Elsa promises never to lock the castle gates again.
</p><p>A beautiful enchantress disguised as an old beggar woman arrives at a castle during a ball and offers the host, a cruel and selfish prince, a rose in return for shelter from a storm. When he refuses, she reveals her identity. To punish the prince for his lack of compassion, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects, then erases the castle, the prince and his servants from the memories of their loved ones. She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that the curse will only be broken if he learns to love another, and earn their love in return, before the last petal falls.
</p><p>Some years later, in the small town of Villeneuve, Belle, the book-loving daughter of a <a href="/wiki/Music_box" title="Music box">music box</a> maker and artist Maurice, dreams of adventure and brushes off advances from Gaston, an arrogant former soldier. On his way to a convention and lost in the forest, Maurice seeks refuge in the Beast's castle, but the Beast imprisons him for stealing a rose from his garden as a gift to Belle. When Maurice's horse returns without him, Belle ventures out in search for him, and finds him locked in the castle dungeon. The Beast agrees to let her take Maurice's place.
</p><p>Belle befriends the castle's servants, who invite her to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the Beast scares her into the woods. She is ambushed by a pack of wolves, but the Beast rescues her, and is injured in the process. As Belle nurses his wounds, a friendship develops between them. The Beast shows Belle a gift from the enchantress, a book that transports readers wherever they want. Belle uses the book to visit her childhood home in Paris, where she discovers a <a href="/wiki/Plague_doctor_costume" title="Plague doctor costume">plague doctor mask</a> and realizes that she and her father were forced to leave when her mother succumbed to the <a href="/wiki/Bubonic_plague" title="Bubonic plague">plague</a>.
</p><p>In Villeneuve, Maurice fails to convince the other villagers of the Beast and Belle's imprisonment. Gaston, seeing rescuing Belle as an opportunity to win her hand in marriage, agrees to help Maurice. When Maurice learns of his ulterior motive and rejects him, Gaston abandons him to be eaten by the wolves. Maurice is rescued by the hermit Agathe, but when he tells the townsfolk of Gaston's crime and is unable to provide solid evidence, Gaston convinces them to send Maurice to an insane asylum.
</p><p>After sharing a romantic dance with the Beast, Belle discovers her father's predicament using a magic mirror. The Beast releases her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror to remember him with. At Villeneuve, Belle reveals the Beast in the mirror to the townsfolk, proving her father's sanity. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, a jealous Gaston claims she has been charmed by dark magic, and has her thrown into the asylum carriage with her father. He rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to slay the Beast before he curses the whole village. Maurice and Belle escape, and Belle rushes back to the castle.
</p><p>During the battle, Gaston abandons his companion LeFou, who then sides with the servants to fend off the villagers. Gaston attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too depressed to fight back, but regains his spirit upon seeing Belle return. He defeats Gaston, but spares his life before reuniting with Belle. Ungrateful and unrepentant, Gaston fatally shoots the Beast from a bridge, but it collapses when the castle crumbles, and he falls to his death. The Beast dies as the last petal falls, and the servants become inanimate. As Belle tearfully professes her love to the Beast, Agathe reveals herself as the enchantress and undoes the curse, repairing the crumbling castle, and restoring the Beast's and servants' human forms and the villagers' memories. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the kingdom, where they dance happily.
</p><p>Following the events of the <a href="/wiki/The_Incredibles" title="The Incredibles">first film</a>, the <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Incredibles_characters#The_Parr_Family" title="List of The Incredibles characters">Incredibles</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Incredibles_characters#Frozone" title="List of The Incredibles characters">Lucius Best a.k.a Frozone</a> battle the <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Incredibles_characters#The_Underminer" title="List of The Incredibles characters">Underminer</a>, who has just appeared to terrorize Municiberg. Though they prevent the destruction of City Hall, they are unable to stop him from robbing a bank and escaping. The collateral damage caused by the incident outrages the government and prompts them to shut down the Superhero Relocation Program, leaving the Parrs without financial assistance. <a href="/wiki/Violet_Parr" title="Violet Parr">Violet</a>'s love interest <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Incredibles_characters#Tony_Rydinger" title="List of The Incredibles characters">Tony Rydinger</a> also discovers her superhero identity, forcing agent <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Incredibles_characters#Rick_Dicker" title="List of The Incredibles characters">Rick Dicker</a> to erase his memory of her. Frozone informs <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Incredibles_characters#Bob_Parr_(Mr._Incredible)" title="List of The Incredibles characters">Mr. Incredible</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Helen_Parr_(Pixar_character)" title="Helen Parr (Pixar character)">Elastigirl</a> of an offer from <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Incredibles_characters#Winston_Deavor" title="List of The Incredibles characters">Winston Deavor</a>, a wealthy businessman. He and his sister <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Incredibles_characters#Evelyn_Deavor" title="List of The Incredibles characters">Evelyn</a> propose sending the heroes on secret missions which will be recorded and publicized to regain public trust in superheroes.
</p><p>Due to Mr. Incredible's tendency to accidentally cause collateral damage, Winston chooses Elastigirl for the initial missions. While Elastigirl is away, Bob struggles with his new role as a stay-at-home parent: <a href="/wiki/Dash_Parr" title="Dash Parr">Dash</a> has trouble with math homework, Violet becomes withdrawn after Tony fails to show up for their first date due to his memory wipe, and <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Incredibles_characters#Jack-Jack_Parr" title="List of The Incredibles characters">Jack-Jack</a> wreaks havoc with his burgeoning superpowers. He takes Jack-Jack to <a href="/wiki/Edna_Mode" title="Edna Mode">Edna Mode</a>, who develops a suit that helps control his abilities. Meanwhile, on her missions, Elastigirl encounters a mysterious supervillain called the Screenslaver, who projects <a href="/wiki/Hypnosis" title="Hypnosis">hypnotic</a> images via TV screens. She tracks him down to his hideout in an apartment building, and unmasks him as a pizza deliveryman who claims to have no recollection of his actions.
</p><p>At a party celebrating the Screenslaver's arrest, Winston announces a summit of world leaders to legalize superheroes, hosted aboard his luxury hydrofoil yacht, the <i>Everjust</i>. Unsettled by the ease with which she captured the Screenslaver, Elastigirl realizes that he was being controlled by a pair of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mind_control" title="Mind control">mind-control</a> goggles. Evelyn forces the goggles onto Elastigirl, revealing herself to be the mastermind behind the Screenslaver. Evelyn explains that she has hated superheroes since <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Incredibles_characters#List_of_known_superheroes" title="List of The Incredibles characters">Gazerbeam and Fironic</a> failed to save her father's murder by burglars. The event led her to conclude that superheroes have taken independence from society, who in turn had become dangerously over-reliant on superheroes. She plans to sabotage her brother's summit and cause a catastrophe that will tarnish the reputation of superheroes, ensuring they remain outlawed forever. Using Elastigirl, she lures Bob into a trap, then sends another group of hypnotised superheroes previously invited to the summit to subdue the Parr children. Frozone tries to protect them, but is overwhelmed and placed under Evelyn's control.
</p><p>Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack escape with the help of the Incredibile, a high-tech car once owned by Mr. Incredible, and reach Winston's yacht. On board, the hypnotized Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone recite a vindictive manifesto on air to paint superheroes as a threat. They subdue the ship's crew, aim the hydrofoil at Municiberg, and destroy the controls. The Parr children reach them, and Jack-Jack removes Elastigirl’s goggles. She in turn frees Mr. Incredible and Frozone. The Incredibles and Frozone release the other mind-controlled superheroes by destroying their goggles, then work together to prevent the <i>Everjust</i> from crashing into the city by turning the ship. Evelyn attempts to escape in a jet, but is apprehended by Elastigirl and arrested. Due to their actions, superheroes around the world regain legal status.
</p><p>Later, Tony accompanies Violet to a movie with the family. When the Parrs spot a high-speed pursuit of gunmen by the <a href="/wiki/Police" title="Police">police</a>, Violet leaves Tony at the theater, and the Incredibles give chase in a remodeled red Incredibile.

After escaping, Deckard and Hobbs are recruited by intelligence operative <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Fast_and_the_Furious_characters#Mr._Nobody" title="List of The Fast and the Furious characters">Mr. Nobody</a> and his protégé to help the team find Dom and capture Cipher. Deckard reveals that Cipher had hired his brother Owen Shaw to steal the Nightshade device and Mose Jakande to steal God's Eye, Ramsey's software program. The team tracks Dom and Cipher to their very location just as the latter two attack the base and steal God's Eye. When Dom questions Cipher's motives, she reveals that she has been holding hostage Dom's ex-lover and DSS agent Elena Neves—as well as their son, of whose existence Dom was previously unaware. Elena tells Dom that she wanted him to decide the child's first name, having already given him the middle name Marcos.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, Cipher sends Dom to retrieve a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_football" title="Nuclear football">nuclear football</a> held by the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)" title="Ministry of Defence (Russia)">Russian Minister of Defence</a>. Prior to the theft, Dom briefly evades Cipher—with the help of Raldo—and persuades Deckard and Owen's mother, Magdalene Shaw, to help him. Cipher hacks into the electronics systems of a large number of cars, causing them to drive automatically and taking out the convoy so that Dom can take the football. The team intercepts Dom, but Dom escapes, shooting and apparently killing Deckard in the process. Letty catches up to Dom, but is ambushed and nearly killed by Cipher's enforcer, Connor Rhodes, before Dom rescues her. In retaliation, Cipher has Rhodes execute Elena in front of Dom.
</p><p>Dom infiltrates a base in Russia to use the EMP device to disable their security and then to disable a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_submarine" title="Nuclear submarine">nuclear submarine</a>, enabling Cipher to hijack it and attempt to use its arsenal to trigger a nuclear war. They are once again intercepted by the team, who attempt to shut down the sub, and then drive out toward the gates that would prevent the sub from leaving into open waters. Meanwhile, Deckard, whose death was faked, teams up with Owen, and at Magdalene's behest, infiltrates Cipher's plane to rescue Dom's son. Once Deckard reports that the child is safe, Dom turns on Cipher and kills Rhodes, avenging Elena's death, before rejoining his team. Outraged, Cipher fires an <a href="/wiki/Infrared_homing" title="Infrared homing">infrared homing</a> missile at Dom, but he breaks away from his team and maneuvers around it, causing the missile to hit the submarine instead. The team quickly forms a vehicular blockade around Dom, shielding him from the ensuing explosion. Deckard reaches the front of the plane and confronts Cipher, who jumps from the plane with a parachute.
</p><p>Mr. Nobody and his protégé visit Dom and his team in New York City to report that Cipher is still at large in <a href="/wiki/Athens" title="Athens">Athens</a>. Hobbs is offered his DSS job back, but he declines in order to spend more time with his daughter. Deckard delivers Dom his son, putting his differences aside with Dom and Hobbs. Dom names his son Brian, after his friend and brother-in-law <a href="/wiki/Brian_O%27Conner" title="Brian O'Conner">Brian O'Conner</a>, and they celebrate.
</p><p>At a <a href="/wiki/New_Year%27s_Eve" title="New Year's Eve">New Year's Eve</a> party in 1999, <a href="/wiki/Tony_Stark_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)" title="Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)">Tony Stark</a> meets scientist <a href="/wiki/Maya_Hansen" title="Maya Hansen">Maya Hansen</a>, the inventor of an experimental regenerative treatment named <a href="/wiki/Extremis" title="Extremis">Extremis</a> that allows recovery from crippling injuries.

In December 2012, seven months after the <a href="/wiki/The_Avengers_(2012_film)" title="The Avengers (2012 film)">battle of New York</a>, Stark is suffering from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/PTSD" title="PTSD">Post Traumatic Stress Disorder</a>, and is having frequent panic and anxiety attacks due to his experiences during the alien invasion and subsequent battle.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Timeline_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Timeline-9">[N 2]</a></sup> Restless, he has built dozens of new <a href="/wiki/Iron_Man%27s_armor_in_other_media#Live_action" title="Iron Man's armor in other media">Iron Man suits</a>, creating friction with his girlfriend <a href="/wiki/Pepper_Potts" title="Pepper Potts">Pepper Potts</a>.
</p><p>A string of bombings claimed by a terrorist known as the <a href="/wiki/Mandarin_(comics)" title="Mandarin (comics)">Mandarin</a> has left intelligence agencies bewildered by a lack of forensic evidence. Stark's security chief <a href="/wiki/Happy_Hogan_(comics)" title="Happy Hogan (comics)">Happy Hogan</a> is badly injured in one such attack, prompting Stark to boldly issue a televised threat to the Mandarin, revealing his home address in the process. The Mandarin sends gunship helicopters to destroy Stark's home. Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives the attack with Potts. Stark escapes in an experimental new Iron Man suit, which his <a href="/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> <a href="/wiki/Edwin_Jarvis" title="Edwin Jarvis">J.A.R.V.I.S.</a> pilots to rural Tennessee, following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's new armor is not fully functional, and lacks sufficient power to return to California, leaving the world to believe him dead.
</p><p>Teaming with Harley, a 10-year-old boy, Stark investigates the remains of a local explosion bearing the hallmarks of a Mandarin attack. He discovers the "bombings" were triggered by soldiers subjected to Extremis whose bodies explosively rejected the treatment. These explosions were falsely attributed to a terrorist plot in order to cover up Extremis's flaws. Stark witnesses Extremis first hand when Mandarin agents <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ellen_Brandt" title="Ellen Brandt">Brandt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Coldblood" title="Coldblood">Savin</a> attack him. Meanwhile, Killian resurfaces and kidnaps Potts and Hansen. American intelligence agencies continue to search for the Mandarin's location, with <a href="/wiki/War_Machine" title="War Machine">James Rhodes</a>—the former War Machine, now re-branded as the <a href="/wiki/Iron_Patriot" title="Iron Patriot">Iron Patriot</a>—lured into a trap to steal his Iron Man-like armor.
</p><p>With Harley's help, Stark traces the Mandarin to <a href="/wiki/Miami" title="Miami">Miami</a> and infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. Inside he discovers the Mandarin is actually an English actor named <a href="/wiki/Trevor_Slattery" title="Trevor Slattery">Trevor Slattery</a>, who is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image. Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin behind Slattery's cover. After capturing Stark, Killian reveals that he has subjected Potts to Extremis in the hope that Stark will help fix Extremis's flaws while trying to save her. Killian fatally shoots Hansen when she tries to stop him.
</p><p>Stark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard <a href="/wiki/Air_Force_One" title="Air Force One">Air Force One</a>, using the Iron Patriot armor. Stark saves some surviving passengers and crew but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. They trace Killian to an impounded damaged oil tanker where Killian intends to kill Ellis on live television. The Vice President will become a puppet leader, following Killian's orders in exchange for Extremis to cure his young daughter's disability. On the platform, Stark works to save Potts, as Rhodes goes after the President. Stark summons his remaining Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Rhodes secures the President and takes him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived the Extremis procedure; before he can save her, a rig collapses around them and she falls to her apparent death. Stark fights Killian and traps him in an Iron Man suit that he self-destructs, but fails to kill him. Potts, whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive her fall, intervenes and kills Killian.
</p><p>Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy each Iron Man suit as a sign of his devotion to Potts, while the Vice President and Slattery are arrested. With Stark's help, Potts' Extremis effects are stabilized, and Stark promises to scale back his life as Iron Man, undergoing surgery to remove the shrapnel near his heart and throwing his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea. He muses that, even without the technology, he will always be Iron Man.

With the villains still searching for him, Kevin sneaks into Scarlet's castle to steal weapons. But right before the villains catch him, Kevin accidentally triggers a machine Herb was building and grows until he is thirty stories tall, destroying the castle. He tramples through London, rescuing his friends and battling Scarlet just as the other Minions turn up in London. Scarlet tries to eradicate them, but Kevin swallows a massive missile she fires at them. Scarlet and Herb attempt to escape with her rocket-dress, but Kevin holds onto it. The missile detonates, causing it to explode. The other Minions stare at the explosion in sadness but Kevin turns out to have survived and shrunk back to his normal size.

At a conference in <a href="/wiki/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> where the Accords are to be ratified, a bomb kills King <a href="/wiki/T%27Chaka" title="T'Chaka">T'Chaka</a> of Wakanda.

Nereus points out that if Orm succeeds in uniting Atlantis he will receive the title of <a href="/wiki/Ocean_Master" title="Ocean Master">Ocean Master</a>, commander of the most powerful force on the planet. Their meeting is interrupted when another Russian <a href="/wiki/Akula-class_submarine" title="Akula-class submarine">Akula</a> submarine attacks the meeting place, apparently in retaliation for the previous submarine's sinking. Orm succeeds in destroying it and the attack convinces Nereus to join forces with Orm to defend the oceans. He swears allegiance to Orm's cause, but his daughter <a href="/wiki/Mera_(comics)" title="Mera (comics)">Mera</a>, who has been betrothed to Orm, refuses to aid them and journeys to the surface to ask Arthur for help, earning his trust by saving Thomas from a tsunami sent by Orm.

They are ambushed by Orm's men and Mera and Vulko escape without having been seen, while Arthur is captured.
</p><p>Arthur is chained and presented before Orm, who blames Arthur and the surface for Atlanna's death. He offers Arthur an opportunity to leave forever, but Arthur instead challenges him to a duel in a ring of underwater lava. Orm gains the upper hand and nearly kills Arthur before Mera rescues him.

Meanwhile, Orm meets David, revealing that the submarine that had attacked them previously was in fact the same one David hijacked and that Orm had hired him to hijack the Russian nuclear submarine so that he could stage a false flag attack from the surface, making it seem like Orm's cause for war is justified and causing King Nereus to side with him. Orm provides David with a prototype Atlantean battle suit to kill Arthur, imprisons Vulko after revealing knowledge of his betrayal, and coerces the Atlantean Kingdom of the Fishermen to pledge their allegiance to him and his campaign against the surface.
</p><p>After modifying Orm's technology, a fully armored David rechristens himself as <a href="/wiki/Black_Manta" title="Black Manta">Black Manta</a> and ambushes Arthur and Mera in Sicily, grievously injuring Arthur before being thrown off a cliff to his apparent death. Mera nurses Arthur's wounds as they journey to the trident's whereabouts, and encourages him to embrace his destiny as a hero. Arriving at their destination, Arthur and Mera are attacked by the amphibious monsters called <a href="/wiki/The_Trench_(comics)" title="The Trench (comics)">the Trench</a>, but manage to fend them off and reach a wormhole that transports them to an uncharted sea located at the center of the Earth. There, they are unexpectedly reunited with Atlanna, who was sacrificed to the Trench for her crimes but managed to escape and reach the uncharted sea, where she has been stranded ever since.
</p><p>Arthur faces Karathen, a mythical <a href="/wiki/Leviathan" title="Leviathan">leviathan</a> and keeper of the trident, and voices his determination to protect both Atlantis and the surface, proving his worth and reclaiming the trident, which grants him control over the seven seas. Orm and his allies lead an army against the crustacean forces of the Kingdom of the Brine with the intent of completing Orm's surface battle preparations. As Orm declares himself Ocean Master, Arthur and Mera, with the assistance of Karathen and the Trench, intervene and lead an army of marine creatures in a battle against him. Orm's followers renounce their obedience to him and embrace Arthur as the true king upon learning he wields the trident. Arthur defeats Orm in combat but chooses to spare his life and Orm accepts his fate after discovering Arthur has found and rescued Atlanna. Atlanna returns to the surface to reunite with Thomas while Arthur ascends to the throne with Mera by his side.

The Autobots fight off three pursuing Decepticons: the Dreads, and rush to return Sentinel to their base for protection, but Sentinel betrays them and murders the Autobot <a href="/wiki/Ironhide" title="Ironhide">Ironhide</a>, revealing he had made a deal with Megatron to ensure Cybertron's survival.
</p><p>Sentinel uses the Pillars to transport hundreds of concealed Decepticons from the Moon to Earth. Carly is later captured by Dylan, who is revealed to be in service of the Decepticons. The Autobots are exiled from Earth at the demand of the Decepticons to avoid war, but as their ship leaves Earth it is destroyed by <a href="/wiki/Starscream" title="Starscream">Starscream</a>, seemingly killing the Autobots. The Decepticons, led by Megatron and Sentinel, invade <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> as their agents place Pillars around the world. Dylan reveals to Carly that the Decepticons plan to transport their homeworld Cybertron to the Solar System, and then enslave humanity and use Earth's resources to rebuild their world. Sam teams up with former <a href="/wiki/United_States_Air_Force" title="United States Air Force">USAF</a> <a href="/wiki/Chief_master_sergeant" title="Chief master sergeant">Chief</a> Robert Epps and several ex-NEST soldiers to go into Chicago to save Carly and arrest Dylan, but they are nearly killed by Decepticon forces before the Autobots intervene, revealing they concealed themselves during the launch of their ship to convince the Decepticons they were destroyed.
</p><p>Working together, the Autobots, along with several ex-<a href="/wiki/United_States_Army_Rangers" title="United States Army Rangers">Rangers</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy_SEALs" title="United States Navy SEALs">Navy SEALs</a>, manage to rescue Carly and kill Laserbeak, the Driller, Starscream, <a href="/wiki/Soundwave_(Transformers)" title="Soundwave (Transformers)">Soundwave</a>, and Shockwave, with Optimus using Shockwave's arm-cannon to blast the Control Pillar, disabling the Space Bridge. During the battle, the Autobot Wheeljack is killed while Wheelie and Brains sneak on board a Decepticon warship and sabotage it. Sam confronts Dylan as he reactivates the Control Pillar, and knocks Dylan into the Pillar, killing him. <a href="/wiki/Bumblebee_(Transformers)" title="Bumblebee (Transformers)">Bumblebee</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ratchet_(Transformers)" title="Ratchet (Transformers)">Ratchet</a> arrive and destroy the Control Pillar, permanently disabling the Bridge and causing the partially transported Cybertron to implode, becoming badly damaged. Optimus and Sentinel fight while Carly convinces Megatron that he will be replaced by Sentinel as leader of the Decepticons. Sentinel severs Optimus's right arm and is about to execute him until Megatron, having listened to Carly, intervenes, incapacitating Sentinel. Megatron slyly proposes a truce, having the desire to become the one in charge again, but Optimus instead attacks Megatron, decapitating and killing him. Sentinel pleads for his life, but Optimus executes him too for his betrayal. With the Decepticons defeated, Carly and Sam are reunited and the Autobots, knowing that Cybertron is badly damaged, remain on Earth still; making it their temporary home.

As Bond and Patrice fight atop a moving train, <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" title="M (James Bond)">M</a> orders Moneypenny to shoot Patrice; Moneypenny inadvertently hits Bond, who falls into a river.

MI6's servers are hacked and M receives a taunting computer message moments before the MI6 building explodes. Bond, who used his presumed death to retire, learns of the attack and returns to London. Although he fails a series of physical, medical and psychological examinations, M approves his return to the field, ordering him to identify Patrice's employer, recover the stolen hard drive, and kill Patrice.

The two fight, but Patrice falls to his death before Bond can learn his employer's identity. Bond finds a <a href="/wiki/Casino_token" title="Casino token">casino token</a> that Patrice intended to cash in for the assassination, which leads him to a casino in <a href="/wiki/Macau" title="Macau">Macau</a>. There, Bond is approached by <a href="/wiki/S%C3%A9v%C3%A9rine" title="Sévérine">Sévérine</a>, Patrice's accomplice, and asks to meet her employer. She warns him that he is about to be killed by her bodyguards, but promises to help Bond if he will kill her employer. Bond thwarts the attack and joins Sévérine on her yacht, the <i>Chimera</i>.

</p><p>At MI6's new underground headquarters, Q attempts to decrypt Silva's laptop, but inadvertently gives it access to the MI6 servers, which allows Silva to escape.

When Silva's men arrive, Bond, M, and Kincade manage to kill most of them, but M is wounded. Silva himself arrives by helicopter with more men and heavy weapons, so Bond sends M and Kincade through a <a href="/wiki/Priest_hole" title="Priest hole">priest hole</a> to a nearby chapel. As the house is destroyed Bond escapes down the same tunnel and heads toward the chapel.

</p><p>Sixty-five million years ago, an alien race known as the “Creators” used devices called Seeds to terraform Planet Earth, covering it with an alloy called Transformium. In the present day, <a href="/wiki/Geologist" title="Geologist">geologist</a> Darcy Tyril excavates the Transformium for K.S.I. Industries, which uses it to build man-made Transformer drones.
</p><p>Five years after <a href="/wiki/Transformers:_Dark_of_the_Moon" title="Transformers: Dark of the Moon">the Battle of Chicago</a>, humans have begun to view the Transformers as a threat, leading the U.S. government to terminate all human-Autobot joint programs. Although the public believes the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Autobots" title="Autobots">Autobots</a> have been granted sanctuary, they are being hunted by a rogue <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CIA" title="CIA">CIA</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Black_ops" title="Black ops">black ops</a> division known as Cemetery Wind, led by opportunistic government official Harold Attinger, who believes all Transformers should be exterminated regardless of their faction. They are aided by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lockdown_(Transformers)" title="Lockdown (Transformers)">Lockdown</a>, a Cybertronian <a href="/wiki/Bounty_hunter" title="Bounty hunter">bounty hunter</a> working for the Creators, promising to give Attinger a Seed if his division manages to capture <a href="/wiki/Optimus_Prime" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a>. Cemetery Wind locates <a href="/wiki/Ratchet_(Transformers)" title="Ratchet (Transformers)">Ratchet</a> in <a href="/wiki/Mexico_City" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a> and Lockdown kills him when he refuses to give up the whereabouts of Optimus Prime.
</p><p>Optimus, damaged in Mexico City and disguised as an old Marmon 97 semi-truck, is discovered in an abandoned theater by Cade Yeager, a financially struggling Texan inventor, and brings him back to his farm. While his teenage daughter Tessa and business partner Lucas Flannery encourage him to turn Optimus over to the authorities after realizing what he really is, Cade instead fixes Optimus, hoping to understand his technology and unexpectedly revives him. Still skeptical of Optimus, Lucas calls Cemetery Wind, who attacks and destroys the farm, but Optimus and Tessa's boyfriend, Irish <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rally_car" title="Rally car">rally car</a> driver Shane Dyson, come to the family's aid. While on the run from Cemetery Wind and Lockdown, Lucas is killed by one of Lockdown's grenades. Escaping into the desert, they take refuge in an abandoned gas station. Later, Optimus gains an alternate form after scanning a passing Western Star 5700 XE Phantom Custom truck with the original red and blue paint with flames and summons the surviving Autobots – <a href="/wiki/Bumblebee_(Transformers)" title="Bumblebee (Transformers)">Bumblebee</a>, who has assumed an alternate form (a 1967 Chevrolet Camaro), <a href="/wiki/Hound_(Transformers)" title="Hound (Transformers)">Hound</a>, <a href="/wiki/Drift_(Transformers)" title="Drift (Transformers)">Drift</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crosshairs_(Transformers)" title="Crosshairs (Transformers)">Crosshairs</a> – who have come to distrust humans due to Cemetery Wind constantly hunting them down. Using a CIA drone which he stole during the home invasion, Cade discovers K.S.I.'s involvement in the attacks on the Autobots. Optimus vows to personally kill Attinger for his actions against his brethren.
</p><p>Infiltrating K.S.I.'s headquarters in <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, Cade discovers the remains of Autobots and Decepticons are being melted down to make the drones. Joshua Joyce, the ambitious company CEO, is in league with Attinger to revolutionize global defenses and improve human society using the Seed. He has captured Brains and used him and data from <a href="/wiki/Megatron" title="Megatron">Megatron</a>'s head to create the drones and prototype Transformer soldiers <a href="/wiki/Galvatron" title="Galvatron">Galvatron</a> and Stinger. In a fit of rage, the Autobots storm the building, during which Bumblebee regains his original form by scanning a passing 2014 Chevrolet Camaro, where they rescue Brains and destroy the laboratory, but they soon leave after Joshua announces that they are no longer needed. Attinger forces Joshua to deploy Galvatron and Stinger to attack the Autobots. During the battle, Galvatron's behavior becomes slightly erratic when it starts destroying vehicles, and when it fights Optimus it speaks to him. Lockdown then arrives and abducts Optimus while Galvatron and Stinger retreat; Tessa is inadvertently captured alongside Optimus in the midst of the chaos, leaving Cade and Shane devastated.
</p><p>While Lockdown's large prison spacecraft hovers over Chicago to hand over the Seed, Cade, Shane, and the Autobots use the opportunity to sneak on board and rescue Optimus and Tessa, hijacking a smaller ship containing a group of Autobots called the <a href="/wiki/Dinobots" title="Dinobots">Dinobots</a>, just before Lockdown leaves Earth. The Autobots reveal to Cade that "Galvatron" is in fact Megatron, who gave K.S.I. the data to build the Transformer drones so he could transfer his consciousness into the Galvatron drone, after they had unknowingly revived him. What's more, Galvatron is plotting to use the Seed and the K.S.I. drones to conquer the world by detonating the Seed in <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, as K.S.I. has brought it there to use it in the remote Mongolian desert to create vast amounts of usable Transformium. Cade informs Joshua of Megatron's presence, causing him to have a change of heart and agreeing to hand over the Seed with help from Darcy and his Chinese business associate Su Yueming. Meanwhile, Lockdown discovers Optimus' escape with the Dinobots, and returns to Earth to retrieve them. Optimus decides for the Autobots to no longer help the humans because of how they revived Megatron, but Cade explains to Optimus why he shouldn't lose faith in them. At the K.S.I. facility, during a disagreement between Joshua and Attinger over the Seed, Galvatron reactivates himself and promptly takes control of the K.S.I. drones, and a battle follows in Hong Kong's streets between Cade's group, the Autobots, Cemetery Wind, Galvatron, and his drones. During the fight, Optimus gains the alliance of the Dinobots, who become essential to the Autobots' victory while Bumblebee kills Stinger.
</p><p>Lockdown returns to capture Optimus and the Dinobots, using a large <a href="/wiki/Magnet" title="Magnet">magnet</a> in his ship that picks up and drops metal objects, causing destruction to the city. After disabling the magnet, Optimus fights Lockdown at an abandoned factory. In the ensuing duel, Optimus kills Attinger (who still angrily deems all Cybertronians aside from Lockdown as a threat) to save Cade, and avenging the deaths of his fellow Autobots, but this allows Lockdown to pin Optimus down by impaling his chest with his own sword. Cade, Bumblebee, Tessa, and Shane fight Lockdown, with Cade ending up fighting him one-on-one while Tessa and Shane use a tow truck to free Optimus, who kills Lockdown by cutting him in half before using one of his grenades to finish off the remaining drones. Galvatron retreats, vowing to return.
</p><p>As Lockdown's ship leaves Earth, Optimus tells the Autobots to protect the Yeagers (with Joshua offering to help the Yeagers build a new home) and lets the Dinobots go, before flying away into space with the Seed to hide it away, sending a message to the Creators that <a href="/wiki/Transformers:_The_Last_Knight" title="Transformers: The Last Knight">he is coming for them</a>.

Talos, arriving unarmed, explains that the Skrulls are refugees searching for a new home and that Lawson was Mar-Vell, a renegade Kree scientist helping them. Talos plays a recovered recording from Lawson's jet, prompting Danvers to remember the crash: Lawson was killed by Yon-Rogg to prevent her from destroying the engine before the Kree could recover it. Destroying the engine herself, Danvers absorbed the energy from the ensuing explosion, gaining powers but losing her memory.
</p><p>Danvers, Talos, Fury, and Rambeau locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson hid several Skrulls, including Talos's family, and the <a href="/wiki/Cosmic_Cube" title="Cosmic Cube">Tesseract</a>, the power source of Lawson’s engine. There, Danvers is captured by Starforce and interfaces with the Supreme Intelligence. During their conversation, Danvers removes the Kree implant that was suppressing her powers, allowing her to reach her full potential. In the subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an alien <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flerken" title="Flerken">Flerken</a>.

</p><p>Six months following Pavel's kidnapping, Bane sets up his base in the city sewers, and prompts Wayne's corporate rival John Daggett to buy Wayne's fingerprints. Cat burglar <a href="/wiki/Catwoman" title="Catwoman">Selina Kyle</a> obtains Wayne's prints from <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Manor" title="Wayne Manor">Wayne Manor</a> for Daggett, but she is double-crossed at the exchange, and alerts the police. Gordon and the police arrive and pursue Bane and Daggett's henchmen into the sewers while Selina flees. The men capture Gordon and take him to Bane. Gordon escapes and is found by rookie officer <a href="/wiki/Robin_in_other_media#The_Dark_Knight_Rises" title="Robin in other media">John Blake</a>. Blake, a fellow orphan, confronts Bruce and convinces him to return as Batman. Bane later attacks the Gotham Stock Exchange by using Wayne's fingerprints in a series of transactions that leaves Wayne bankrupt; Batman resurfaces for the first time in eight years while intercepting Bane and his subordinates. Wayne's butler, <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred Pennyworth</a> resigns in an attempt to save Bruce from death at the hands of Bane. Wayne finds comfort in new Wayne Enterprises CEO Miranda Tate. Using the stolen transactions, Bane expands his operations and kills Daggett.
</p><p>Kyle agrees to take Batman to Bane but instead leads him into Bane's trap. Bane reveals that he intends to fulfill <a href="/wiki/Ra%27s_al_Ghul" title="Ra's al Ghul">Ra's al Ghul's</a> mission to destroy Gotham. Bane fights Batman and defeats him; dealing a crippling blow to his back before taking him abroad to an underground prison. There, the inmates tell Wayne the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, who was born and raised in the prison before finally escaping — the only prisoner to have done so. Bane lures Gotham's police into the underground sewer network and uses explosives to trap them, and destroy the bridges surrounding the city. He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia and forces Dr. Pavel to convert the reactor core into a decaying <a href="/wiki/Neutron_bomb" title="Neutron bomb">neutron bomb</a> at a football stadium before killing him as well. Bane reads Gordon's speech to the public, and releases the prisoners of <a href="/wiki/Blackgate_Penitentiary" title="Blackgate Penitentiary">Blackgate Penitentiary</a>, initiating chaos while holding the city hostage and isolated with the bomb.
</p><p>Months later, a recovered Wayne escapes from the prison and returns to Gotham. Batman frees the trapped police and they clash with Bane's army in the streets; during the battle, Batman overpowers Bane. Tate intervenes and stabs Batman, revealing herself to be <a href="/wiki/Talia_al_Ghul" title="Talia al Ghul">Talia al Ghul</a>, Ra's al Ghul's daughter. She activates the bomb's detonator, but Gordon blocks her signal. Talia leaves to find the bomb while Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Kyle arrives and kills Bane. Batman and Kyle pursue Talia, hoping to bring the bomb back to the reactor chamber where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she remotely floods and destroys the reactor chamber before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman uses the <a href="/wiki/Batplane" title="Batplane">Batplane</a> to haul the bomb far over the bay, where it safely explodes. Before takeoff, Batman reveals his identity to Gordon.
</p><p>In the aftermath, Batman is presumed dead and is honored as a hero. With Wayne presumed dead as well, Wayne Manor becomes an orphanage and his remaining estate is left to Alfred. Gordon finds the previously destroyed Bat Signal repaired, while Lucius Fox discovers that Wayne had fixed the previously malfunctioning auto-pilot on the Batplane. Blake resigns from the police force and a parcel left to him in Wayne's will leads him to find the <a href="/wiki/Batcave" title="Batcave">Batcave</a>. While visiting <a href="/wiki/Florence" title="Florence">Florence</a>, Alfred discovers that Wayne is alive, and in a relationship with Kyle.
</p><p>17-year-old Andy is preparing to go to college. He has not played with his toys in years, and most of them are gone, except for <a href="/wiki/Sheriff_Woody" title="Sheriff Woody">Woody</a>, <a href="/wiki/Buzz_Lightyear" title="Buzz Lightyear">Buzz Lightyear</a>, <a href="/wiki/Jessie_(Toy_Story)" title="Jessie (Toy Story)">Jessie</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bullseye_(Toy_Story)" title="Bullseye (Toy Story)">Bullseye</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rex_(Toy_Story)" title="Rex (Toy Story)">Rex</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Slinky_Dog" title="Slinky Dog">Slinky</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hamm_(Toy_Story)" title="Hamm (Toy Story)">Hamm</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mr._Potato_Head_(Toy_Story)" title="Mr. Potato Head (Toy Story)">Mr.</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mrs._Potato_Head_(Toy_Story)" title="Mrs. Potato Head (Toy Story)">Mrs. Potato Head</a>, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Squeeze_Toy_Aliens" title="Squeeze Toy Aliens">Aliens</a>, and three <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sarge_and_the_Bucket_O_Soldiers" title="Sarge and the Bucket O Soldiers">army men</a>.  The despondent toys reflect on their future, and the army men leave by parachuting out the window. Andy intends to take Woody with him to college and puts the other toys in a trash bag to put them in the attic; however, Andy's mother thinks the bag is trash and mistakenly throws it out. The toys escape and climb into her car, as they are upset and believe Andy tossed them away, and get into a donation box with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Molly_(Toy_Story)" title="Molly (Toy Story)">Molly</a>'s old <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Barbie_(Toy_Story)" title="Barbie (Toy Story)">Barbie</a> doll, bound for Sunnyside Daycare.  Woody follows but is unable to convince them that Andy meant to keep them, and is forced to go along when Andy's mother drives off to donate them.
</p><p>Andy's toys are welcomed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lots-O%27-Huggin%27_Bear" title="Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear">Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear</a> ("Lotso") and the other toys at Sunnyside. Except Woody, Andy's toys are delighted to learn that Sunnyside never runs out of children to play with, and Barbie is enamored of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ken_(Toy_Story)" title="Ken (Toy Story)">Ken</a> doll there. Woody attempts to return home, but is instead found by Sunnyside student Bonnie, who brings him home and plays with him and her other toys, which are well-treated. Bonnie's clown toy <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chuckles_(Toy_Story)" title="Chuckles (Toy Story)">Chuckles</a> explains that he, Lotso, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Big_Baby_(Toy_Story)" title="Big Baby (Toy Story)">Big Baby</a> once had a beloved owner named Daisy, but were lost during a family trip. When they made it home, Lotso found he had been replaced. His personality changed; he lied to Big Baby, saying Daisy had replaced all of them. When they found Sunnyside, Lotso took over it, turning it into a toy prison, and Chuckles only escaped because Bonnie took him home for repair.
</p><p>At Sunnyside, Andy's toys dislike the toddlers' rough play. Buzz asks Lotso to move the toys to the older children's room, but Lotso switches Buzz to his original factory setting, erasing his memory. Mrs. Potato Head, through an eye she lost in Andy's room, sees Andy searching for them. They realize Woody was telling the truth about Andy's intentions and try to leave. Andy's toys are imprisoned by Lotso's henchmen who rely on "new recruits" to save themselves from the preschoolers' abuse.
</p><p>Woody returns to Sunnyside and learns from a <a href="/wiki/Chatter_Telephone" title="Chatter Telephone">Chatter Telephone</a> that the only way out is through the trash. Andy's toys accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Spanish Buzz promptly allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso's gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals Lotso's deception to Big Baby, who throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso's henchmen retreat and Lotso drags Woody into the dumpster as the truck collects the trash. The rest of the toys fall into the truck while trying to rescue him, except Barbie, Ken and Big Baby. A falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and personality. The truck brings the toys to a landfill, where the Aliens are swept away after spotting an industrial claw and the other toys are deposited on a conveyor belt that leads to an <a href="/wiki/Incineration" title="Incineration">incinerator</a>. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate and prepare to die, but are rescued by the Aliens operating the claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who ties him to his truck's radiator <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grille_(motor_vehicle)" title="Grille (motor vehicle)">grille</a> and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.
</p><p>Woody leaves a note for Andy, who, thinking the note is from his mother, donates the toys to Bonnie. Andy introduces the toys individually to Bonnie, and to Andy's surprise, Woody is at the bottom of the donation box and Bonnie recognizes him. Though initially hesitant, Andy passes Woody on to Bonnie, and they play together before he leaves. Woody and the other toys witness Andy's departure as they begin their new lives with Bonnie.
</p><p>In the film’s epilogue, Barbie, Ken, and Big Baby have made vast improvements to Sunnyside and maintain contact with Bonnie's toys through letters. After parachuting in, the army men are welcomed to Sunnyside.
</p><p>The wedding of <a href="/wiki/Will_Turner" title="Will Turner">Will Turner</a> and <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Swann" title="Elizabeth Swann">Elizabeth Swann</a> is halted when Lord <a href="/wiki/Cutler_Beckett" title="Cutler Beckett">Cutler Beckett</a>, chairman of the <a href="/wiki/East_India_Company" title="East India Company">East India Trading Company</a>, arrives with <a href="/wiki/Arrest_warrant" title="Arrest warrant">arrest warrants</a> for them, and also for Commodore <a href="/wiki/James_Norrington" title="James Norrington">James Norrington</a>, who allowed Captain <a href="/wiki/Jack_Sparrow" title="Jack Sparrow">Jack Sparrow</a> to escape. Norrington has resigned and disappeared after losing the Navy's <a href="/wiki/Flagship" title="Flagship">flagship</a>, HMS <i>Dauntless</i>, in a hurricane while pursuing Jack. Meanwhile, Jack is visited by Will's father, <a href="/wiki/Bootstrap_Bill_Turner" title="Bootstrap Bill Turner">Bootstrap Bill Turner</a>, aboard the <i><a href="/wiki/Black_Pearl" title="Black Pearl">Black Pearl</a></i>. Bootstrap is now a crewman on the <i><a href="/wiki/Flying_Dutchman_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" title="Flying Dutchman (Pirates of the Caribbean)">Flying Dutchman</a></i>, captained by <a href="/wiki/Davy_Jones_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" title="Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)">Davy Jones</a>.

Beckett, meanwhile, promises to free Elizabeth if Will brings him Jack's magic compass which points to whatever the holder wants most.
</p><p>Will finds Jack and the crew on an island and frees them from <a href="/wiki/Cannibalism" title="Cannibalism">cannibals</a>. Shortly after, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_characters#Governor_Swann" title="List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters">Governor Swann</a> frees Elizabeth from jail, but he is then captured. Elizabeth bargains with Beckett to find the compass. Disguised as a cabin boy aboard a Scottish merchant vessel, she makes her way to Tortuga where she later finds Jack and also a drunken Norrington. After escaping the cannibals, Jack and the crew visit <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/voodoo" title="wikt:voodoo">voodoo</a> priestess <a href="/wiki/Tia_Dalma" title="Tia Dalma">Tia Dalma</a>, who reveals Jones' weakness is his heart, which is locked within the Dead Man's Chest. Jack must find it and the key that opens it. Locating the <i>Dutchman</i>, Will makes a deal with Jack to find the key to the chest in return for Jack's compass. Jack tricks Will, who is <a href="/wiki/Shanghaiing" title="Shanghaiing">shanghaied</a> into service aboard the <i>Dutchman</i>. Jones agrees to release Jack from their bargain in exchange for one hundred souls. Will meets his father aboard the <i>Dutchman</i> and learns that Jones possesses the key to the chest. They play a game of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Liar%27s_Dice" title="Liar's Dice">Liar's Dice</a> against Jones to try and win the key, but they lose. Despite this, Will escapes with the key and is taken aboard the same ship Elizabeth was on. Jones sends the Kraken after him, sinking the ship, but Will escapes.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/List_of_locations_in_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean#Tortuga" title="List of locations in Pirates of the Caribbean">Tortuga</a>, Jack hires a new crew, including Elizabeth and Norrington. With Elizabeth's use of Jack's compass, they are able to locate the chest. All parties arrive on <a href="/wiki/List_of_locations_in_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean#Isla_Cruces" title="List of locations in Pirates of the Caribbean">Isla Cruces</a>, where the chest is buried, but a three-way sword fight breaks out between Jack, Will, and Norrington, who all want the heart for their respective goals: Jack wants to call off the Kraken; Will wants to rescue his father; and Norrington wants to regain his life as a Navy officer. In the chaos, Norrington secretly steals the heart and runs off, pretending to lure away the <i>Dutchman</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s crew. Jones attacks the <i>Pearl</i> with the Kraken, which kills most of the crew and destroys all but one of the <i>Pearl</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s lifeboats, but Jack, who briefly flees the battle, returns and wounds the Kraken with a net full of gunpowder and rum.
</p><p>Jack orders the survivors to abandon ship, but Elizabeth, realizing the Kraken only wants Jack, tricks him and chains him to the mast so that the crew can escape. The Kraken drags Jack and the <i>Pearl</i> to Davy Jones' Locker. Jones opens the chest to discover his heart is gone. In Port Royal, Norrington gives Beckett the heart and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Letters_of_Marque" title="Letters of Marque">Letters of Marque</a> meant for Jack, allowing him back into the navy as well as allowing Beckett to gain control of Davy Jones and the seas. The <i>Pearl</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s crew take shelter with Tia Dalma, where they all agree to rescue Jack.

Cassian is covertly ordered to kill Galen rather than extract him.

With the aid of blind spiritual warrior <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chirrut_%C3%8Emwe" title="Chirrut Îmwe">Chirrut Îmwe</a> and his mercenary friend <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Baze_Malbus" title="Baze Malbus">Baze Malbus</a>, Jyn makes contact with Gerrera, who has been holding Rook captive.

</p><p>On the Death Star, Krennic orders a low-powered test shot which destroys Jedha's capital. Jyn and her group take Rook and flee the moon, but Gerrera remains to die with the city. <a href="/wiki/Grand_Moff_Tarkin" title="Grand Moff Tarkin">Grand Moff Tarkin</a> congratulates Krennic before using Rook's defection and security leak as a pretext to take control of the project. Rook leads the group to Galen's Imperial research facility on the planet <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eadu" title="Eadu">Eadu</a>, where Cassian chooses not to kill Galen. Jyn makes her presence known moments before Rebel bombers attack the facility. Galen is wounded and dies in his daughter's arms, before she escapes with her group on board a stolen Imperial cargo shuttle. Krennic is summoned by <a href="/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a> to answer for the attack on Eadu. Krennic seeks his support for an audience with the <a href="/wiki/Palpatine" title="Palpatine">Emperor</a>, but Vader instead orders him to ensure no further breaches occur.
</p><p>Jyn proposes a plan to steal the Death Star schematics using the Rebel fleet but fails to gain approval from the Alliance Council, who feel victory against the Empire is now impossible. Frustrated at their inaction, Jyn's group lead a small squad of Rebel volunteers to raid the databank themselves. Arriving at Scarif on the stolen Imperial ship, which Rook dubs "Rogue One", a disguised Jyn and Cassian enter the base with K-2SO while the other Rebels attack the resident <a href="/wiki/Stormtrooper_(Star_Wars)" title="Stormtrooper (Star Wars)">Imperial garrison</a> as a diversion. The Rebel fleet learns of the raid from intercepted Imperial communications and deploy in support. K-2SO sacrifices himself so Jyn and Cassian can retrieve the data. Îmwe is killed after activating the master switch to allow communication with the Rebel fleet, and Malbus dies in battle shortly afterwards. Rook is killed by a grenade after informing the Rebel fleet that it must deactivate the shield surrounding the planet to allow the transmission of the schematics. Jyn and Cassian obtain the schematics, but they are ambushed by Krennic, who is eventually shot and wounded by Cassian. Jyn transmits the schematics to the Rebel command ship. The Death Star enters orbit above Scarif, where Tarkin uses another low-power shot to destroy the compromised base, killing Krennic, Cassian, and Jyn.
</p><p>The Rebel fleet prepares to jump to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hyperspace_(science_fiction)" title="Hyperspace (science fiction)">hyperspace</a>, but many of the fleet's ships are intercepted by Vader's flagship.

</p><p>Jack refuses the offer and escapes. He meets up with his father, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Captain_Teague" title="Captain Teague">Captain Teague</a>, who warns Jack about the Fountain's rituals. Jack learns someone is impersonating him to recruit a crew to find the Fountain. The impostor is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Angelica_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" title="Angelica (Pirates of the Caribbean)">Angelica</a>, Jack's former lover, and the daughter of the ruthless pirate <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Blackbeard_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" title="Blackbeard (Pirates of the Caribbean)">Blackbeard</a>, who practices <a href="/wiki/Haitian_Vodou" title="Haitian Vodou">voodoo</a> magic and wields the mythical "Sword of <a href="/wiki/Triton_(mythology)" title="Triton (mythology)">Triton</a>" that controls his ship, the <i><a href="/wiki/Queen_Anne%27s_Revenge" title="Queen Anne's Revenge">Queen Anne's Revenge</a></i>. While Jack is <a href="/wiki/Shanghaiing" title="Shanghaiing">shanghaied</a> aboard Blackbeard's ship, Gibbs escapes execution by memorizing and destroying Jack's map showing the Fountain's location, forcing Barbossa to take him along.
</p><p>Meanwhile, after a failed <a href="/wiki/Mutiny" title="Mutiny">mutiny</a> aboard the <i>Queen Anne's Revenge</i>, Jack is forced to guide the crew to the Fountain. Blackbeard seeks the Fountain's power to circumvent his predestined fatal encounter with a "one-legged man", who happened to be Barbossa. Jack must find two silver chalices aboard <a href="/wiki/Juan_Ponce_de_Le%C3%B3n" title="Juan Ponce de León">Juan Ponce de León</a>'s missing <a href="/wiki/Flagship" title="Flagship">flagship</a>, the <i>Santiago</i>. The Fountain's water must simultaneously be drunk by two people from the chalices. Drinking from one chalice containing a <a href="/wiki/Mermaid" title="Mermaid">mermaid</a>'s tear will extend life; the second person dies, their remaining years of life transferred to the other drinker. Jack also discovers that the <i>Black Pearl</i> was captured and shrunk before being added to Blackbeard's collection of other shrunken <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ship_in_a_bottle" title="Ship in a bottle">ships in bottles</a>.
</p><p>The <i>Queen Anne's Revenge</i> heads for Whitecap Bay to find and harvest mermaid tears. After managing to lure in a mermaid named Tamara, she summons other mermaids to attack the crew before Jack causes an explosion that scares them away. A mermaid named Syrena is caught, but Philip Swift, a captive missionary, falls in love with her. Reaching Ponce de León's ship on an uncharted island, Angelica and Blackbeard coerce Jack into retrieving both chalices. Jack locates the grounded, decaying vessel, only to find Barbossa there. Both guess that the Spanish have taken the chalices, after they are nowhere to be found on the vessel.
</p><p>Jack and Barbossa team up to sneak into the Spanish camp and steal the chalices. Barbossa reveals he only wants revenge against Blackbeard for attacking the <i>Black Pearl</i>, and his leg being amputated. Jack and Barbossa escape with the chalices. Meanwhile, Syrena, reciprocating Philip's love, is tricked into shedding a tear. Blackbeard collects it, leaving her to die of dehydration while Philip is forced to go with them. Jack returns with the chalices and bargains with Blackbeard for Angelica's safety, Jack's confiscated magical compass (which they took from him before sending him to get the chalices), and Gibbs' release. In return, Jack vows to give Blackbeard the chalices and lead him to the Fountain; Blackbeard agrees, and Gibbs is set free with the compass.
</p><p>At the Fountain, Blackbeard's crew is confronted by Barbossa and his men and they battle while Barbossa and Blackbeard fight. The Spanish suddenly arrive, intending to destroy the Fountain, believing its power an abomination against God. They crush the chalices and throw them in the swamp. When Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with a poisoned sword, Angelica pulls it out but is cut and poisoned. Jack notices Angelica is poisoned and begins frantically searching the swamp for the chalices. Barbossa obtains Blackbeard's magic sword and gains control of the <i>Queen Anne's Revenge</i> and her crew. Despite resistance from Blackbeard's crew, the Spanish successfully pull down a pillar, crushing the Fountain of Youth. The Spanish army leaves once the fountain is in ruins. Philip is mortally wounded, but he returns to free Syrena. She helps Jack retrieve the missing chalices and gives them to him, telling him not to waste her tear. Syrena goes back to the dying Philip. She says she can save him if he asks her to. When he asks for her forgiveness, she kisses him and takes him underwater.
</p><p>With Blackbeard and Angelica both nearing death, Jack retrieves the last remaining drops of water from the destroyed fountain and puts the tear in one of them. Knowing that one of them must be sacrificed, he wants Angelica to drink from the chalice containing the tear. Instead, Blackbeard drinks it, asking his daughter to save him. Angelica agrees and drinks from the second chalice. Jack is upset to lose Angelica, but reveals that he made a mistake about which chalice contained the tear. Neither of the two are happy, and they both believe Jack deliberately tricked them. Angelica's wounds are healed as the Fountain fatally consumes Blackbeard's body, killing him.
</p><p>Eventually, Jack and Angelica admit their love for each other, yet he distrusts her intentions (aware that she may try to avenge her father) and strands her on a <a href="/wiki/Cay" title="Cay">cay</a>. Now wielding Blackbeard's magical sword, Barbossa captains the <i>Queen Anne's Revenge</i> and returns to piracy. Jack finds Gibbs, who had used the compass to locate the <i>Revenge</i>. He reclaims the shrunken <i>Black Pearl</i> and the other conquered ships in bottles, carrying them in a <a href="/wiki/Gunny_sack" title="Gunny sack">gunny sack</a>. The two leave, <a href="/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_Dead_Men_Tell_No_Tales" title="Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales">hoping to revert the <i>Black Pearl</i> to its original size and continue living the pirates' life</a>.

He and his partner (and wife) Lucy are sent to foil the plans of Balthazar Bratt, a former <a href="/wiki/Child_actor" title="Child actor">child actor</a> from the 1980s who has turned evil. Gru manages to stop Bratt from stealing the Dumont Diamond, a giant pink diamond, but is unable to capture him. As a result of constantly failing to capture Bratt, Gru and Lucy are dismissed from the AVL by its unreasonable new director Valerie Da Vinci, following the retirement of the AVL's former director, Silas Ramsbottom.
</p><p>When Gru and Lucy return home, Gru and Lucy reluctantly tell their kids, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, of their dismissal, but assure them they will find new jobs. Most of Gru's <a href="/wiki/Minions_(Despicable_Me)" title="Minions (Despicable Me)">Minions</a> leave him when he refuses to return to villainy despite losing his job and having Dr. Nefario frozen in carbonite, with Dave and Jerry staying due to not knowing. Meanwhile, Lucy struggles to adapt to her new role as the children's new mom. The next morning, when a butler named Fritz arrives at the Gru house, Gru discovers that he has a twin brother named Dru, who lives in a distant country named Freedonia, who longs to meet him. Shocked to learn he has a twin, Gru confronts his mother, who reveals that when she and her husband divorced, they agreed to keep one child each. The family decides to travel to meet Dru, and they are surprised at his immense wealth, the size of the mansion, which Fritz attributes to their pig farm business. Meanwhile, the Minions are arrested for trespassing at a talent show set. Bratt manages to steal the diamond again, intending to use it to power a giant robot and destroy Hollywood as revenge for the cancellation of his show.
</p><p>Dru reveals to Gru that their recently deceased father was a legendary supervillain, whose villainous activities are the real source of the family's wealth. As Dru was dismissed by their father as a disgrace, he asks his brother to teach him how to be a villain. When Gru refuses to revert to his old ways, Dru takes him on a joyride around Freedonia in their father's technologically advanced car and the siblings bond. Meanwhile, Lucy tries to balance her new tasks as a mom, which she exhibits after turning away a young boy named Niko who had fallen for Margo in the midst of a traditional cheese festival, while Edith and Agnes stumble into a local tavern and learn from the bartender about a mythical <a href="/wiki/Unicorn" title="Unicorn">unicorn</a> which lurks in a nearby forest. Gru tries to convince Agnes that unicorns are imaginary, but decides against it to avoid hurting her feelings. The next day, Agnes and Edith set out into the woods to track the mythical 'unicorn', only to find a one-horned <a href="/wiki/Goat" title="Goat">goat</a> whom Agnes adopts and dubs "Lucky". Meanwhile, the Minions' longing for Gru motivates them to escape from prison and return to their former master.
</p><p>Dru convinces Gru to steal the diamond, with Gru secretly intending to bring it to the AVL, which he hopes will convince Da Vinci to rehire him and Lucy. Despite several setbacks, they manage to retrieve the diamond and are rescued by Lucy after narrowly escaping. After finding out Gru's true motives, Dru confronts his brother about his lie. In return, Gru insults him and decides to leave Freedonia, ending their relationship. Bratt, disguised as Lucy, kidnaps the children, and once again acquires the diamond. Gru and Dru resolve their differences and pursue him after finding the real Lucy.
</p><p>With his robot powered by the diamond, Bratt terrorizes Hollywood, intending to send it into space with the use of superpowered gum. Lucy saves the children while Gru and Dru weaken Bratt's robot with the weapons of their father's car. Gru is knocked unconscious when the car is destroyed, and Dru manages to destroy the robot's core from the inside when Bratt threatens to kill Gru. When Gru recovers, he battles Bratt in a dance fight, using it as a distraction to grab his weaponized <a href="/wiki/Keytar" title="Keytar">keytar</a>, and defeats him. Having rendezvoused with Gru, the Minions manage to destroy the gum already covering the city, and Gru and Dru reunite.
</p><p>Soon afterward, Gru and Lucy are reinstated in the AVL and the newly united family celebrate in Gru's home. Lucy is acknowledged by the children as their mother. Lured back to villainy, Dru, along with most of the Minions, steals Gru's airship, with Gru's emblem replaced with a "D" graffiti. Gru and Lucy decide to give them a five-minute head-start before engaging pursuit.
</p><p>Industrialist John Hammond and his <a href="/wiki/Biological_engineering" title="Biological engineering">bioengineering</a> company, InGen, have created a <a href="/wiki/Animal_theme_park" title="Animal theme park">theme park</a> featuring cloned dinosaurs and prehistoric plants, called Jurassic Park, on <a href="/wiki/Isla_Nublar" title="Isla Nublar">Isla Nublar</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rican</a> island. After a dinosaur handler is killed by a <i><a href="/wiki/Velociraptor" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a></i>, the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro, demand that experts visit the park and certify it is safe. To perform the inspection, Gennaro invites <a href="/wiki/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chaos_theory" title="Chaos theory">chaos theorist</a> Ian Malcolm, while Hammond invites <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paleontologist" title="Paleontologist">paleontologist</a> Dr. Alan Grant and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paleobotanist" title="Paleobotanist">paleobotanist</a> Dr. Ellie Sattler. Upon arrival, the group is shocked to see a live <i><a href="/wiki/Brachiosaurus" title="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a></i>, in addition to two more with a herd of <i><a href="/wiki/Parasaurolophus" title="Parasaurolophus">Parasaurolophus</a></i>.
</p><p>At the park's visitor center, the group learns the cloning was accomplished by extracting <a href="/wiki/Ancient_DNA" title="Ancient DNA">dinosaur DNA</a> from <a href="/wiki/Mosquito" title="Mosquito">mosquitoes</a> preserved in <a href="/wiki/Amber" title="Amber">amber</a>. DNA from <a href="/wiki/Frog" title="Frog">frogs</a> was used to fill in gaps in the dinosaurs' <a href="/wiki/Genome" title="Genome">genome</a>. To prevent breeding, all the dinosaurs were made female. Malcolm scoffs at the idea, saying it will inevitably break down. The group witnesses the hatching of a baby <i><a href="/wiki/Velociraptor" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a></i> and visits the raptor enclosure. At lunch, the group debates the <a href="/wiki/Ethics_of_cloning" title="Ethics of cloning">ethics of cloning</a> and the creation of the park. Malcolm gives a harsh warning about the implications of <a href="/wiki/Genetic_engineering" title="Genetic engineering">genetic engineering</a>.
</p><p>The group is joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Tim and Lex, for a tour of the park, while Hammond oversees the tour from the park's control room. The tour does not go as planned. Most of the dinosaurs fail to appear and the group encounters a sick <i><a href="/wiki/Triceratops" title="Triceratops">Triceratops</a></i>. It is cut short as a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" title="Tropical cyclone">tropical storm</a> approaches Isla Nublar. Most park employees leave for the mainland on a boat, while the visitors return to their electric tour vehicles. Sattler stays behind with the park's veterinarian to study the <i>Triceratops</i>.
</p><p>Jurassic Park's lead computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, has been bribed by Dodgson, a man working for Hammond's corporate rival, to steal fertilized dinosaur <a href="/wiki/Embryo" title="Embryo">embryos</a>. Nedry deactivates the park's security system to gain access to the embryo storage room and puts the stolen embryos inside a canister disguised as a <a href="/wiki/Barbasol" title="Barbasol">Barbasol</a> shaving-cream can. The power goes out, stalling the tour vehicles. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated, allowing the <i><a href="/wiki/Tyrannosaurus" title="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></i> to escape and attack the group. Grant and Hammond's grandchildren survive. The <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro. While taking the embryos to the island's dock, Nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes his <a href="/wiki/Jeep_Wrangler" title="Jeep Wrangler">Jeep Wrangler</a>, and is killed by a <i><a href="/wiki/Dilophosaurus" title="Dilophosaurus">Dilophosaurus</a></i>.
</p><p>Sattler helps the park's game warden, Robert Muldoon, search for survivors. They find only Malcolm before the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> returns. Grant, Tim, and Lex take shelter in a treetop. They later discover broken dinosaur egg shells. Grant concludes the dinosaurs have been breeding. This occurred because their West African frog DNA—<a href="/wiki/Common_reed_frog" title="Common reed frog">Common reed frog</a> can change their sex in a single-sex environment, allowing the dinosaurs to do so as well, proving Malcolm right.
</p><p>Unable to decipher Nedry's code to reactivate the security system, Hammond and the park's chief engineer Ray Arnold reboot the park's system. The group shuts down the park's grid and retreats to an emergency bunker, while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When Arnold fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head to the shed. They discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining fences and released the <i>Velociraptors</i>. Muldoon distracts the raptors, while Sattler goes to turn the power back on. As she is turning the power on, Grant, Lex and Tim are climbing the perimeter fence. Grant and Lex make it down in time but Tim is electrocuted. Grant gives Tim <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CPR" title="CPR">CPR</a> and he survives. Sattler is attacked by a raptor and discovers Arnold's severed arm. Muldoon is caught off guard and killed by the other two raptors.
</p><p>After encountering a <i><a href="/wiki/Brachiosaurus" title="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a></i> and narrowly escaping the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> during a <i><a href="/wiki/Gallimimus" title="Gallimimus">Gallimimus</a></i> stampede, Grant, Tim, and Lex reach the visitor center. Grant heads out to look for Sattler, leaving Tim and Lex inside. They are pursued by the raptors in an industrial kitchen but escape and join Grant and Sattler. Lex restores full power from the control room, allowing them to call Hammond, who in turn calls for help. Grant, Tim, Lex, and Sattler are cornered by the raptors, but they escape when the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> suddenly appears and kills the raptors. Hammond arrives in a jeep with Malcolm, and the survivors board a helicopter to leave the island.
</p><p>Dory, a <a href="/wiki/Paracanthurus" title="Paracanthurus">regal blue tang</a>, gets separated from her parents as a child. As she grows up, Dory attempts to search for them, but gradually forgets them due to her short-term memory loss. In a flashback (from <i><a href="/wiki/Finding_Nemo" title="Finding Nemo">Finding Nemo</a></i>), she joins Marlin – a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Clownfish" title="Clownfish">clownfish</a> looking for his missing son Nemo – after accidentally swimming into him.
</p><p>One year after meeting Marlin and Nemo, Dory is living with them on their reef. One day, Dory has a <a href="/wiki/Flashback_(psychology)" title="Flashback (psychology)">flashback</a> and remembers her parents. She decides to look for them, but her memory problem is an obstacle. She suddenly remembers that they lived at the "Jewel of <a href="/wiki/Morro_Bay,_California" title="Morro Bay, California">Morro Bay, California</a>" across the ocean when Nemo mentions the name.
</p><p>Marlin and Nemo accompany Dory on her journey. With the help of Crush, their sea turtle friend, they ride the <a href="/wiki/California_Current" title="California Current">California Current</a> to California. Upon arrival, they explore a shipwreck full of lost cargo, where Dory accidentally awakens a giant <a href="/wiki/Humboldt_squid" title="Humboldt squid">Humboldt squid</a>, who pursues them and almost devours Nemo. They manage to trap the squid in a large shipping container, and Marlin berates Dory for endangering them. Her feelings hurt, Dory travels to the surface to seek help where she is captured by staff members from the trio's nearby destination, the Marine Life Institute.
</p><p>Dory is placed in quarantine and tagged. There she meets a grouchy but well-meaning <a href="/wiki/Octopus" title="Octopus">octopus</a> named Hank. Dory's tag marks her for transfer to an aquarium in <a href="/wiki/Cleveland" title="Cleveland">Cleveland</a>. Hank, who fears being released back into the ocean, agrees to help Dory find her parents in exchange for her tag. In one exhibit, Dory encounters her childhood friend Destiny, a nearsighted <a href="/wiki/Whale_shark" title="Whale shark">whale shark</a>, who used to communicate with Dory through pipes, and Bailey, a <a href="/wiki/Beluga_whale" title="Beluga whale">beluga whale</a>, who mistakenly believes he has lost his ability to <a href="/wiki/Animal_echolocation" title="Animal echolocation">echolocate</a>. Dory subsequently has flashbacks of life with her parents, and struggles to recall details. She finally remembers how she was separated from her parents: she overheard her mother crying one night, left to retrieve a shell to cheer her up, and was pulled away by an <a href="/wiki/Undertow_(water_waves)" title="Undertow (water waves)">undertow current</a>.
</p><p>Marlin and Nemo attempt to rescue Dory. With the help of two lazy <a href="/wiki/California_sea_lion" title="California sea lion">California sea lions</a> named Fluke and Rudder and a <a href="/wiki/Common_loon" title="Common loon">common loon</a> named Becky, they manage to get into the institute and find her in the pipe system. Other blue tangs tell them that Dory's parents escaped from the institute a long time ago to search for her and never came back, leaving Dory believing that they have died. Hank retrieves Dory from the tank, accidentally leaving Marlin and Nemo behind. He is then apprehended by one of the employees and unintentionally drops Dory into the drain, flushing her out to the ocean. While wandering aimlessly, she comes across a trail of shells; remembering that when she was young, her parents had set out a similar trail to help her find her way back home, she follows it. At the end of the trail, Dory finds an empty <a href="/wiki/Brain_coral" title="Brain coral">brain coral</a> with multiple shell trails leading to it. As she turns to leave, she sees her parents Jenny and Charlie in the distance. They tell her they spent years laying down the trails for her to follow in the hopes that she would eventually find them.
</p><p>Marlin, Nemo, and Hank end up in the truck taking various aquatic creatures to Cleveland. Destiny and Bailey escape from their exhibit to help Dory rescue them. Once on board the truck, Dory persuades Hank to return to the sea with her, and together, they hijack the truck and drive it over busy highways, creating havoc, before crashing it into the sea, freeing all the fish. Dory, along with her parents and new friends, return to the reef with Marlin and Nemo.

Encouraged by the advice of her late father, Alice fights the Jabberwocky among the ruins surrounding the battlefield and finally jumps from the remains of a spiral staircase onto the Jabberwocky's neck and beheads it. During this fight, a catapult stone kills the Jubjub bird. As punishment for their crimes, the White Queen banishes the Red Queen and the Knave into exile together. The Knave attempts to kill the Red Queen, yet the Hatter protects the Red Queen from his attack. After the Hatter performs a celebration dance called Futterwacken, the White Queen gives Alice a vial of the Jabberwocky's purple blood whose power will bring her whatever she wishes.

</p><p>In a world populated by <a href="/wiki/Anthropomorphism" title="Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> mammals, rabbit Judy Hopps from <a href="/wiki/Rural_area" title="Rural area">rural</a> Bunnyburrow fulfills her childhood dream of becoming a <a href="/wiki/Police_officer" title="Police officer">police officer</a> in <a href="/wiki/Urban_area" title="Urban area">urban</a> Zootopia. Despite Judy being the academy <a href="/wiki/Valedictorian" title="Valedictorian">valedictorian</a>, Chief Bogo doubts her potential and delegates her to <a href="/wiki/Parking_enforcement_officer" title="Parking enforcement officer">parking duty</a>. On her first day, she is hustled by a <a href="/wiki/Confidence_trick" title="Confidence trick">con artist</a> fox duo, Nick Wilde and Finnick.
</p><p>Judy abandons parking duty to arrest Duke Weaselton, a weasel who stole a bag of <a href="/wiki/Crocus" title="Crocus">crocus</a> bulbs known as <i>Midnicampum holicithias</i>. As she is reprimanded by Bogo, an otter named Mrs. Otterton enters Bogo's office pleading for someone to find her husband Emmitt, one of fourteen <a href="/wiki/Predation" title="Predation">predators</a> who have gone missing. Bogo is forced to let a volunteering Judy take the case when Assistant Mayor Dawn Bellwether praises the assignment. He gives Judy 48 hours to find Emmitt on the condition that she must resign if she fails.
</p><p>Deducing that Nick was the last to see Emmitt, Judy blackmails him into assisting her by covertly recording his confession to <a href="/wiki/Tax_evasion" title="Tax evasion">tax evasion</a>. They track Otterton to a limousine owned by crime boss Mr. Big, who reveals Otterton went "savage"—reverted to a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Feral_animal" title="Feral animal">feral state</a>—and attacked his chauffeur Manchas. At his home, Manchas mentions Otterton yelled about "night howlers" before the attack. Manchas himself then turns savage and chases the pair. Judy saves Nick by trapping Manchas and calls the ZPD for help, but Manchas flees before they arrive. Bogo demands Judy's resignation, but Nick defends Judy and begins to bond with her over shared experiences of prejudice.
</p><p>Judy and Nick then travel to the City Hall to access to the city's traffic cameras. They discover Manchas was captured by wolves, who Judy surmises are the "night howlers". They locate the missing predators—whom have all turned savage—imprisoned at Cliffside Asylum, where Mayor Leodore Lionheart is secretly while attempting to determine the cause of their behavior. Lionheart and the asylum staff are arrested for false imprisonment, and Bellwether becomes the new mayor.
</p><p>Judy, praised for solving the case, asks Nick to join the ZPD as her partner. At her following press conference however, Judy suggests that the cause of the savage behavior is predator biology, which causes an angered Nick to refuse Judy's offer. Guilt-ridden at inciting hateful speech and discrimination against predators throughout Zootopia, Judy resigns from the ZPD and returns to Bunnyburrow.
</p><p>Back home, Judy learns that the night howlers are actually the crocus bulbs Weaselton stole, and they contain a neurotoxin that has severe <a href="/wiki/Psychoactive_drug" title="Psychoactive drug">psychotropic effects</a> on mammals which cause them to turn savage. After returning to Zootopia and reconciling with Nick, the pair confront Weaselton, whom is pressured by Mr. Big and reveals that the bulbs he stole were meant for a <a href="/wiki/Sheep" title="Sheep">ram</a> named Doug. They find Doug in a laboratory hidden in the city subway developing a drug made from night howlers, which he has been shooting at predators with a <a href="/wiki/Tranquillizer_gun" title="Tranquillizer gun">dart gun</a>.

Pocketing the ring, Bilbo finds himself confronted by Gollum. They play a riddle game, wagering that Bilbo will be shown the way out if he wins or eaten by Gollum if he loses. Bilbo eventually wins by asking Gollum what he has in his pocket. Noticing his ring is lost, Gollum realizes that Bilbo possesses it and chases him. Bilbo discovers that the ring grants him invisibility, but when he has a chance to kill Gollum, Bilbo spares his life out of pity and escapes while Gollum shouts his hatred towards the hobbit Baggins.

</p><p>Batman finds Lau in Hong Kong and brings him back to Gotham to testify, allowing Dent to apprehend the entire mob. The Joker threatens to kill people unless Batman reveals his identity, and starts by murdering Police Commissioner <a href="/wiki/Gillian_B._Loeb" title="Gillian B. Loeb">Gillian B. Loeb</a> and the judge presiding over the mob trial. The Joker also tries to kill Mayor Anthony Garcia, but Gordon sacrifices himself to stop the assassination. Dent kidnaps one of Joker’s henchmen and threatens him with a seemingly deadly game of heads or tails using Dent's lucky coin; in fact, Dent's coin has heads on both sides. Dent learns that Rachel is Joker's next target.
</p><p>Bruce decides to reveal his secret identity to prevent more deaths. Before he can, however, Dent falsely announces that <i>he</i> is Batman. Dent is taken into protective custody, but the Joker appears and attacks the convoy. Batman comes to Dent's rescue and Gordon, who faked his death, apprehends the Joker, securing a promotion to Commissioner. Rachel and Dent are escorted away by detectives on Maroni's payroll; Gordon later learns that they never arrived home. Batman interrogates the Joker, who reveals that they have been trapped in separate locations rigged with explosives and that Batman must choose one to save. Batman races to save Rachel, while Gordon attempts to rescue Dent. Batman arrives at the building, but realizes that the Joker has sent him to Dent's location instead. Both buildings explode, killing Rachel and disfiguring Dent. The Joker escapes with Lau, who leads him to the Mob's funds. The Joker burns the money and kills Lau and the Chechen.

All hospitals are evacuated and Gordon travels to secure Reese. The Joker, disguised as a hospital nurse, discovers Dent's ward and hands him a gun, convincing him to seek revenge for Rachel's death. The Joker destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. Dent goes on a killing spree, deciding the fates of people he holds responsible for Rachel's death by flipping his lucky coin, one face of which was corroded in the explosion. Dent eventually apprehends Gordon's family, believing Gordon's love for his family parallels his love for Rachel.
</p><p>After announcing that Gotham City will be subject to his rule by nightfall, the Joker rigs two evacuating ferries with explosives; one carrying civilians and the other prisoners. The passengers have been supplied with a trigger to the other boat's explosives, and the Joker announces through an intercom that he will blow both ferries if one of them has not been destroyed by midnight. Batman finds the Joker by using a sonar device that spies on the entire city, with the reluctant help of <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Fox" title="Lucius Fox">Lucius Fox</a>. The civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while Batman apprehends the Joker after a fight.

</p><p>Gordon and Batman arrive at the building where Rachel died and find Dent threatening to kill Gordon's family. Dent again flips his coin and shoots Batman, spares himself, and aims to kill Gordon's son, claiming that Gordon's negligence is responsible for Rachel's death. Batman, who was wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the building to his death. Batman persuades Gordon to let him take responsibility for the killing spree to preserve Dent's heroic image.

Ten years later, Harry has been battling a disjointed life with the Dursleys. After inadvertently causing an accident during a family trip to the zoo, Harry begins receiving unsolicited letters by owls. After the Dursleys escape to an island to avoid more letters, Hagrid re-appears and informs Harry that he is actually a wizard and has been accepted into Hogwarts against the Dursleys' wishes. After taking Harry to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Diagon_Alley" title="Diagon Alley">Diagon Alley</a> to buy his supplies for Hogwarts and a pet owl named Hedwig as a birthday present, Hagrid informs him of his past; Harry's parents <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix_(fictional_organisation)" title="Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)">James and Lily Potter</a> met their demise via a <a href="/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter#Unforgivable_Curses" title="Magic in Harry Potter">Killing Curse</a> at the hands of the malevolent and all-powerful wizard: <a href="/wiki/Lord_Voldemort" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a>. Harry, the only survivor in the chaos, thus becomes well-known in the wizarding world as "The Boy Who Lived".
</p><p>Harry is then taken to <a href="/wiki/London_King%27s_Cross_railway_station" title="London King's Cross railway station">King's Cross station</a> to board a train to Hogwarts, where he meets three other students: <a href="/wiki/Ron_Weasley" title="Ron Weasley">Ron Weasley</a>, whom he quickly befriends; <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a>, an intelligent witch born to <a href="/wiki/Muggle" title="Muggle">muggle</a> parents; and <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>, a boy from a wealthy wizarding family, with whom he immediately clashes. After arriving at school the students assemble in the Great Hall, where all the first-years are sorted by the <a href="/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Sorting_Hat" title="Magical objects in Harry Potter">Sorting Hat</a> between four houses: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hufflepuff" title="Hufflepuff">Hufflepuff</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ravenclaw" title="Ravenclaw">Ravenclaw</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a>. Although the Sorting Hat considers putting Harry in Slytherin with Draco, he is placed into Gryffindor alongside Ron and Hermione.
</p><p>At Hogwarts, Harry begins learning magic spells and discovers more about his past and parents. After recovering the <a href="/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Remembrall" title="Magical objects in Harry Potter">Remembrall</a> of Gryffindor student <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a>, Harry is recruited for Gryffindor's <a href="/wiki/Quidditch" title="Quidditch">Quidditch</a> team as a Seeker, an extremely rare feat for first-year students. On their way to the dorms one night the stair cases change paths leading the three to the forbidden floor of Hogwarts, Harry, Ron, and Hermione discover a <a href="/wiki/Cerberus" title="Cerberus">giant three-headed dog</a> named Fluffy in a restricted area of the school. Ron then insults Hermione after being embarrassed by her in a charms lesson, causing Hermione to lock herself in the girls' bathroom. She is attacked by a marauding troll, but Harry and Ron save her - befriending her in the process.
</p><p>The children later find out Fluffy is guarding the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Philosopher's Stone">Philosopher's Stone</a>, an object that has the power to turn any metal into <a href="/wiki/Gold" title="Gold">gold</a> and produce a <a href="/wiki/Elixir_of_life" title="Elixir of life">potion that grants immortality</a>. Harry suspects that potions teacher and head of Slytherin House <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> is trying to obtain the stone in order to return Voldemort to physical form. Hagrid accidentally reveals to the trio that Fluffy will fall asleep if played music. Harry, Ron, and Hermione decide that night to try and find the stone before Snape. They discover an already asleep Fluffy and face a series of safeguards including a deadly plant known as Devil's Snare, a room filled with aggressive flying keys that bruise Harry, and a dangerous life-sized game of <a href="/wiki/Chess" title="Chess">chess</a> that almost kills Ron.
</p><p>After getting past the tasks, Harry discovers that it was <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> teacher <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Quirinus Quirrell</a> who was trying to claim the stone: Snape had actually been protecting Harry all along. Quirrell removes his turban and reveals a weak Voldemort living on the back of his head. Through an enchantment placed by Dumbledore, Harry finds the stone in his possession. Voldemort attempts to bargain the stone from Harry in exchange for reviving his parents, but Harry refuses. Quirrell attempts to kill Harry in response; however, he is instead killed after Harry ends up burning his skin - reducing Quirrell to dust and causing Voldemort's to rise from his ashes. Harry is knocked unconscious in the process.
</p><p>Harry recovers in the school hospital with Dumbledore at his side. Dumbledore explains that the stone has been destroyed and that Ron and Hermione are safe. Dumbledore also reveals how Harry was able to defeat Quirrell: when Harry's mother died to save him, her death gave Harry a love-based protection against Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances - tying them for first place with Slytherin. Dumbledore then awards ten points to Neville for attempting to stop the trio, granting Gryffindor the House Cup. Harry returns home for the summer, happy to finally have a real home in Hogwarts.
</p><p>A mysterious vehicle using a giant magnet steals a highly potent mutagen known as PX-41 from a secret laboratory in the Arctic Circle. The Anti-Villain League (AVL), led by Silas Ramsbottom, sends one of his agents, Lucy Wilde to collect Gru, who was former super-villain. Meanwhile, at Gru's house, it is one of his daughters Agnes's birthday and hosts a party for her, Later Lucy Wilde uses her lipstick taser to get Gru to the AVL headquarters, two minions witness the kidnapping and try to save Gru but get electrocuted by Lucy, When they make it at the AVL Silas Ramsbottom introduces himself (much to Gru and the minions amusement) and tells him he was taken there to track down the culprit of the person who stole the lab and recover the mutagen. However, Gru refuses, claiming that he is now a legitimate businessman of making jelly out of every fruit there is but the jelly turns out to taste horrible and the devoted father to Margo, Edith, and Agnes. Longing to resume his criminal life, Dr. Nefario, Gru's friend and assistant, leaves Gru for new employment. Gru reluctantly agrees to investigate the theft and works with undercover AVL agent Lucy Wilde.
</p><p>The pair begin their search in the Paradise Shopping Mall, disguised as bakery employees. Gru immediately suspects the Mexican restaurant owner, Eduardo Pérez, of being the infamous "El Macho", a legendary super-villain who supposedly died by riding a shark into the mouth of an active volcano with 250 pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest. Gru and Lucy break into Eduardo's restaurant at night but find no proof. Meanwhile, Agnes, who dreams of having a mother one day, believes that Gru will fall in love with Lucy. Gru denies it, saying his relationship with Lucy is only professional.
</p><p>Although holding Eduardo as his prime suspect, Gru agrees to pursue others, including wig merchant Floyd Eagle-san. After witnessing Eduardo's two-timing son, Antonio, woo Margo and invite everyone to his Cinco de Mayo party, Gru renews his focus on Eduardo. His neighbor, Jillian, sets him up on a dinner date with her vacuous friend Shannon. The date goes awry, but Lucy arrives and rescues Gru from being humiliated by shooting Shannon with a tranquilizer gun. While they take Shannon home, Gru and Lucy spend personal time together, and Gru falls in love with her.
</p><p>The next day, the AVL arrest Eagle-san after finding an almost-empty jar of the mutagen in his shop, and the investigation is closed by Ramsbottom. Lucy is reassigned to Australia and gives Gru her lipstick taser as a gift before leaving. A heartbroken Gru, having lacked the courage to ask Lucy out on a date, instead takes the girls to the Cinco de Mayo party. There, he follows Eduardo and discovers a secret musical steps-activated elevator, where he finally finds proof that Eduardo is El Macho.
</p><p>On her flight, Lucy, realizing that she has also fallen in love with Gru, jumps out of the plane and uses a hang-glider to reach the party. Gru discovers that El Macho, who has hired Nefario as a partner, has been abducting Gru's Minions and using the stolen PX-41 serum to make them rabid and indestructible. El Macho plans to launch rockets full of the mutated Minions into major cities in order to dominate the world. He offers Gru the chance to team up with him, but Gru walks away and El Macho sends one of his minions after him.
</p><p>Gru takes the girls home and finds a heartbroken Margo as Antonio has chosen another girl to dance with other than her and Gru freezes him, Lucy later arrives at the party right after Gru leaves, but El Macho captures Lucy after Pollito, El Macho's pet chicken, retrieves her AVL ID badge from her purse. Nefario rejoins Gru and tells him that Lucy has been captured, Gru goes back to his fortress with two of his own minions. Meanwhile, back at Gru's house, The minion that El Macho released finds his home and attacks the girls, but Nefario comes to their rescue as he had created an antidote to the serum and puts it in the jelly. Gru enters the fortress with two disguised minions covered with purple paint pretending to be captured to help him enter El Macho's fortress, but one of the minions wipe some paint of his face with his glove revealing to all the purple minions that he is not one of them and the kidnapping was fake, therefore the purple minions attack and corner them, Luckily Nefario, the girls and the rest of Gru's minions who are in normal state arrive with the antidote and returned all the Minions to their normal state. El Macho then applies the mutagen on himself and turns into a monster, but Gru and Nefario defeat him using Lucy's lipstick taser and a fart gun.
</p><p>Gru finds Lucy strapped to a TNT-loaded shark rocket and starts to untie her, but Pollito launches the rocket, sending it flying towards the same volcano where El Macho previously faked his death. Lucy accepts Gru's invitation for a date, and the pair dive into the ocean seconds before the rocket enters the volcano and violently explodes. Gru rejoins the AVL, and he and Lucy eventually get married, giving Margo, Edith and Agnes a mother and it is revealed that there was still one minion that the PX-41 antidote was never given to him.

He informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing that the king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge. Scar refuses to help Mufasa, instead sending him falling to his death. He then convinces Simba that the tragedy was Simba's own fault and advises him to leave the kingdom and never return. He orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing his three hyena minions and the rest of their large pack to live in the Pride Lands.

Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He then encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his rightful place as king. Realizing that he can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.

Scar taunts Simba over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to him that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame the hyenas for his actions; Simba spares his life, but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever (just like Scar demanded Simba to do when he was a cub). Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to toss him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. Afterwards, Simba takes over the kingship as rain begins to fall. He also makes Nala his queen.
</p><p>Later, with Pride Rock restored to its usual state, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of life.

Bagheera trains Mowgli to learn the ways of the wolves, but the boy faces certain challenges and falls behind his wolf siblings, while Akela objects of him using human "tricks", like building tools, instead of learning the ways of the pack.
</p><p>One day, during the <a href="/wiki/Dry_season" title="Dry season">dry season</a>, the jungle animals gather to drink the water that remains as part of a truce during a drought that enables the jungle's wildlife to drink without fear of being eaten by their predators. The truce is disrupted when a fire-scarred <a href="/wiki/Bengal_tiger" title="Bengal tiger">Bengal tiger</a> named <a href="/wiki/Shere_Khan" title="Shere Khan">Shere Khan</a> arrives, detecting Mowgli's scent in the large crowd. Consumed by a vendetta on humans for scarring him with <a href="/wiki/Fire" title="Fire">fire</a> during a hunt, he threatens to kill Mowgli at the end of the drought. After the drought ends, the wolves debate whether they should keep Mowgli or not. Mowgli decides to leave the jungle for the safety of his pack. Bagheera agrees with the decision and volunteers to guide him to the nearby man village.
</p><p>En route, Shere Khan ambushes them and injures Bagheera, but Mowgli manages to escape. Later, Mowgli meets an enormous <a href="/wiki/Pythonidae" title="Pythonidae">python</a> named <a href="/wiki/Kaa" title="Kaa">Kaa</a>, who hypnotizes him. While under her influence, Mowgli sees a vision of his father being killed by Shere Khan while protecting him, which also warns of the destructive power of the "red flower" (fire). Kaa attempts to devour Mowgli, but she is attacked by a <a href="/wiki/Himalayan_brown_bear" title="Himalayan brown bear">himalayan brown bear</a> named <a href="/wiki/Baloo" title="Baloo">Baloo</a> who rescues the unconscious Mowgli. Mowgli later awakens and retrievies some difficult-to-access honey for Baloo as repayment, with the two bonding in the process. Mowgli agrees to stay with Baloo until the winter season arrives. Meanwhile, upon learning that Mowgli has left the jungle, Shere Khan throws Akela off to his death and threatens the pack to lure Mowgli out.
</p><p>Bagheera eventually finds Mowgli and Baloo and is shocked that Mowgli has not joined the humans as he had agreed, but Baloo calms him down and persuades both of them to sleep on it. During the night, Mowgli finds a herd of <a href="/wiki/Indian_elephant" title="Indian elephant">Indian elephants</a> gathered around a ditch and uses vines to save their baby ditch. Although Baloo and Bagheera are impressed, Baloo realizes that he cannot guarantee Mowgli's safety after learning that he is being hunted by Shere Khan. Baloo agrees to push Mowgli away to get him to continue onward to the man village.
</p><p>Mowgli is kidnapped by a gang of monkeys known as the "<a href="/wiki/Bandar-log" title="Bandar-log">Bandar-log</a>", who present him to their leader, a deranged <a href="/wiki/Gigantopithecus" title="Gigantopithecus">Gigantopithecus</a> named <a href="/wiki/King_Louie" title="King Louie">King Louie</a>. Assuming that all humans can make fire, King Louie offers Mowgli protection from Shere Khan in exchange for it. Baloo decoys King Louie while Bagheera tries to sneak him out, but their plan is found out. As King Louie chases Mowgli through his temple, he informs Mowgli of Akela's death. King Louie's rampage eventually causes his temple to collapse on top of him.
</p><p>Furious that Baloo and Bagheera neglected to tell him about Akela's death, Mowgli goes to confront Shere Khan alone. He steals a lit torch at the village to use as a weapon and heads back to the jungle, accidentally starting a wildfire in the process. He confronts Shere Khan, who argues that Mowgli has made himself the enemy of the jungle by causing the wildfire. Mowgli throws the torch into the water, giving Shere Khan the advantage. Baloo, Bagheera, and the wolf pack intervene and hold Shere Khan off, giving Mowgli enough time to set a trap. He lures Shere Khan up a dead tree and onto a branch, which breaks under the tiger's weight, and Shere Khan falls into the fire to his death. Mowgli then directs the elephants to divert the river and put out the fire.
In the aftermath, Raksha becomes the new leader of the wolf pack. Mowgli decides to utilize his equipment and tricks for his own use, having found his true home and calling with his wolf family, Baloo and Bagheera.

</p><p>In Brantford, <a href="/wiki/New_Hampshire" title="New Hampshire">New Hampshire</a> (1996), teenager Alex Vreeke is given the Jumanji <a href="/wiki/Board_game" title="Board game">board game</a> by his father, who found it on a beach. Uninterested, he sets the game aside. That night, it transforms into a <a href="/wiki/Video_game" title="Video game">video game</a> <a href="/wiki/ROM_cartridge" title="ROM cartridge">cartridge</a> which catches Alex's attention when he is awakened by the Jumanji drum beats. When he begins playing it, he disappears into the game.
</p><p>Twenty years later, four students at Brantford High School are given detention: Spencer Gilpin and his ex-best friend Anthony "Fridge" Johnson for cheating, Bethany Walker for making a phone call during class, and Martha Kaply for talking back to her gym teacher and refusing to participate. In the school basement, where they are serving their detention, Fridge discovers Alex's discarded video-game system, and he and Spencer decide to play. Although it has five <a href="/wiki/Avatar_(computing)" title="Avatar (computing)">playable characters</a>, they are unable to select the first one, so they choose two others, and convince the girls to play as the remaining two. When Spencer presses "Start", the four are sucked into the game.
</p><p>They land in a jungle, in the forms of their game avatars. Spencer is a tough, muscular explorer and archaeologist named Dr. Smolder Bravestone; Fridge is a diminutive zoologist named Franklin "Mouse" Finbar; Bethany is an overweight male cartographer named Professor Sheldon Oberon; and Martha is a female commando and martial arts expert named Ruby Roundhouse. They each have three lives marked on their arms and Bethany immediately loses one after being eaten by a hippo. Spencer deduces that if they lose all three, they die for real.
</p><p>They learn the game's story from <a href="/wiki/Non-player_character" title="Non-player character">NPC</a> Nigel: corrupt archeologist Russel Van Pelt stole the Jaguar's Eye, a magic jewel, from its shrine, cursing Jumanji. Nigel escaped Van Pelt with the jewel, and the players must return it to a jaguar statue to lift the curse, and call "Jumanji" to leave the game. Nigel warns them that Van Pelt will stop at nothing to retrieve the jewel, which gives him control of Jumanji's animals; Van Pelt himself is possessed by its power. They begin tackling the game's increasingly-difficult "levels", losing lives as they do so. The four are rescued by Alex, the missing fifth player, whose avatar is pilot Jefferson "Seaplane" McDonough. Taking shelter in a jungle house built by the game's previous player Alan Parrish, Alex believes that he has been in the game for a few months and is distressed to learn that it is really twenty years. The newcomers vow to help him return home. They break into a transportation shed, commandeering a <a href="/wiki/Helicopter" title="Helicopter">helicopter</a> to fly to the jaguar statue and return the jewel, but Fridge drops the jewel into a herd of rhinos. Spencer sacrifices one of Fridge's lives, pushing him out of the helicopter as a distraction, and retrieves the jewel. Alex loses his last life when a mosquito bites him, but Bethany performs <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CPR" title="CPR">CPR</a> and transfers one of her lives to him.
</p><p>At the statue, the players are surrounded by a pack of jaguars and Van Pelt's forces. They outmaneuver their opposition while Spencer and Martha race to the statue. Van Pelt confronts Martha and demands the jewel, but she purposely gets a snake to bite her, allowing her to respawn and to get the jewel to Spencer. Now on their last lives, the players end the game, with Van Pelt disintegrating into a bunch of <a href="/wiki/Rat" title="Rat">rats</a>, and return to the school basement, though without Alex. They find the formerly-dilapidated Vreeke home restored and decorated for a Christmas family gathering. An adult Alex arrives, having returned to 1996 when the game ended. Now married with children, he reveals he named his eldest daughter after Bethany out of gratitude for saving his life.
</p><p>Spencer and Fridge reconcile, Bethany begins caring for others more than herself and plans a summer wilderness backpacking adventure, Martha and Spencer become romantically involved and the four are now friends after their experiences in the game. When they hear Jumanji's drumbeats, they bring the game behind the school and Fridge destroys it with a bowling ball to prevent anyone from playing it.

While being pursued by the Wood-elves, they are ambushed by Bolg and his Orc party, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/K%C3%ADli" title="Kíli">Kíli</a> is wounded with a <a href="/wiki/Middle-earth_weapons_and_armour#Knives" title="Middle-earth weapons and armour">Morgul shaft</a>. They engage in a running three-way battle down the river, but ultimately the Dwarves are able to escape both groups of pursuers. Thranduil then seals off his kingdom when an Orc captive reveals an evil entity has returned and is amassing an army in the south, but Tauriel decides to leave and assist the Dwarves, and Legolas goes after her. Meanwhile, Gandalf and <a href="/wiki/Radagast" title="Radagast">Radagast</a> go to investigate the tombs of the <a href="/wiki/Nazg%C3%BBl" title="Nazgûl">Nazgûl</a>, which they find to be empty.
</p><p>The company are smuggled into <a href="/wiki/Esgaroth" title="Esgaroth">Esgaroth</a> by a bargeman called <a href="/wiki/Bard_the_Bowman" title="Bard the Bowman">Bard</a>, but are discovered raiding the town armory for new weapons. Thorin promises the Master, his councilor Alfrid, and the people of Laketown a share of the mountain's treasure, and it is revealed that Bard is a descendant of the last ruler of Dale, and possesses the last black arrow capable of killing Smaug. Kíli is forced to remain behind, tended to by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_Middle-earth_Dwarves#Fíli" title="List of Middle-earth Dwarves">Fíli</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_Middle-earth_Dwarves#Óin,_son_of_Glóin" title="List of Middle-earth Dwarves">Óin</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_Middle-earth_Dwarves#Bofur" title="List of Middle-earth Dwarves">Bofur</a>, as the remaining company receive a grand farewell. Meanwhile, Gandalf travels south to the ruins of <a href="/wiki/Dol_Guldur" title="Dol Guldur">Dol Guldur</a>, while Radagast leaves to warn <a href="/wiki/Galadriel" title="Galadriel">Galadriel</a> of their discovery at the tombs of the Nazgûl. Gandalf finds the ruins infested with Orcs and is ambushed by Azog. The Necromancer overpowers Gandalf and reveals himself as <a href="/wiki/Sauron" title="Sauron">Sauron</a>.
</p><p>Thorin and his remaining company reach the <a href="/wiki/Lonely_Mountain" title="Lonely Mountain">Lonely Mountain</a>, where Bilbo discovers the hidden entrance. He is sent in to retrieve the Arkenstone, and while doing so, he accidentally awakens Smaug. While trying to find Bilbo, Smaug reveals his knowledge of Sauron's return. Back in Laketown, Bard attempts to bring the black arrow to the town's launcher, as he fears what may happen when the Dwarves enter the mountain. However, he is arrested by the Master and Alfrid in the process and leaves his son to hide the arrow. Bolg and his Orc party infiltrate the town and attack the four Dwarves, but are quickly dispatched by Tauriel and Legolas. Tauriel then tends to Kíli, while Legolas leaves in pursuit of Bolg. Meanwhile, Gandalf watches helplessly as Azog and an Orc army march from Dol Guldur towards the Lonely Mountain.
</p><p>Back inside the mountain, during a long chase, Bilbo and the Dwarves rekindle the mountain's forge using Smaug's flames to create and melt a large golden statue of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thr%C3%B3r" title="Thrór">Thrór</a>, hoping to bury Smaug alive in the molten gold. They do so, but Smaug emerges from the gold, storms out of the mountain and <a href="/wiki/The_Hobbit:_The_Battle_of_the_Five_Armies" title="The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies">flies off to destroy Laketown</a> as Bilbo watches in horror.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins" title="Bilbo Baggins">Bilbo</a> and the Dwarves watch from the <a href="/wiki/Lonely_Mountain" title="Lonely Mountain">Lonely Mountain</a> as the dragon <a href="/wiki/Smaug" title="Smaug">Smaug</a> sets <a href="/wiki/Esgaroth" title="Esgaroth">Laketown</a> ablaze. <a href="/wiki/Bard_the_Bowman" title="Bard the Bowman">Bard</a> breaks out of prison, and eventually kills Smaug with the <a href="/wiki/Middle-earth_weapons_and_armour#Black_Arrow" title="Middle-earth weapons and armour">black arrow</a> brought to him by his son <a href="/wiki/List_of_kings_of_Dale" title="List of kings of Dale">Bain</a>. Smaug's falling body crushes the fleeing Master of Laketown and his cronies, who were escaping on a boat laden with the town's gold. Bard reluctantly becomes the new leader of the people of Laketown, with the Master's conniving servant, Alfrid, acting as Bard's reluctant servant, as they seek refuge in the ruins of Dale, while <a href="/wiki/Legolas" title="Legolas">Legolas</a> travels to investigate <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_minor_places_in_Middle-earth#Mount_Gundabad" title="List of minor places in Middle-earth">Mount Gundabad</a> with <a href="/wiki/Tauriel" title="Tauriel">Tauriel</a>. Thorin, now struck with "dragon sickness" over the vast treasure in the mountain, searches obsessively for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arkenstone" title="Arkenstone">Arkenstone</a>, which Bilbo had previously found but kept hidden. Thorin, hearing that Laketown survivors have fled to Dale, orders the entrance of the Lonely Mountain sealed off.
</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Galadriel" title="Galadriel">Galadriel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elrond" title="Elrond">Elrond</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Saruman" title="Saruman">Saruman</a> arrive at <a href="/wiki/Dol_Guldur" title="Dol Guldur">Dol Guldur</a> and free <a href="/wiki/Gandalf" title="Gandalf">Gandalf</a>, sending him to safety with <a href="/wiki/Radagast" title="Radagast">Radagast</a>. They battle and defeat the <a href="/wiki/Nazg%C3%BBl" title="Nazgûl">Nazgûl</a> and a formless <a href="/wiki/Sauron" title="Sauron">Sauron</a> himself, banishing them to the East. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Azog" title="Azog">Azog</a>, marching on Erebor with his vast Orc army, sends his son <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bolg" title="Bolg">Bolg</a> to Gundabad to summon their second army. Legolas and Tauriel witness the march of Bolg's army, bolstered by Orc berserkers and giant bats.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Thranduil" title="Thranduil">Thranduil</a> and an Elf army arrive in Dale and form an alliance with Bard in order to reclaim a treasure once withheld from them by <a href="/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#Thrór" title="Middle-earth dwarf characters">Thrór</a>. Bard goes to the mountain and asks Thorin for the share of gold that he had previously promised the people of Laketown, but Thorin refuses. Gandalf arrives at Dale to warn Bard and Thranduil of the threat posed by Azog, but Thranduil dismisses him. Bilbo sneaks out of Erebor to hand the Arkenstone over to Thranduil and Bard so that they can trade it for the treasures they were promised and prevent a battle. When Bard's and Thranduil's armies gather at the gates of Erebor, offering to trade the Arkenstone for the promised treasures, Thorin angrily refuses to believe they have the Arkenstone until Bilbo admits giving it away and chides Thorin for letting greed cloud his judgement. Outraged by what he sees as betrayal, Thorin nearly kills Bilbo, but Gandalf appears and shames Thorin into releasing Bilbo. Thorin's cousin <a href="/wiki/D%C3%A1in_II_Ironfoot" title="Dáin II Ironfoot">Dáin</a> arrives with his Dwarf army, and a battle of Dwarves against Elves and Men ensues, until <a href="/wiki/Wereworms" title="Wereworms">Wereworms</a> emerge from the ground, releasing Azog's army from their tunnels. With the Orcs outnumbering Dáin's army, Thranduil and Bard's forces, along with Gandalf and Bilbo, join the battle, fighting the Orcs. However, a second front is opened when many Orcs, Ogres, and Trolls attack Dale, forcing Bard to withdraw his forces to defend the city, while Alfrid takes a bunch of gold and flees from Dale to his ultimate fate.
</p><p>Inside Erebor, Thorin suffers traumatic hallucinations before regaining his sanity and leading his company to join the battle. He rides towards <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ravenhill_(Middle-earth)" title="Ravenhill (Middle-earth)">Ravenhill</a> with Dwalin, Fíli, and Kíli to kill Azog; Bilbo follows them, using <a href="/wiki/One_Ring" title="One Ring">his magic ring</a> to move through the combat unseen. Meanwhile, Tauriel and Legolas arrive to warn the Dwarves of Bolg's approaching army. Fíli is captured, and Azog kills him as Bilbo and the other Dwarves are forced to watch. As Thorin engages Azog in a fight to the death, Bolg knocks Bilbo unconscious, overpowers Tauriel and then kills Kíli, who had come to her aid. Legolas battles Bolg and eventually kills him. Thorin kills Azog, but is fatally wounded in the process. The <a href="/wiki/Eagle_(Middle-earth)" title="Eagle (Middle-earth)">Great Eagles</a> arrive with Radagast and <a href="/wiki/Beorn" title="Beorn">Beorn</a> to fight the newly arriving Orc army, and the Orcs are finally defeated. Bilbo regains consciousness and makes peace with the dying Thorin. Tauriel mourns Kili, and Thranduil acknowledges their love. Legolas then tells Thranduil he must leave, and Thranduil advises him to seek out a Dunedain ranger in the north who goes by the name <a href="/wiki/Aragorn" title="Aragorn">"Strider"</a>.
</p><p>As Thorin's company begin settling back into Erebor (with Dáin now the king), and Dale begins to recover with Bard as the leader, Bilbo bids farewell to the company's remaining members and journeys home to <a href="/wiki/Shire_(Middle-earth)" title="Shire (Middle-earth)">the Shire</a> with Gandalf. As the two part ways on the outskirts of the Shire, Gandalf admits his knowledge of Bilbo's ring and warns him that magic rings are not to be used lightly. Bilbo returns to Bag End to find his belongings being auctioned off because he was presumed dead. He cancels the sale, but finds his home pillaged; he starts to tidy up and to settle back in. <a href="/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring" title="The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring">Sixty years later</a>, Bilbo receives a visit from Gandalf on his 111th birthday.
</p><p>Nemo is a young and cheerful <a href="/wiki/Amphiprioninae" title="Amphiprioninae">clownfish</a> who lives happily with his father, Marlin in the <a href="/wiki/Great_Barrier_Reef" title="Great Barrier Reef">Great Barrier Reef</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a> and is eager to explore life around the ocean, but Marlin appears to be too overprotective of him, due to a <a href="/wiki/Barracuda" title="Barracuda">barracuda</a> attack that killed his wife Coral and his clutch of eggs. On the first day of school, Marlin embarrasses Nemo during a field trip. When Marlin talks to the teacher, Mr. Ray, Nemo sneaks away from the reef and is captured by a scuba diver, who puts him on a boat. Marlin chases after it and meets Dory, a <a href="/wiki/Paracanthurus" title="Paracanthurus">blue tang</a> who suffers from short term memory loss. The pair encounter three sharks named <a href="/wiki/Great_white_shark" title="Great white shark">Bruce</a>, <a href="/wiki/Hammerhead_shark" title="Hammerhead shark">Anchor</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mako_shark" title="Mako shark">Chum</a>. While at their meeting, Marlin sees the diver's mask that fell from the boat that took Nemo and also sees strange writing on it. However, Marlin and Dory fight over the mask, giving Dory a nose bleed. The blood sends Bruce into a feeding frenzy, and attacks Marlin and Dory, who narrowly escape.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Nemo is placed in an <a href="/wiki/Aquarium" title="Aquarium">aquarium</a> in a dentist's office, where he meets the Tank Gang, including <a href="/wiki/Yellow_tang" title="Yellow tang">yellow tang</a> Bubbles, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sea_star" title="Sea star">sea star</a> Peach, <a href="/wiki/Lysmata_amboinensis" title="Lysmata amboinensis">cleaner shrimp</a> Jacques, <a href="/wiki/Porcupinefish" title="Porcupinefish">blowfish</a> Bloat, <a href="/wiki/Royal_gramma" title="Royal gramma">royal gramma</a> Gurgle, and <a href="/wiki/Dascyllus_melanurus" title="Dascyllus melanurus">blue and white humbug</a> Deb, led by Gill, a <a href="/wiki/Moorish_idol" title="Moorish idol">Moorish idol</a>. That night, Nemo learns he is to be given to the dentist's niece, Darla, who has killed previous fish given to her, including a <a href="/wiki/Goldfish" title="Goldfish">goldfish</a> named Chuckles. Gill devises a plan to escape by having a random fish in the aquarium jam the aquarium's <a href="/wiki/Filter_(aquarium)" title="Filter (aquarium)">filter</a> with a pebble so the dentist will have to put the fish into plastic bags while the tank gets cleaned, then roll out the window and into the harbor. Nemo volunteers to do it, and Gill lets him do it. Nemo attempts to jam the filter but fails, and everybody saves him.
</p><p>The mask falls into a trench in the <a href="/wiki/Deep_sea" title="Deep sea">deep sea</a>, where Dory reads the address as "P. Sherman, 42 Wallaby Way, <a href="/wiki/Sydney" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>". She remembers it despite her short term memory loss. Dory and Marlin receive directions from a school of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Silver_moony" title="Silver moony">moonfish</a>. They are supposed to swim through a trench, but they end swimming over it, where they encounter a forest of <a href="/wiki/Jellyfish" title="Jellyfish">jellyfish</a> that almost stings them, but they remain okay. Marlin and Dory find themselves on the <a href="/wiki/East_Australian_Current" title="East Australian Current">East Australian Current</a> and have a good time with Crush, a <a href="/wiki/Green_sea_turtle" title="Green sea turtle">green sea turtle</a>, his son, Squirt, and all the turtles there. Marlin tells the story of his journey to the turtles, who are impressed. News of his quest spreads across the ocean. A <a href="/wiki/Pelican" title="Pelican">pelican</a> named Nigel flies to the dentist's office and brings news of Marlin's efforts to find Nemo, who makes another attempt to jam the filter, and succeeds get the aquarium covered in green <a href="/wiki/Algae" title="Algae">algae</a>.
</p><p>Marlin and Dory exit the East Australian Current and are engulfed by a <a href="/wiki/Blue_whale" title="Blue whale">blue whale</a>. Dory communicates with the whale, who carries them to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sydney_Harbor" title="Sydney Harbor">Sydney Harbor</a> and expels them through his blowhole. There, they meet Nigel the pelican, who help the pair escape from a group of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Seagulls" title="Seagulls">seagulls</a> and takes them to the dentist's office. Meanwhile, the dentist has installed a new high-tech filter and the Tank Gang fail to escape. Darla arrives, and the dentist hands Nemo to her. Nemo plays dead to save himself as Nigel arrives, terrifying Darla and throwing the office into chaos. After the dentist throws Nigel out, Gill helps Nemo escape into a drain that leads to the ocean.
</p><p>Thinking that Nemo is dead, Marlin abandons Dory and goes home, causing her to forget. However, she meets Nemo when he reaches the ocean, but has lost her memory. Dory's memory returns when she reads the word Sydney on a drainpipe. She reunites Nemo with Marlin, but is caught in a net with a school of <a href="/wiki/Grouper" title="Grouper">grouper</a>. Nemo enters the net and orders the fish to swim down in order to break the net and they escape. After returning home to the reef, Marlin and Dory watch Mr Ray take Nemo and his friends on a field trip.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the dentist's new filter breaks down, and the Tank Gang escape unnoticed into Sydney Harbour.

The building also serves as the headquarters of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix_(fictional_organisation)" title="Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)">Order of the Phoenix</a>, a secret organisation founded by <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> which informs Harry that the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic" title="Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> is refusing to believe <a href="/wiki/Lord_Voldemort" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a>'s return. At the Order's headquarters, Sirius mentions that Voldemort is after a special object he did not have during his previous attack.
</p><p>Harry's expulsion is reversed at a hearing of the Ministry of Magic and he returns to Hogwarts for his fifth year, where Minister of Magic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">Cornelius Fudge</a> has appointed a new <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> professor: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>. Umbridge immediately clashes with Harry and punishes him for his "lies" about Voldemort by forcing him to write a message with a magic quill, scarring his hand. Despite the concern of his best friends <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ron_Weasley" title="Ron Weasley">Ron Weasley</a>, Harry refuses to report Umbridge's punishment to Dumbledore, who has mysteriously been ignoring Harry since the summer. As Umbridge's control over the school increases, Harry, Hermione and Ron form a secret group to train students in defensive spells, calling themselves "<a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore's Army">Dumbledore's Army</a>". Umbridge tasks the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a> students with exposing the group, forming the "Inquisitorial Squad". Meanwhile, Harry and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cho_Chang" title="Cho Chang">Cho Chang</a> develop romantic feelings for each other.
</p><p>Harry has a vision involving an attack upon <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a>, from the point of view of Arthur's attacker. Concerned that Voldemort will exploit this connection to Harry, Dumbledore instructs <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> to give Harry <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Occlumency" title="Occlumency">Occlumency</a> lessons to defend his mind from Voldemort's influence. These end after Harry discovers through Snape's memories why Snape hated Harry's father James (who often ridiculed him). The connection causes Harry to further isolate himself from his friends. Meanwhile, Sirius' deranged <a href="/wiki/Death_Eater" title="Death Eater">Death Eater</a> cousin <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a> escapes from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> along with nine other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>. At Hogwarts, Umbridge and her "Inquisitorial Squad" expose Dumbledore's Army by forcing Cho to drink <a href="/wiki/Potions_in_Harry_Potter#Veritaserum" title="Potions in Harry Potter">Veritaserum</a>. Dumbledore escapes as Fudge orders his arrest. Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress.
</p><p>Harry's refusal to forgive Cho causes their relationship to fall apart. After seeing another vision where Sirius is tortured by Voldemort, Harry, Ron and Hermione rush to Umbridge's fireplace to alert the Order via the Floo Network but are caught by her. When Umbridge threatens to use the <a href="/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter#Unforgivable_Curses" title="Magic in Harry Potter">Cruciatus Curse</a> on Harry, Hermione tricks her into entering the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts#Forbidden_Forest" title="Hogwarts">Forbidden Forest</a> in search of Dumbledore's "secret weapon".

However, they are ambushed by Death Eaters led by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy" title="Lucius Malfoy">Lucius Malfoy</a> and Bellatrix. Lucius reveals that Harry only saw a dream of Sirius being tortured, which served as a ruse to lure Harry into the Death Eaters' grasp.

</p><p>The Death Eaters capture everyone except Harry, threatening to kill them unless he surrenders the prophecy. As Harry obliges, the Order arrive and attack the Death Eaters. This causes Lucius to drop the prophecy, destroying it. Just as Sirius overpowers Lucius, he is killed by Bellatrix. Voldemort appears, but Dumbledore arrives through the Floo Network moments before he can kill Harry. A duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore ensues, which destroys much of the Atrium while Bellatrix escapes. Unable to defeat Dumbledore, Voldemort possesses Harry to tempt Dumbledore into sacrificing him but the love Harry feels for his friends and Sirius makes it impossible for Voldemort to remain in his body.
</p><p>Ministry officials arrive right before Voldemort <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Apparition_(Harry_Potter)" title="Apparition (Harry Potter)">disapparates</a>; Fudge is forced to admit Voldemort's return and is forced out of his position as Minister in disgrace.

He asks Harry to confront Slughorn and retrieve the real memory, after being given an altered version that made it appear as though Slughorn did not know anything. Harry is unable to convince Slughorn.
</p><p>After Ron accidentally ingests a <a href="/wiki/Potions_in_Harry_Potter#Amortentia" title="Potions in Harry Potter">love potion</a> intended for Harry, Harry cures him with Slughorn's help. The trio celebrate with <a href="/wiki/Mead" title="Mead">mead</a> that Slughorn had intended to gift to Dumbledore. The mead poisons Ron, and Harry is forced to save his life after Slughorn hesitates. Ron murmurs Hermione's name while recovering in the infirmary, causing Lavender to end their relationship. Harry confronts Draco about the mead and a cursed necklace, and the two duel. Harry uses a curse from the Half-Blood Prince's potion book to severely injure Malfoy, who is rescued and healed by Snape. Fearing the book may be filled with more <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dark_Magic" title="Dark Magic">Dark Magic</a>, Ginny and Harry hide it in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Room_of_Requirement" title="Room of Requirement">Room of Requirement</a> and share their first kiss.
</p><p>Harry decides to use his Liquid Luck potion to convince Slughorn to give up the memory Dumbledore needs. Harry views the memory with Dumbledore and learns that Voldemort wanted information for creating <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>, magical objects that could contain pieces of a wizard's soul and make them immortal. Dumbledore concludes that Voldemort successfully divided his soul into seven pieces by creating six Horcruxes, two of which have already been destroyed: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle%27s_diary" title="Tom Riddle's diary">Tom Riddle's diary</a> by Harry and <a href="/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Marvolo_Gaunt's_Ring" title="Magical objects in Harry Potter">Marvolo Gaunt's ring</a> by him.

</p><p>A weakened Dumbledore defends them from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Inferius" title="Inferius">Inferi</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Apparate" title="Apparate">apparates</a> back to Hogwarts. Bellatrix, Greyback, and more Death Eaters enter Hogwarts with Draco's help through the Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement that Draco managed to connect to the one he had been working on in Knockturn Alley. Dumbledore instructs Harry to hide and not interfere under any circumstance. Draco arrives in the Astronomy Tower and disarms Dumbledore revealing that he has been chosen by Voldemort to kill the headmaster. Snape arrives, and casts the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Avada_Kedavra" title="Avada Kedavra">killing curse</a> on Dumbledore when Draco is unable to bring himself to do it, killing the Headmaster. He then overpowers Harry and reveals himself as the Half-Blood Prince before escaping.
</p><p>Harry returns to Hogwarts, where the students, staff, and a few guests mourn Dumbledore's death. He later reveals to Ron and Hermione that the locket Horcrux was a fake. The locket contains a message from "<a href="/wiki/Death_Eater#Regulus_Black" title="Death Eater">R.A.B.</a>", stating that he has stolen the real Horcrux with the intent of destroying it. Rather than returning for their final year at Hogwarts, the three decide to leave and track down the remaining Horcruxes.
</p><p>On the eve of the <a href="/wiki/American_Civil_War" title="American Civil War">American Civil War</a> in 1861, <a href="/wiki/Scarlett_O%27Hara" title="Scarlett O'Hara">Scarlett O'Hara</a> lives at <a href="/wiki/Tara_(plantation)" title="Tara (plantation)">Tara</a>, her family's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cotton_plantation" title="Cotton plantation">cotton plantation</a> in <a href="/wiki/Georgia_(U.S._state)" title="Georgia (U.S. state)">Georgia</a>, with her parents and two sisters and their many slaves. Scarlett learns that <a href="/wiki/Ashley_Wilkes" title="Ashley Wilkes">Ashley Wilkes</a>—whom she secretly loves—is to be <a href="/wiki/Cousin_marriage" title="Cousin marriage">married to his cousin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Melanie_Hamilton" title="Melanie Hamilton">Melanie Hamilton</a>, and the engagement is to be announced the next day at a barbecue at Ashley's home, the nearby plantation <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Oaks" title="Twelve Oaks">Twelve Oaks</a>.
</p><p>At the Twelve Oaks party, Scarlett privately declares her feelings to Ashley, but he rebuffs her by responding that he and Melanie are more compatible. Scarlett is incensed when she discovers another guest, <a href="/wiki/Rhett_Butler" title="Rhett Butler">Rhett Butler</a>, has overheard their conversation. The barbecue is disrupted by the declaration of war and the men rush to enlist. As Scarlett watches Ashley kiss Melanie goodbye, Melanie's younger brother Charles proposes to her. Although she does not love him, Scarlett consents and they are married before he leaves to fight.
</p><p>Scarlett is widowed when Charles dies from a bout of <a href="/wiki/Pneumonia" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Measles" title="Measles">measles</a> while serving in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Confederate_Army" title="Confederate Army">Confederate Army</a>. Scarlett's mother sends her to the Hamilton home in <a href="/wiki/Atlanta" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> to cheer her up, although the O'Haras' outspoken house slave Mammy tells Scarlett she knows she is going there only to wait for Ashley's return. Scarlett, who should not attend a party while in mourning, attends a charity bazaar in Atlanta with Melanie where she meets Rhett again, now a <a href="/wiki/Blockade_runner" title="Blockade runner">blockade runner</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" title="Confederate States of America">Confederacy</a>. Celebrating a Confederate victory and to raise money for the Confederate war effort, gentlemen are invited to bid for ladies to dance with them. Rhett makes an inordinately large bid for Scarlett and, to the disapproval of the guests, she agrees to dance with him.
</p><p>The tide of war turns against the Confederacy after the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg" title="Battle of Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a> in which many of the men of Scarlett's town are killed. Scarlett makes another unsuccessful appeal to Ashley while he is visiting on Christmas <a href="/wiki/Furlough" title="Furlough">furlough</a>, although they do share a private and passionate kiss in the parlor on Christmas Day, just before he returns to war.
</p><p>Eight months later, as the city is besieged by the <a href="/wiki/Union_Army" title="Union Army">Union Army</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Atlanta_Campaign" title="Atlanta Campaign">Atlanta Campaign</a>, Scarlett and her young house slave Prissy must deliver Melanie's baby without medical assistance after she goes into premature labor. Afterwards, Scarlett calls upon Rhett to take her home to Tara with Melanie, her baby, and Prissy; he collects them in a horse and wagon, but once out of the city chooses to go off to fight, leaving Scarlett and the group to make their own way back to Tara. Upon her return home, Scarlett finds Tara deserted, except for her father, her sisters, and two former slaves: Mammy and Pork. Scarlett learns that her mother has just died of <a href="/wiki/Typhoid_fever" title="Typhoid fever">typhoid fever</a> and her father has become incompetent. With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett vows she will do anything for the survival of her family and herself.
</p><p>As the O'Haras work in the cotton fields, Scarlett's father is killed after he is thrown from his horse in an attempt to chase away a <a href="/wiki/Scalawag" title="Scalawag">scalawag</a> from his land. With the defeat of the Confederacy, Ashley also returns, but finds he is of little help at Tara. When Scarlett begs him to run away with her, he confesses his desire for her and kisses her passionately, but says he cannot leave Melanie. Unable to pay the taxes on Tara implemented by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reconstruction_Era" title="Reconstruction Era">Reconstructionists</a>, Scarlett dupes her younger sister Suellen's fiancé, the middle-aged and wealthy mill owner Frank Kennedy, into marrying her, by saying Suellen got tired of waiting and married another suitor.
</p><p>Frank, Ashley, Rhett and several other accomplices make a night raid on a <a href="/wiki/Shanty_town" title="Shanty town">shanty town</a> after Scarlett is attacked while driving through it alone, resulting in Frank's death. With Frank's funeral barely over, Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she accepts. They have a daughter whom Rhett names Bonnie Blue, but Scarlett, still pining for Ashley and chagrined at the perceived ruin of her figure, lets Rhett know that she wants no more children and that they will no longer share a bed.
</p><p>One day at Frank's mill, Scarlett and Ashley are seen embracing by Ashley's sister, India, and harboring an intense dislike of Scarlett she eagerly spreads rumors. Later that evening, Rhett, having heard the rumors, forces Scarlett to attend a birthday party for Ashley. Incapable of believing anything bad of her, Melanie stands by Scarlett's side so that all know that she believes the gossip to be false. After returning home from the party, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk, and they argue about Ashley. Rhett kisses Scarlett against her will, stating his intent to have sex with her that night, and carries the struggling Scarlett to the bedroom. The next day, Rhett apologizes for his behavior and offers Scarlett a divorce, which she rejects, saying that it would be a disgrace. When Rhett returns from an extended trip to London, Scarlett informs him that she is pregnant, but an argument ensues which results in her falling down a flight of stairs and suffering a <a href="/wiki/Miscarriage" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a>. As she is recovering, tragedy strikes when Bonnie dies while attempting to jump a fence with her pony.
</p><p>Scarlett and Rhett visit Melanie, who has suffered complications arising from a new pregnancy, on her deathbed. As Scarlett consoles Ashley, Rhett prepares to leave Atlanta. Having realized that it was he she truly loved all along, and not Ashley, Scarlett pleads with Rhett to stay, but Rhett rebuffs her and walks away into the morning fog, leaving her in tears on the staircase, vowing to one day win back his love.
</p><p>In 2154, humans have depleted <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>'s natural resources, leading to a severe energy crisis. The Resources Development Administration (RDA for short) mines for a valuable mineral — <a href="/wiki/Unobtainium" title="Unobtainium">unobtanium</a> — on Pandora, a densely forested <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Habitable_moon" title="Habitable moon">habitable moon</a> orbiting the <a href="/wiki/Gas_giant" title="Gas giant">gas giant</a> Polyphemus in the <a href="/wiki/Alpha_Centauri" title="Alpha Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a> star system.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Horwitz2009_11-1"><a href="#cite_note-Horwitz2009-11">[11]</a></sup> Pandora, whose atmosphere is poisonous to humans, is inhabited by the <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere#Naʼvi" title="Pandoran biosphere">Na'vi</a>, a species of 10-foot tall (3.0 m), blue-skinned, <a href="/wiki/Wisdom" title="Wisdom">sapient</a> humanoids<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> that live in harmony with nature and worship a <a href="/wiki/Mother_goddess" title="Mother goddess">mother goddess</a> named Eywa.
</p><p>To explore <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere" title="Pandoran biosphere">Pandora's biosphere</a>, scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called "avatars", operated by genetically matched humans; Jake Sully, a paraplegic former <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_Marine" title="United States Marine">Marine</a>, replaces his deceased identical twin brother as an operator of one. Dr. Grace Augustine, head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement but accepts his assignment as a bodyguard. While protecting the avatars of Grace and fellow scientist Dr. Norm Spellman as they collect biological data, Jake's avatar is attacked by a <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere#Fauna" title="Pandoran biosphere">thanator</a> and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Witnessing an auspicious sign, she takes him to her clan, whereupon Neytiri's mother Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Colonel" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's <a href="/wiki/Private_military_company" title="Private military company">private security force</a>, promises Jake that the company will restore his legs if he gathers information about the Na'vi and the clan's gathering place, a giant tree called Hometree,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Script25_36-0"><a href="#cite_note-Script25-36">[36]</a></sup> which stands above the richest deposit of unobtanium in the area. When Grace learns of this, she transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/outpost" title="wikt:outpost">outpost</a>. Over the following three months, Jake grows to sympathize with the natives. After Jake is initiated into the tribe, he and Neytiri choose each other as mates, and soon afterward, Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he attempts to disable a bulldozer that threatens to destroy a sacred Na'vi site. When Quaritch shows a video recording of Jake's attack on the bulldozer to Administrator Parker Selfridge,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Script8and15_37-0"><a href="#cite_note-Script8and15-37">[37]</a></sup> and another in which Jake admits that the Na'vi will never abandon Hometree, Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed.
</p><p>Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biological_neural_network" title="Biological neural network">biological neural network</a> native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate before commencing the attack. While trying to warn the Na'vi, Jake confesses to being a spy, and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Seeing this, Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, frees Jake, Grace, and Norm, and airlifts them to Grace's outpost, but during the escape Quaritch fires at them, hitting Grace.
</p><p>To regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fictional_universe_in_Avatar#The_Tree_of_Souls" title="Fictional universe in Avatar">Tree of Souls</a> and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can be completed. Supported by the new chief Tsu'tey, Jake speaks to unite the clan and tells them to gather all of the clans to battle against the RDA. Noticing the impending gathering, Quaritch organizes a <a href="/wiki/Preemptive_war" title="Preemptive war">pre-emptive strike</a> against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives. On the eve of battle, Jake prays to Eywa, via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na'vi.
</p><p>During the subsequent battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy; but are rescued when <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Characters_and_wildlife_in_Avatar#Fauna" title="Characters and wildlife in Avatar">Pandoran wildlife</a> unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch, wearing an <a href="/wiki/Mecha" title="Mecha">AMP suit</a>, escapes from his own damaged aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation.
</p><p>With the exceptions of Jake, Norm and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora and sent back to Earth, after which Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.

They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[Note 1]</a></sup> Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard <i>Keldysh</i> and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard <i>Titanic</i>.
</p><p>In 1912 <a href="/wiki/Southampton" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>, 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fiancé Cal Hockley, and her mother Ruth board the luxurious <i>Titanic</i>. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve their family's financial problems and retain their high-class persona. Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class.
</p><p>Aware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cal's bodyguard, Mr. Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with an iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.
</p><p>Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Lovejoy slips the necklace into Jack's pocket and he and Cal accuse him of theft. Jack is arrested, taken to the <a href="/wiki/Master-at-arms" title="Master-at-arms">master-at-arms</a>' office, and handcuffed to a pipe. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.
</p><p>With the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.
</p><p>After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for only one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of <a href="/wiki/Hypothermia" title="Hypothermia">hypothermia</a><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Carlson_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Carlson-9">[8]</a></sup> but Rose is saved.
</p><p>With Rose hiding from Cal en route, the <a href="/wiki/RMS_Carpathia" title="RMS Carpathia">RMS <i>Carpathia</i></a> takes the survivors to New York City where Rose gives her name as Rose Dawson.

</p><p>Back in the present, Lovett decides to abandon his search after hearing Rose's story.

Her love of music and the mountains, her youthful enthusiasm and imagination, and her lack of discipline cause some concern among the nuns. The Mother Abbess, believing Maria would be happier outside the abbey, sends her to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children—Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. Liesl, the oldest, is won over after Maria protects her from discovery when she is nearly caught sneaking back into the house after meeting with Rolfe, a messenger boy she is in love with.
</p><p>While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children and takes them around Salzburg and the surrounding mountains, and teaches them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend, Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake that concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities, and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain orders her to return to the abbey. Just then he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness.

When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional <i><a href="/wiki/L%C3%A4ndler" title="Ländler">Ländler</a></i> folk dance, he cuts in and dances with Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy while convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. Back at the abbey, when Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her life. After Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. The Captain's feelings for Maria, however, have not changed, and after breaking off his engagement the Captain marries Maria.
</p><p>While the Captain and Maria are on their honeymoon, Max enters the children in the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. When they learn that Austria has been annexed by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Third_Reich" title="Third Reich">Third Reich</a> in the <i><a href="/wiki/Anschluss" title="Anschluss">Anschluss</a></i>, the couple return to their home, where a telegram awaits informing the Captain that he must report to the German Naval base at <a href="/wiki/Bremerhaven" title="Bremerhaven">Bremerhaven</a> to accept a commission in the <a href="/wiki/Kriegsmarine" title="Kriegsmarine">German Navy</a>. Strongly opposed to the Nazis and the <i>Anschluss</i>, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately for <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. Many of the Von Trapps' friends are prepared to accept the new regime, including Rolfe, whom Liesl is devastated to see has joined the <a href="/wiki/Hitler_Youth" title="Hitler Youth">Hitler Youth</a>. That night, as the von Trapp family attempt to leave, they are stopped by a group of <a href="/wiki/Sturmabteilung" title="Sturmabteilung">Brownshirts</a> waiting outside the villa. When questioned by <i><a href="/wiki/Gauleiter" title="Gauleiter">Gauleiter</a></i> Hans Zeller, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven.
</p><p>Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slip away and seek shelter at the nearby abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Brownshirts soon arrive and search the abbey, and the family is discovered by Rolfe. Upon seeing Liesl, he hesitates raising the alarm long enough to allow the family time to flee, and the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When the soldiers attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start as two nuns have removed parts of the engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom.
</p><p>A group of alien botanists secretly visit <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> under cover of night to gather plant specimens in a California forest. When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, but in their haste, one of them is left behind. In a suburban neighborhood in the <a href="/wiki/San_Fernando_Valley" title="San Fernando Valley">San Fernando Valley</a>, a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves <a href="/wiki/Reese%27s_Pieces" title="Reese's Pieces">Reese's Pieces</a> candy to lure the alien to his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its <a href="/wiki/Planetary_system" title="Planetary system">planetary system</a> and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead <a href="/wiki/Chrysanthemum" title="Chrysanthemum">chrysanthemums</a>.
</p><p>At school the next day, Elliott begins to experience a psychic connection with the alien, including exhibiting signs of intoxication (because it is at his home, drinking beer and watching <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tom_%26_Jerry" title="Tom &amp; Jerry">Tom &amp; Jerry</a></i>), and he begins freeing all the frogs in his biology class. As the alien watches <a href="/wiki/John_Wayne" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a> kiss <a href="/wiki/Maureen_O%27Hara" title="Maureen O'Hara">Maureen O'Hara</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Quiet_Man" title="The Quiet Man">The Quiet Man</a></i> on television, Elliott then kisses a girl he likes in the same manner and he is sent to the principal's office.
</p><p>The alien learns to speak English by repeating what Gertie says as she watches <i><a href="/wiki/Sesame_Street" title="Sesame Street">Sesame Street</a></i> and, at Elliott's urging, dubs itself "E.T." E.T. reads a comic strip where <a href="/wiki/Buck_Rogers" title="Buck Rogers">Buck Rogers</a>, stranded, calls for help by building a makeshift communication device and is inspired to try it himself. E.T. receives Elliott's help in building a device to "phone home" by using a <a href="/wiki/Speak_%26_Spell_(toy)" title="Speak &amp; Spell (toy)">Speak &amp; Spell</a> toy. Michael notices that E.T.'s health is declining and that Elliott is referring to himself as "we".
</p><p>On <a href="/wiki/Halloween" title="Halloween">Halloween</a>, Michael and Elliott dress E.T. as a ghost so they can sneak him out of the house. That night, Elliott and E.T. head through the forest, where they make a successful call home. The next day, Elliott wakes up in the field, only to find E.T. gone. Elliott returns home to his distressed family. Michael searches for and finds E.T. dying next to a culvert. Michael takes E.T. home to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son's illness and the dying alien, just as government agents invade the house. Scientists set up a hospital at the house, questioning Michael, Mary and Gertie while treating Elliott and E.T. Their connection disappears and E.T. then appears to die while Elliott recovers. A grief-stricken Elliott is left alone with the motionless E.T. when he notices a dead chrysanthemum, the plant E.T. had previously revived, coming back to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael's friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bicycles. Suddenly facing a police roadblock, they escape as E.T. uses <a href="/wiki/Psychokinesis" title="Psychokinesis">telekinesis</a> to lift them into the air and toward the forest, like he had done for Elliott before.
</p><p>Standing near the spaceship, E.T.'s heart glows as he prepares to return home. Mary, Gertie, and "Keys", a friendly government agent, show up. E.T. says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, as she presents him with the chrysanthemum that he had revived. Before boarding the spaceship, he embraces Elliott and tells him "I'll be right here", pointing his glowing finger to Elliott's forehead. He then picks up the chrysanthemum, boards the spaceship, and it takes off, leaving a rainbow in the sky as everyone watches it leave.

</p><p>Prince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with <a href="/wiki/Ethiopia" title="Ethiopia">Ethiopia</a> and establishing an alliance. Moses and princess <a href="/wiki/Nefertari" title="Nefertari">Nefertiri</a> fall in love, but she must marry the next Pharaoh. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh <a href="/wiki/Seti_I" title="Seti I">Sethi</a>'s jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter <a href="/wiki/Joshua" title="Joshua">Joshua</a>, who tells him of the <a href="/wiki/Yahweh" title="Yahweh">Hebrew God</a>. Moses saves an elderly woman from being crushed not knowing that she is his biological mother, Yoshebel, and he reprimands the taskmaster and overseer Baka.
</p><p>Moses reforms the treatment of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Slaves" title="Slaves">slaves</a> on the project, but Prince <a href="/wiki/Ramesses_II" title="Ramesses II">Rameses</a>, Moses's adoptive brother, charges him with planning an insurrection. Moses says he is making his workers more productive, making Rameses wonder if Moses is the man the Hebrews are calling the Deliverer.
</p><p>Nefretiri learns from Memnet that Moses is the son of Hebrew slaves. She kills Memnet but reveals the story to Moses only after he finds the piece of <a href="/wiki/Levite" title="Levite">Levite</a> cloth he was wrapped in as a baby, which Memnet had kept. Moses follows Bithiah to Yoshebel's house where he meets his biological mother, Brother Aaron, and Sister Miriam.
</p><p>Moses learns more about the slaves by working with them. Nefretiri urges him to return to the palace so he may help his people when he becomes pharaoh, to which he agrees after he completes a final task. Moses saves Joshua from death by killing Baka, telling Joshua that he too is Hebrew. The confession is witnessed by the overseer <a href="/wiki/Dathan" title="Dathan">Dathan</a>, who then reports to Rameses. After being arrested, Moses explains that he is not the Deliverer, but would free the slaves if he could. Sethi banishes Moses to the desert leaving Rameses as the sole heir. Yoshebel dies sometime later.

While farming, Moses sees the <a href="/wiki/Burning_bush" title="Burning bush">burning bush</a> on the summit of <a href="/wiki/Mount_Sinai" title="Mount Sinai">Mount Sinai</a> and hears the voice of God. Moses returns to Egypt to free the Hebrews.
</p><p>Moses comes before Rameses, now pharaoh, to win the slaves' freedom, turning his staff into a <a href="/wiki/Cobra" title="Cobra">cobra</a>. <a href="/wiki/Jannes_and_Jambres" title="Jannes and Jambres">Jannes</a> performs the same trick with his staves, but Moses's snake swallows his. Rameses prohibits straw from being provided to the Hebrews to make their bricks. Nefretiri rescues Moses from being stoned to death by the Hebrews wherein he reveals that he is married.
</p><p>Egypt is visited by plagues. Moses turns the river Nile to blood at a festival of <a href="/wiki/Khnum" title="Khnum">Khnum</a> and brings burning hail down upon Pharaoh's palace. Moses warns him the next plague to fall upon Egypt will be summoned by Pharaoh himself. Enraged at the plagues, Rameses orders all first-born Hebrews to die, but a cloud of death instead kills all the firstborn of Egypt, including the child of Rameses and Nefretiri. Angrily, Pharaoh exiles the Hebrews, which begins <a href="/wiki/The_Exodus" title="The Exodus">the Exodus</a> from Egypt.
</p><p>Rameses takes his army and pursues the Hebrews to the <a href="/wiki/Red_Sea" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a>.

</p><p>Moses again ascends the mountain with Joshua. Impatiently, Dathan urges a reluctant Aaron to construct a <a href="/wiki/Golden_calf" title="Golden calf">golden calf</a> idol as a gift for Rameses. A wild and decadent orgy is held by most of the Hebrews.

</p><p>The film takes place mostly against a backdrop of the pre-<a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> years, World War I itself, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1917" title="Russian Revolution of 1917">Russian Revolution</a> of 1917, and the <a href="/wiki/Russian_Civil_War" title="Russian Civil War">Russian Civil War</a>. A narrative <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Framing_device" title="Framing device">framing device</a>, set in the late 1940s or early 1950s, involves <a href="/wiki/KGB" title="KGB">KGB</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lieutenant_General" title="Lieutenant General">Lieutenant General</a> Yevgraf Andreyevich Zhivago (<a href="/wiki/Alec_Guinness" title="Alec Guinness">Alec Guinness</a>) searching for the daughter of his half brother, Doctor Yuri Andreyevich Zhivago (<a href="/wiki/Omar_Sharif" title="Omar Sharif">Omar Sharif</a>), and Larissa ("Lara") (<a href="/wiki/Julie_Christie" title="Julie Christie">Julie Christie</a>). Yevgraf believes a young woman, Tanya Komarova (<a href="/wiki/Rita_Tushingham" title="Rita Tushingham">Rita Tushingham</a>), may be his niece and tells her the story of her father's life.
</p><p>After the burial of his mother in rural Russia, the orphaned Yuri Zhivago is taken in by his mother's friends in <a href="/wiki/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>: Alexander (<a href="/wiki/Ralph_Richardson" title="Ralph Richardson">Ralph Richardson</a>) and Anna Gromeko (<a href="/wiki/Siobh%C3%A1n_McKenna" title="Siobhán McKenna">Siobhán McKenna</a>), and their daughter Tonya (<a href="/wiki/Geraldine_Chaplin" title="Geraldine Chaplin">Geraldine Chaplin</a>).
</p><p>In 1913, Zhivago, as a medical student in training, but a poet at heart, meets Tonya as she returns to Moscow after a long trip to Paris. Lara, only 17, is involved in an affair with the older and well-connected Victor Ippolitovich Komarovsky (<a href="/wiki/Rod_Steiger" title="Rod Steiger">Rod Steiger</a>), a friend of her mother's (<a href="/wiki/Adrienne_Corri" title="Adrienne Corri">Adrienne Corri</a>). One night, the idealistic reformer Pavel Pavlovich ("Pasha") Antipov (<a href="/wiki/Tom_Courtenay" title="Tom Courtenay">Tom Courtenay</a>) drifts into left-wing extremism after being wounded by sabre-wielding <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dragoons" title="Dragoons">dragoons</a> during a peaceful demonstration. Pasha runs to Lara, whom he wants to marry, to treat his wound. He asks her to hide a gun he picked up at the demonstration.
</p><p>Lara's mother discovers her affair with Komarovsky and attempts suicide. Komarovsky summons help from his physician (<a href="/wiki/Geoffrey_Keen" title="Geoffrey Keen">Geoffrey Keen</a>), Zhivago's former professor, whom he accompanies back to Lara's home to treat her mother. When Komarovsky learns of Lara's intentions to marry Pasha, he tries to dissuade Lara, and then rapes her. In revenge, the humiliated Lara takes the pistol she has been hiding for Pasha and shoots Komarovsky at a Christmas Eve party, wounding him. Komarovsky insists no action be taken against Lara, who is escorted out by Pasha. Zhivago tends Komarovsky's wound. Although enraged and devastated by Lara's affair with Komarovsky, Pasha marries Lara, and they have a daughter named Katya.
</p><p>During <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, Yevgraf Zhivago is sent by the <a href="/wiki/Bolsheviks" title="Bolsheviks">Bolsheviks</a> to subvert the <a href="/wiki/Imperial_Russian_Army" title="Imperial Russian Army">Imperial Russian Army</a>. Pasha is reported <a href="/wiki/Missing_in_action" title="Missing in action">missing in action</a> following a daring charge attack on <a href="/wiki/German_Empire" title="German Empire">German forces</a>. Lara enlists as a nurse to search for him. Yuri Zhivago is drafted and becomes a battlefield doctor.
</p><p>During the <a href="/wiki/February_Revolution" title="February Revolution">February Revolution</a> in 1917, Zhivago enlists Lara's help to tend to the wounded. Together they run a field hospital for six months, during which time radical changes ensue throughout Russia as <a href="/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin" title="Vladimir Lenin">Vladimir Lenin</a> arrives in Moscow. Before their departure, Yuri and Lara fall in love, but Yuri remains true to Tonya, who became his wife.
</p><p>After the war, Yuri returns to his wife Tonya, son Sasha, and Alexander (Anna has since died), whose house in Moscow has been divided into <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tenements" title="Tenements">tenements</a> by the new Soviet government. Yevgraf, now a member of the <a href="/wiki/Cheka" title="Cheka">Cheka</a>, informs him his poems have been condemned by Soviet censors as antagonistic to <a href="/wiki/Communism" title="Communism">Communism</a>. Yevgraf arranges for passes and documents in order for Yuri and his family to escape from the new political capital of Moscow to the far-away Gromeko estate at Varykino, in the <a href="/wiki/Ural_Mountains" title="Ural Mountains">Ural Mountains</a>. Zhivago, Tonya, Sasha, and Alexander board a heavily guarded cattle train, at which time they are informed that they will be travelling through contested territory, which is being secured by the infamous Bolshevik commander named Strelnikov, who is, in fact, Pasha Antipov.
</p><p>While the train is stopped early one morning, Zhivago wanders away. He stumbles across the <a href="/wiki/Armoured_train" title="Armoured train">armoured train</a> of Strelnikov sitting on a hidden siding. Yuri is summoned before Strelnikov, whom he recognizes as the former Pasha Antipov. During a tense interview, Strelnikov informs Yuri that his estranged wife Lara is now living in the town of Yuriatin, then occupied by the anti-Communist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/White_Army" title="White Army">White Army</a> forces. He permits Zhivago to return to his family, although it is hinted by Strelnikov's right-hand man that most people interrogated by Strelnikov end up being shot.
</p><p>The family lives a peaceful life in a cottage at the Varykino estate until Zhivago finds Lara in nearby Yuriatin, at which point they surrender to their long-repressed feelings. When Tonya becomes pregnant, Yuri breaks off with Lara, only to be abducted and conscripted into service by Communist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Partisans_(military)" title="Partisans (military)">partisans</a>.
</p><p>After two years, Zhivago at last deserts and trudges through the deep snow to Yuriatin where he finds Lara. Lara tells Yuri that Tonya had discovered her while searching for him, and that his family is now in Moscow. She reveals a sealed letter Tonya had mailed to Lara 6 months ago to give to Yuri: Tonya, her father, and their children are being deported and will live in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>. Yuri and Lara renew their relationship.
</p><p>One night, Komarovsky arrives and informs them they are being watched by the Cheka due to Lara's connection by marriage to Strelnikov and Yuri's "counter-revolutionary" poetry and desertion. Komarovsky offers Yuri and Lara his help in leaving Russia. They refuse. Instead, they return to the abandoned Varykino estate, taking up residence in the banned main house, where Yuri begins writing the "Lara" poems. These will later make him famous but also incur government displeasure. Komarovsky reappears and tells Yuri that Strelnikov was captured only five miles away while apparently returning to Lara, but then committed suicide en route to his own execution. Therefore, Lara is in immediate danger of execution herself, as the Cheka had only left her free to lure Strelnikov out of hiding. Zhivago sends Lara and Katya away with Komarovsky, who has been appointed a government official in the nominally independent <a href="/wiki/Far_Eastern_Republic" title="Far Eastern Republic">Far Eastern Republic</a> of the early 1920s. Refusing to accompany a man he despises, Yuri remains behind to face his fate.
</p><p>Years later, Yevgraf finds a sick and destitute Yuri in Moscow during the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stalinist_era" title="Stalinist era">Stalinist era</a> and gives him a new suit and a job. While riding a tram, Yuri spots a woman he surely thinks is Lara walking on a nearby street. Unable to call her from the tram, Yuri struggles to get off at the next stop. Yuri runs after her but suffers a fatal heart attack before he can even signal to her, and the woman walks away oblivious to Yuri's presence. Yuri's funeral is well attended, a surprise to Yevgraf as Yuri's poetry was officially "unobtainable at the time". Lara approaches Yevgraf at the funeral and reveals she had given birth to Yuri's daughter, but lost her in the collapse of the <a href="/wiki/Occupation_of_Mongolia" title="Occupation of Mongolia">White-controlled government in Mongolia</a>. After vainly looking over hundreds of orphans with Yevgraf's help, Lara disappears during <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Stalin" title="Joseph Stalin">Joseph Stalin</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Great_Purge" title="Great Purge">Great Purge</a> of the late 1930s, and "died or vanished somewhere ... in one of the <a href="/wiki/Gulag" title="Gulag">labour camps</a>", according to Yevgraf.
</p><p>While Yevgraf strongly feels that Tanya Komarova is Yuri and Lara's daughter, he is still not convinced. But as Tanya leaves, Yevgraf notices that she carries a <a href="/wiki/Balalaika" title="Balalaika">balalaika</a>, an instrument that Yuri's mother was especially gifted at playing. Questioning her further, he learns that Tanya is self-taught — in fact, her fiancé proclaims her an 'artist' with the balalaika. Yevgraf smiles, "Ah. Then it's a gift", thereby implying she truly must be Yuri and Lara's daughter after all.
</p><p>During a beach party at dusk on Amity Island, <a href="/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a>, a young woman, Chrissie Watkins, goes <a href="/wiki/Nude_swimming" title="Nude swimming">skinny dipping</a> in the ocean. While <a href="/wiki/Treading_water" title="Treading water">treading water</a>, she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner's ruling that the death was due to a <a href="/wiki/Shark_attack" title="Shark attack">shark attack</a> leads police chief Martin Brody to close the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly thereafter. A bounty is placed on the shark, prompting an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, and confirms her death was caused by a shark—an unusually large one.
</p><p>When local fishermen catch a <a href="/wiki/Tiger_shark" title="Tiger shark">tiger shark</a>, the mayor proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes that it is the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable <a href="/wiki/Great_white_shark" title="Great white shark">great white shark</a>'s tooth embedded in the submerged hull. He drops it in fright after encountering a partial corpse. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's statements that a huge great white shark is responsible for the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank in which the presence of a shark is simulated, the real shark enters a nearby <a href="/wiki/Estuary" title="Estuary">estuary</a>, killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces Vaughn to hire Quint.
</p><p>Quint, Brody, and Hooper set out on Quint's boat, the <i>Orca</i>, to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a <a href="/wiki/Chumming" title="Chumming">chum</a> line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating its length at 25 feet (7.6 m) and weight at 3 tonnes (3.0 long tons; 3.3 short tons), harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.
</p><p>At nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars and Quint reveals that he survived the <a href="/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)" title="USS Indianapolis (CA-35)">USS <i>Indianapolis</i></a>. The shark returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull, and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he intentionally pushes the damaged engine past the safety limits and the overtaxed engine fails.
</p><p>With the <i>Orca</i> slowly sinking, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on <a href="/wiki/Scuba_set" title="Scuba set">scuba gear</a> and enters the water in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shark-proof_cage" title="Shark-proof cage">shark-proof cage</a>, intending to lethally inject the shark with <a href="/wiki/Strychnine" title="Strychnine">strychnine</a>, using a hypodermic spear. The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly and devours Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody jams a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion obliterates the shark. Hooper surfaces, and he and Brody paddle back to Amity Island clinging to the remaining barrels.

He confronts Flora and tells her that he desires to get married. Frightened, she flees into the forest, pursued by Gus. Trapped on a precipice, Flora warns Gus she will jump if he comes any closer. When he does, she leaps to her death. Having run through the forest looking for her, Ben has seen her jump; he holds her as she dies, then carries her body back to the Cameron home. In response, the Klan hunts down Gus, tries him, finds him guilty, and <a href="/wiki/Lynching" title="Lynching">lynches</a> him.

</p><p><i>Because the film has been lost, the following summary is reconstructed from a description in a contemporary film magazine.</i>
</p><p>Cleopatra (Bara), the Siren of Egypt, by a clever ruse reaches Caesar (Leiber) and he falls victim to her charms. They plan to rule the world together, but then Caesar falls. Cleopatra's life is desired by the church, as the wanton woman's rule has become intolerable. Pharon (Roscoe), a high priest, is given a sacred dagger to take her life. He gives her his love instead and, when she is in need of some money, leads her to the tomb of his ancestors, where she tears the treasure from the breast of the <a href="/wiki/Mummy" title="Mummy">mummy</a>. With this wealth she goes to Rome to meet Antony (Hall). He leaves the affairs of state and travels to Alexandria with her, where they revel. Antony is recalled to Rome and married to Octavia (Blinn), but his soul cries out for Cleopatra. He sends her a message to arm her ships and meet him at Actium, where they <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Actium" title="Battle of Actium">battle</a> the opposing forces. They are overpowered, and flee to Alexandria. There they are captured by Octavius (De Vries), and Antony dies in Cleopatra's arms. Before Cleopatra is to be dragged behind the wheels of Octavius' chariot, Pharon the priest, who has never ceased to love her, brings her the serpent that she joyously brings to her breast, dying royally with her crown on her head and scepter in her hand as becomes Egypt.
</p><p>Mickey (Normand) is an adult orphan who has been raised since girlhood in poverty near Feather River, California by an unsuccessful miner, Joe Meadows, and his housekeeper, Minnie. Mickey is the free-spirited, uncultured daughter of the miner's deceased partner.  Meadows took charge of Mickey at his dying partner's request.  Mickey is sent to live in Great Neck, Long Island—part of suburban <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>—with her aunt (Mrs. Geoffrey Drake) and her family. Mrs. Drake is under the impression that Mickey is wealthy and well refined.  When Mickey arrives at her aunt's luxurious home, the aunt is disappointed that she is not well-to-do and puts her to work as a servant.  Mickey's presence there sparks an awkward love triangle involving her, her cousin (Elsie Drake), and young mining executive Herbert Thornhill (Wheeler Oakman) whom Mickey first encountered in California.  Just after Mickey is sent packing, a telegram arrives for her announcing that a vein has been struck on Joe's Tomboy mine and she is suddenly worth millions.  Mrs. Drake's opinion of Mickey changes quickly and she is welcomed back—in the hope she and Mrs Drake's feckless son, Reggie, will become a couple.  Herbert had recently proposed to Elsie, but realizes he truly loves Mickey.  Shortly afterward, Herbert receives a telegram from his lawyer, Tom Rawlings, explaining that his mining claims are now invalid and thus worthless.  Elsie and Mrs. Drake find the telegram and call off the wedding because Herbert is now bankrupt.  Herbert tries to regain his fortune by borrowing $5,000 and betting it on a horse race.  The race is rigged—and Mickey finds out about the plot.  Just as the race is about to begin, Mickey dresses in jockey silks, unhorses the crooked jockey, and tries to win the race by riding it for Herbert.  Just as it appears Mickey's horse will win, she falls from her mount.  Some time later Mickey reluctantly goes horseback riding with Reggie who tries to molest her in an abandoned house. Herbert arrives on the scene, battles Reggie, and rescues Mickey as she is dangling dangerously from the rooftop.  Mickey and Herbert are married.  As they depart on their honeymoon, a note arrives from lawyer Rawlings explaining the earlier telegram about his mining interests being worthless was a ruse designed to get Herbert out of his loveless engagement to Elsie Drake.  The film ends with both Mickey and Herbert happily in love, wed, and exceedingly wealthy.
</p><p>The film takes place in a small, <a href="/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a> town in 1919 (the Broadway play 1914), where a group of con men plan to use a faith healer to collect money.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Chinatown,_Manhattan" title="Chinatown, Manhattan">Chinatown</a>, four crooks conspire to swindle a small New England town. The gang consists of Tom Burke (Thomas Meighan), the head of the group; Rose (Betty Compson), a con artist posing as a street walker; "The Dope" (J.M. Dumont), who pretends to pimp Rose; and The Frog (Lon Chaney), a contortionist.
</p><p>The plan is clear: in a small town outside of Boston there is a Patriarch (Joseph Dowling) who has been healing people. The group heads to the town and plans to use the Patriarch in a faith healing scheme. When the townspeople gather to see the Patriarch heal the sick, the Frog is there, posing as a cripple. As he crawls to the path of the man, his limbs become straightened and soon he walks to the Patriarch, supposedly healed. Unexpectedly, a crippled boy, his faith in the Patriarch overpowering him, loses his crutches and runs to the Patriarch.
</p><p>The story spreads across the country (mostly on account of Burke), and people flock in from all over to visit the Patriarch and be healed. When a millionaire, Richard King (W. Lawson Butt), brings his sister to be healed, he gives Burke $50,000 after the Patriarch cures her. During this visit, King meets Rose, and the two fall in love.
</p><p>Meanwhile, all is not well with Burke. One by one, he sees his gang disbanding because, unbeknownst to him, the healing power of the Patriarch is at work. The Dope gives up his drug addiction, The Frog gives up his life of crime and takes care of a widow left all alone, and Rose laments King's departure.
</p><p>Burke becomes jealous, but when King returns to propose marriage to Rose, she realizes that she loves Burke.  The Patriarch dies, and the two lovers begin anew.

David (<a href="/wiki/Richard_Barthelmess" title="Richard Barthelmess">Richard Barthelmess</a>), Squire Bartlett's son, falls for her, but she rejects him due to her past.  Then Lennox shows up lusting for another local girl, Kate. Seeing Anna, he tries to get her to leave, but she refuses to go, although she promises to say nothing about his past.
</p><p>Finally, Squire Bartlett learns of Anna's past from Martha, the town gossip.  In his anger, he tosses Anna out into a snow storm.  Before she goes, she fingers the respected Lennox as her despoiler and the father of her dead baby.  Anna becomes lost in the raging storm while David leads a search party.  In the famous climax, the unconscious Anna floats on an ice floe down a river towards a waterfall, until rescued at the last moment by David, who marries her in the final scene.

He is particularly fond of his grandson Julio (<a href="/wiki/Rudolph_Valentino" title="Rudolph Valentino">Rudolph Valentino</a>), with whom he often carouses at seedy dives in the Boca district of Buenos Aires. In one of these bars, the movie's famous <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tango_(dance)" title="Tango (dance)">tango</a> sequence occurs. A man and a woman (Beatrice Dominguez) are dancing the tango. Julio strides up and asks to cut in. The woman stares at Julio alluringly. The man brushes him off, and they resume dancing. Julio then challenges the man and strikes him, knocking him into some tables and out of the scene. Julio and the woman then dance a dramatic version of the tango that brings cheers from the people in the establishment. Following the dance, the woman sits on Julio's lap. Madariaga then slides to the floor, drunk. The woman laughs at Madariaga. Julio casts her aside in scorn and helps his grandfather home.

</p><p>All three men are attracted to Melisande (<a href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9e_Ador%C3%A9e" title="Renée Adorée">Renée Adorée</a>), whose mother owns the farm. She repulses all their advances, but gradually warms to Jim, bonding at first over <a href="/wiki/Chewing_gum" title="Chewing gum">chewing gum</a>. They eventually fall in love, despite not being able to speak <a href="/wiki/French_language" title="French language">each other's language</a>. One day, however, Jim receives a letter and a photograph from Justyn (<a href="/wiki/Claire_Adams" title="Claire Adams">Claire Adams</a>), which reveals that they are engaged. When Melisande sees the picture, she realizes the situation and runs off in tears. Before Jim can decide what to do, his unit is ordered to the front. Melisande hears the commotion and races back, just in time for the lovers to embrace and kiss.
</p><p>The Americans march towards the front and are <a href="/wiki/Strafing" title="Strafing">strafed</a> by an <a href="/wiki/Attack_aircraft#World_War_I_and_II" title="Attack aircraft">enemy fighter</a> before it is <a href="/wiki/Anti-aircraft_warfare#First_World_War" title="Anti-aircraft warfare">shot down</a>. The unit is sent to the attack immediately, advancing against snipers and machine guns in the woods, then more machine guns, artillery, and poison gas in the open. They settle down in a makeshift line. Jim shelters in a shellhole with Slim and Bull.
</p><p>That night, orders come down for one man to go out and eliminate a troublesome mortar crew; Slim wins a spitting contest for the opportunity. He succeeds, but is spotted and wounded on the way back. After listening to Slim's pleas for help, Jim cannot stand it any longer and goes to his rescue against orders. Bull follows, but is shot and killed. By the time Jim reaches Slim, he is already dead. Jim is then shot in the leg. When a German (<a href="/wiki/George_Beranger" title="George Beranger">George Beranger</a>) comes to finish him off, Jim shoots and wounds him. The German starts crawling back to his line. Jim catches up to him in another shellhole, but, face to face, cannot bring himself to finish him off with his bayonet. Instead, he gives his erstwhile enemy a cigarette. Soon after, the German dies. However, Jim is not stuck in <a href="/wiki/No_man%27s_land" title="No man's land">no man's land</a> for long; the Americans attack, and he is taken away to a hospital.
</p><p>From another patient, he learns that Champillon has changed hands four times. Worried about Melisande, Jim sneaks out of the hospital and hitches a ride. When he gets to the farmhouse, he finds it damaged and empty. Melisande and her mother have joined a stream of refugees. Jim collapses and is carried off in an ambulance by retreating soldiers.
</p><p>After the war ends, Jim goes home to America. Before he arrives, his mother overhears Justyn and Jim's brother Harry (Robert Ober) discussing what to do; in Jim's absence, they have fallen in love. When Jim appears, it is revealed that he has had his leg amputated. Later, Jim tells his mother about Melisande; she tells him to go back and find her. When he returns to the farm, Melisande rushes into his arms.

Brother Paul, who was talking to another person about his dream to build a mission, assumes he wants to pay for the mission and tells him $1000. Though he finds that a rather hefty amount for a mere pushcart, Manners pays without complaint.
</p><p>Once Manners reads in the newspaper that he is sponsoring a mission, he goes there to dissociate himself from it. He is aghast to find it named the J. Harold Manners Mission. When he starts to tear down the sign, he is scolded by Brother Paul's pretty daughter, Hope (<a href="/wiki/Jobyna_Ralston" title="Jobyna Ralston">Jobyna Ralston</a>), who does not know who he is. Far from being offended, he is smitten with her. Thus, when Brother Paul returns and invites him inside to tour the place, he readily accepts. Hope, once she learns his identity, apologizes.
</p><p>In order to build up attendance, Manners runs through town provoking people, and winds up with a crowd chasing him right into the mission. Some of the men are in possession of the proceeds of a jewel robbery. Before they can beat him up, however, the police arrive. The quick-witted Manners takes up a "collection"; the crooks deposit their loot in the hat he is using while the police search everybody. This act earns him the friendship of the gang.

As they drive away, one of them tells the wedding's "reception committee" that Manners is not going to marry Hope. The disappointed committeemen get drunk. Then their leader decides to go to Manner's club to confirm the news. They free Manners and head back to the mission. Manners has his hands full shepherding five drunks, but finally gets them all there and marries Hope.

</p><p>Eddie Kearns (<a href="/wiki/Charles_King_(musical_actor)" title="Charles King (musical actor)">Charles King</a>) sings "The Broadway Melody", and tells some chorus girls that he brought the Mahoney Sisters <a href="/wiki/Vaudeville" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</a> act to New York to perform it with him in the latest revue being produced by Francis Zanfield (<a href="/wiki/Eddie_Kane" title="Eddie Kane">Eddie Kane</a>). Harriet "Hank" Mahoney (<a href="/wiki/Bessie_Love" title="Bessie Love">Bessie Love</a>) and her sister Queenie Mahoney (<a href="/wiki/Anita_Page" title="Anita Page">Anita Page</a>) are awaiting Eddie's arrival at their apartment. Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent, while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to become a star. Hank declines the offer of their Uncle Jed (<a href="/wiki/Jed_Prouty" title="Jed Prouty">Jed Prouty</a>) to join a 30-week traveling show but consents to think it over.
</p><p>Eddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to a rehearsal for Zanfield's revue to present their act. A blond woman sabotages their performance by placing a bag in the piano, which causes a fight with Hank. Zanfield isn't interested in it, but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well, saying both will work for one wage. She also convinces him to pretend that Hank's business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During a dress rehearsal for the revue, Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for "The Broadway Melody" and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number. Meanwhile, another woman is injured after falling off a set prop and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is captivated by Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques "Jock" Warriner (<a href="/wiki/Kenneth_Thomson_(actor)" title="Kenneth Thomson (actor)">Kenneth Thomson</a>). While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent.
</p><p>Over the following weeks, Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and the deterioration of the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight her growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she's setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other, but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister's heart, runs off to Jock once again.
</p><p>Hank, after witnessing Queenie's fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, finally realizes that they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. She claims to never have loved him and that she'd only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves, she breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show.
</p><p>There's a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie, but he insists that they spend time alone. When she resists his advances, he says that it's the least that she could do after all he's done for her. He begins to get physical, but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind.
</p><p>Sometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the return of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend, but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she's through with show business and will settle down in their new house on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Long_Island,_New_York" title="Long Island, New York">Long Island</a>. She insists that Hank live with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments the fact that she wasn't able to help her sister find the happiness she deserves. Ironically, Hank's new partner is the blond who tried to sabotage the act when the sisters first arrived in New York. The final scene shows Hank on her way to the train station. She promises her new partner that they'll be back on Broadway within six months.

</p><p>Professor Kantorek gives an impassioned speech about the glory of serving in the <a href="/wiki/German_Army_(German_Empire)" title="German Army (German Empire)">Army</a> and "saving the Fatherland". On the brink of becoming men, the boys in his class, led by Paul Baumer, are moved to join the army as the new 2nd Company.  Their romantic delusions are quickly broken during their brief but rigorous training under the abusive Corporal Himmelstoss, who bluntly informs them, "You're going to be soldiers—and that's <i>all</i>."
</p><p>The new soldiers arrive by train at the combat zone, which is mayhem, with soldiers everywhere, incoming shells, horse-drawn wagons racing about, and prolonged rain. One in the group is killed before the new recruits can reach their post, to the alarm of one of the new soldiers (Behn). The new soldiers are assigned to a unit composed of older soldiers, who are not exactly accommodating. The young soldiers find that there is no food available at the moment. They have not eaten since breakfast, but the men they have joined have not had food for two days. One of them, "Kat" Katczinsky, had gone to locate something to eat and he returns with a slaughtered hog he has stolen from a field kitchen. The young soldiers "pay" for their dinner with soaps and cigarettes.
</p><p>The new recruits' first trip to the trenches with the veterans, to re-string barbed wire, is a harrowing experience, especially when Behn is blinded by shrapnel and hysterically runs into machine-gun fire. After spending several days in a bunker under bombardment, they at last move into the trenches and successfully repulse an enemy attack; they then counterattack and take an enemy trench with heavy casualties, but have to abandon it. They are sent back to the field kitchens to get their rations; each man receives double helpings, simply because of the number of dead.
</p><p>The men start out eating greedily, but then settle into a satiated <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/torpor" title="wikt:torpor">torpor</a>. They hear that they are to return to the front the next day and begin a semi-serious discussion about the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Origins_of_World_War_I" title="Origins of World War I">causes of the war</a> and of wars in general. They speculate about whether geographical entities offend each other and whether these disagreements involve them. Tjaden speaks familiarly about himself and the <a href="/wiki/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor" title="Wilhelm II, German Emperor">Kaiser</a>; Kat jokes that instead of having a war, they should have the leaders of Europe be stripped to their underwear and "fight it out with clubs".
</p><p>One day, Corporal Himmelstoss arrives to the front and is immediately spurned because of his bad reputation; he is forced to go over the top with the 2nd Company and is promptly killed. In an attack on a cemetery, Paul stabs a French soldier, but finds himself trapped in a hole with the dying man for an entire night. Throughout the night, he desperately tries to help him, bringing him water, but fails miserably to stop him from dying. He cries bitterly and begs the dead body to speak so he can be forgiven. Later, he returns to the German lines and is comforted by Kat.
</p><p>Going back to the front line, Paul is severely wounded and taken to a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Catholic" title="Catholic">Catholic</a> hospital, along with his good friend Albert Kropp. Kropp's leg is amputated, but he does not find out until some time afterwards. Around this time, Paul is taken to the bandaging ward, from which, according to its reputation, nobody has ever returned alive; but he later returns to the normal rooms triumphantly, only to find Kropp in depression.
</p><p>Paul is given a furlough and visits his family at home.  He is shocked by how uninformed everyone is about the actual situation of the war; everyone is convinced that a final "push for Paris" is soon to occur.  When Paul visits the schoolroom where he was originally recruited, he finds Professor Kantorek prattling the same patriotic fervor to a class of even younger students.  Professor Kantorek asks of Paul to detail his experience, to which the latter reveals that war was not at all like he had envisioned and mentions the deaths of his partners; this revelation upsets the professor, as well as the young students who promptly call Paul a "coward". Disillusioned and angry, Paul returns to the front and comes upon another 2nd company that is filled with new young recruits who are now disillusioned; he is then happily greeted by Tjaden.  He goes to find Kat, and they discuss the inability of the people to comprehend the futility of the war.  Kat's shin is broken when a bomb dropped by an aircraft falls nearby, so Paul carries him back to a field hospital - only to find that Kat has been killed by a second explosion.  Crushed by the loss of his mentor, Paul leaves.
</p><p>In the final scene, Paul is back on the front lines. He sees a butterfly just beyond his trench. Paul smiles and reaches out towards the butterfly, but becoming too exposed, he is shot and killed by an enemy sniper.  The final shot shows the 2nd Company arriving at the front for the first time, fading out to the image of a cemetery.
</p><p><i>Frankenstein</i> begins with <a href="/wiki/Edward_Van_Sloan" title="Edward Van Sloan">Edward Van Sloan</a> stepping from behind a curtain and delivering a brief caution before the opening credits:
</p><p>In a village of the Bavarian Alps, a young scientist, named Henry Frankenstein, and his assistant <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fritz_(Frankenstein)" title="Fritz (Frankenstein)">Fritz</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Kyphosis" title="Kyphosis">hunchback</a>, piece together a human body, the parts of which have been collected from various sources, including stolen freshly buried bodies in a cemetery, and the bodies of recently-hanged criminals. Frankenstein desires to create human life through electrical devices which he has perfected. He sends Fritz to a school where <a href="/wiki/Doctor_Waldman" title="Doctor Waldman">Dr. Waldman</a>, Henry's old medical professor, teaches, to steal a brain; Fritz drops the normal brain and has to take the brain of a criminal.
</p><p>Elizabeth, his fiancée, is worried over his peculiar actions. She cannot understand why he secludes himself in an abandoned watch tower, which he has equipped as a laboratory, and refuses to see anyone. She and a friend, Victor Moritz, go to Dr. Waldman, and ask Waldman's help in reclaiming the young scientist from his experiments. Waldman tells them that Frankenstein has been working on creating life. Elizabeth, intent on rescuing Frankenstein, arrives just as Henry is making his final tests. He tells them to watch, claiming to have discovered the ray that brought life into the world. They watch Frankenstein and the hunchback as they raise the dead creature on an operating table, high into the room, toward an opening at the top of the laboratory. Then a terrific crash of thunder booms, and Frankenstein's electric machines flash, crackle and buzz. Shortly, the hand of Frankenstein's creature begins to move. This prompts Frankenstein to shout 'It's alive!'.
</p><p>The manufactured creature, despite its grotesque form, initially appears to be a simple, innocent creation. Frankenstein welcomes it into his laboratory and asks his creation to sit, which it does. He then opens up the roof, causing the creature to reach out towards the sunlight. Fritz enters with a flaming torch, which frightens the creature. Its fright is mistaken by Frankenstein and Waldman as an attempt to attack them, and it is chained in the dungeon. Thinking that it is not fit for society and will wreak havoc at any chance, they leave the creature locked up, where Fritz antagonizes it with a torch. As Henry and Waldman consider the creature's fate, they hear a shriek from the dungeon. Frankenstein and Waldman run down and find that the creature has strangled Fritz. The creature lunges at the two but they escape, locking the creature inside. Realizing that the creature must be destroyed, Henry prepares an injection of a powerful drug and the two conspire to release the creature and inject it as it attacks. When the door is unlocked the creature lunges at Frankenstein as Waldman injects the drug into the creature's back. The creature falls to the floor unconscious.
</p><p>Henry collapses from exhaustion, and Elizabeth and Henry's father arrive and take him home. Henry is worried about the creature but Waldman reassures him that he will destroy it. Later, Henry is at home, recovered and preparing for his wedding while Waldman examines the creature. As he is preparing to vivisect it, the creature awakens and strangles him. It escapes from the tower and wanders through the landscape. It has a short encounter with a farmer's young daughter, Maria. She is not afraid of him and asks him to play a game with her in which they toss flowers into a lake and watch them float. The creature enjoys the game, but when they run out of flowers he thinks Maria will float as well, so he throws her into the lake where, to his puzzlement, she drowns. Upset by this outcome, the creature runs away.
</p><p>With preparations for the wedding completed, Henry is serenely happy with Elizabeth. They are to marry as soon as Waldman arrives. However, Victor rushes in, saying that Doctor Waldman has been found strangled. Henry suspects the creature. Meanwhile, the creature enters Elizabeth's room, causing her to scream. When the searchers arrive, they find Elizabeth unconscious on the bed. The creature has escaped.
</p><p>Maria's father arrives, carrying his daughter's body. He says she was murdered, and the villagers form a search party to capture the creature, and bring it to justice (dead or alive). In order to search the whole country for the creature, they split into three groups: Ludwig leads the first group into the woods, Henry leads the second group into the mountains, and the Bürgermaster leads the third group by the lake. During the search, Henry becomes separated from the group and is discovered by the creature, who attacks him. The creature knocks Henry unconscious and carries him off to an old mill. The peasants hear his cries and they regroup to follow. They find the creature has climbed to the top, dragging Henry with him. The creature hurls the scientist to the ground. His fall is broken by the vanes of the windmill, saving his life. Some of the villagers hurry him to his home while the rest of the mob set the windmill ablaze, killing the entrapped creature inside.
</p><p>At Castle Frankenstein, Frankenstein's father, Baron Frankenstein, celebrates the wedding of his recovered son with a toast to a future grandchild.
</p><p>Citizens and dignitaries are assembled for the unveiling of a new monument to "Peace and Prosperity". After droning speeches the veil is lifted to reveal the Little Tramp asleep in the lap of one of the sculpted figures. After several minutes of slapstick he manages to escape the assembly's wrath to perambulate the city. He rebukes two newsboys who taunt him for his shabbiness, and while coyly admiring a nude statue has a near-fatal encounter with a sidewalk elevator.
</p><p>The Tramp encounters the beautiful flower girl on a street-corner and in the course of buying a flower realizes she is blind; he is instantly smitten. Through an aural coincidence the girl mistakes her customer for the wealthy owner of a chauffeured automobile.
</p><p>That evening the Tramp saves a drunken millionaire from suicide. The millionaire takes his new best friend back to his mansion for champagne, then (after another abortive suicide attempt) out for a night on the town. After helping the millionaire home the next morning, he sees the flower girl en route to her street-corner. The Tramp gets some money from the millionaire and catches up to the girl; he buys all her flowers and drives her home in the millionaire's car.
</p><p>After the Tramp leaves, the flower girl tells her grandmother (<a href="/wiki/Florence_Lee_(born_1864)" title="Florence Lee (born 1864)">Florence Lee</a>) about her kind and wealthy friend. Meanwhile, the Tramp returns to the mansion, where the millionaire – now sober – does not remember him and has him thrown out. Later that day, the millionaire is once more intoxicated and, seeing the Tramp on the street, invites him home for a lavish party. But the next morning history repeats itself: the millionaire is again sober and the Tramp is again out on his ear.
</p><p>Finding that the girl is not at her usual street-corner, the Tramp goes to her apartment, where he overhears a doctor tell the grandmother that the girl is very ill: "She has a fever and needs careful attention."
Determined to help, the Tramp takes a job as a <a href="/wiki/Street_sweeper" title="Street sweeper">street sweeper</a>.
</p><p>On his lunch break he brings the girl groceries while her grandmother is out selling flowers. To entertain her he reads a newspaper aloud; in it is a story about a Viennese doctor's blindness cure.
"Wonderful, then I'll be able to see you," says the girl – and the Tramp is struck by what may happen should she gain her sight and discover that he is not the wealthy man she imagines.
He also finds an eviction notice the girl's grandmother has hidden. As he leaves, he promises the girl that he will pay the rent.
</p><p>The Tramp returns to work to find himself fired – he has been late once too often.
A boxer convinces him to fight in a fake bout; they will "go easy" on each other and split the prize money. But the boxer flees on learning he is about to be arrested, and is replaced by a no-nonsense fighter who knocks the Tramp out despite the Tramp's creative and nimble efforts to keep out of reach.
</p><p>The Tramp encounters the drunken millionaire a third time and is again invited to the mansion. The Tramp relates the girl's plight and the millionaire gives him money for her operation. Two burglars knock the millionaire out and flee with the rest of his money. The police find the Tramp with the money given him by the millionaire, who because of the knock on the head does not remember giving it. The Tramp evades the police long enough to get the money to the girl, telling her he will be going away for a time, but in due course he is apprehended and imprisoned.
</p><p>Months later the Tramp is released. He goes to the girl's customary street corner but she is not there. We learn that the girl – her sight restored – now runs a busy flower shop with her grandmother. But she has not forgotten her mysterious benefactor, whom she imagines to be rich and handsome: when an elegant man enters the shop she wonders for a moment if "he" has returned.
</p><p>The Tramp happens by the shop, where the girl is arranging flowers in the window. He stoops to retrieve a flower discarded in the gutter. After a brief skirmish with his old nemeses, the newsboys, he turns to the shop's window through which he suddenly sees the girl, who has been watching him without (of course) knowing who he is. At the sight of her he is frozen for a few seconds, then breaks into a broad smile. The girl is flattered and giggles to her employee: "I've made a conquest!" Via pantomime through the glass, she kindly offers him a fresh flower (to replace the crushed one he took from the gutter) as well as a coin.
</p><p>Suddenly embarrassed, the Tramp starts to shuffle away, but the girl steps to the shop door and again offers the flower, which he shyly accepts. She takes his hand and presses the coin into it, but abruptly she stops; her smile turns to a look of puzzlement. She runs her fingers along his arm, his shoulder, his lapels, then catches her breath: "You?" The Tramp nods with an uncertain smile and asks, "You can see now?" The girl replies, "Yes, I can see now" and tearfully pulls his hand to her bosom. The uncertainty on the Tramp's face turns to joy as the film fades to black.
</p><p>The year is 1932. In <a href="/wiki/New_York_Harbor" title="New York Harbor">New York Harbor</a>, filmmaker <a href="/wiki/Carl_Denham" title="Carl Denham">Carl Denham</a>, famous for making wildlife films in remote and exotic locations, charters Captain Englehorn's ship, the <i>Venture</i>, for his new project. However, he is unable to secure an actress for a female role he has been reluctant to disclose. Searching in the streets of <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, he finds Ann Darrow and promises her the adventure of a lifetime. The crew boards the <i>Venture</i> and sets off, during which the ship's first mate <a href="/wiki/Jack_Driscoll" title="Jack Driscoll">Jack Driscoll</a>, falls in love with Ann.
</p><p>Denham reveals to the crew that their destination is in fact <a href="/wiki/Skull_Island" title="Skull Island">Skull Island</a>, an uncharted territory. He alludes to a monstrous creature named <i>Kong</i>, rumored to dwell on the island. The crew arrives and anchor offshore. They encounter a native village, separated from the rest of the island by an ancient stone wall. They witness a group of natives preparing to sacrifice a young woman termed the "bride of Kong". The intruders are spotted and the native chief stops the ceremony. When he sees Ann, he offers to trade six of his tribal women for the "golden woman". They rebuff him and return to the <i>Venture</i>.
</p><p>That night, natives kidnap Ann from the ship and take her to their altar, where she is offered to Kong, an enormous <a href="/wiki/Gorilla" title="Gorilla">gorilla</a>-like creature. Kong carries Ann into the wilderness as Denham, Driscoll and some volunteers enter the jungle in hopes of rescuing her. They are ambushed by another giant creature, a <i><a href="/wiki/Stegosaurus" title="Stegosaurus">Stegosaurus</a></i>, which they manage to defeat. After facing a <i><a href="/wiki/Brontosaurus" title="Brontosaurus">Brontosaurus</a></i> and Kong himself, Driscoll and Denham are the only survivors.
</p><p>A <i><a href="/wiki/Tyrannosaurus" title="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus</a></i> attacks Ann and Kong, but he kills it in the battle. Meanwhile, Driscoll continues to follow them, while Denham returns to the village for more men. Upon arriving in Kong's lair, Ann is menaced by a <a href="/wiki/Snake" title="Snake">snake</a>-like <i><a href="/wiki/Elasmosaurus" title="Elasmosaurus">Elasmosaurus</a></i>, which Kong also kills. While Kong is distracted killing a <i><a href="/wiki/Pteranodon" title="Pteranodon">Pteranodon</a></i> that tried to fly away with Ann, Driscoll reaches her and they climb down a vine dangling from a cliff ledge. When Kong notices and starts pulling them back up, the two fall unharmed. They run through the jungle and back to the village, where Denham, Englehorn, and the surviving crewmen are waiting. Kong, following, breaks open the gate and relentlessly rampages through the village. Onshore, Denham, now determined to bring Kong back alive, knocks him unconscious with a <a href="/wiki/Chemical_warfare" title="Chemical warfare">gas bomb</a>.
</p><p>Shackled in chains, Kong is taken to New York City and presented to a <a href="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway theatre</a> audience as "Kong, the Eighth Wonder of the World". Ann and Jack are brought on stage to join him, surrounded by a group of press photographers. Kong, believing that the ensuing flash photography is an attack, breaks loose. The audience flees in horror. Ann is whisked away to a hotel room on a high floor, but Kong, scaling the building, soon finds her. His hand smashes through the hotel room window, immobilizing Jack, and abducts Ann again. Kong rampages through the city. He wrecks a crowded <a href="/wiki/Elevated_railway" title="Elevated railway">elevated train</a> and then climbs the <a href="/wiki/Empire_State_Building" title="Empire State Building">Empire State Building</a>. At its top, he is attacked by four airplanes. Kong destroys one, but finally succumbs to their gunfire. He ensures Ann's safety before falling to his death. Ann and Jack are reunited. Denham arrives and pushes through a crowd surrounding Kong's corpse in the street. When a policeman remarks that the planes got him, Denham tells him, "No, it wasn't the airplanes. It was Beauty  killed the Beast".

One of the rich customers, Ernest Brown, arranges a private rendezvous, during which Slick barges in and attempts to run a <a href="/wiki/Badger_game" title="Badger game">badger game</a> on the customer. The customer threatens to call the cops, so Slick whacks him over the head with a bottle. Mistakenly thinking he has killed the man, Slick flees, but is caught and jailed.
</p><p>Fearing that Slick will implicate her, Tira asks Big Bill for a loan to retain her lawyer, Bennie Pinkowitz (<a href="/wiki/Gregory_Ratoff" title="Gregory Ratoff">Gregory Ratoff</a>). He agrees on condition that she does her <a href="/wiki/Lion_taming" title="Lion taming">lion taming</a> act, which includes putting her head into the mouth of one of the beasts, promising her that it will get her (and him) to the "Big Show". It does.

</p><p>Tira tells Big Bill she is quitting to get married. Unwilling to lose his prize act, he has Slick, recently released from prison, sneak into Tira's penthouse suite, where Jack finds him in his robe. As a result, Jack breaks off the engagement. Tira sues Jack for breach of promise. The defense tries to use her past relationships to discredit her, but the judge allows her to cross examine the witnesses herself and in doing so she wins over not only the judge and jury, but also Jack. Jack agrees to give her a big settlement check. When he goes to see her, Tira tears up the check, and the two reconcile.
</p><p>On the last day of 1899, Jane and Robert Marryot, an upper-class couple, return to their townhouse in a fashionable area of London before midnight, so they can keep their tradition of celebrating the new year with a midnight toast. Although Jane and Robert have been married for some years and have two young sons, Edward and Joey, they are still very much in love. Jane worries because Robert has joined the <a href="/wiki/City_of_London_Imperial_Volunteers" title="City of London Imperial Volunteers">City of London Imperial Volunteers</a> (CIV) as an officer, and will soon be leaving to serve in the <a href="/wiki/Second_Boer_War" title="Second Boer War">Second Boer War</a>, where Jane's brother is already fighting in the <a href="/wiki/Siege_of_Mafeking" title="Siege of Mafeking">Siege of Mafeking</a>. Downstairs, the Marryots' butler Alfred Bridges mixes punch for their toast, while Cook dons her finest outfit to attend the public outdoor celebrations. Alfred has joined the CIV as a private and is also leaving soon. His wife Ellen, the Marryots' maid, worries about what will become of her and their new baby Fanny if Alfred is killed or seriously injured, but he is confident despite the pessimistic predictions of Ellen's elderly mother, Mrs. Snapper. At midnight, the Marryot and Bridges families ring in the new century while Cook dances with other revelers in the street.
</p><p>Shortly thereafter, Jane bids an emotional farewell to Robert at the dock when he boards the troop ship bound for Africa, while Ellen tearfully sees off Alfred, who is leaving on the same ship. While Robert is away, Jane's friend Margaret Harris keeps her company and gives her emotional support. Margaret's young daughter Edith plays Boer War games with Edward and Joey Marryot using toy soldiers and cannons, which distresses Jane. While Jane and Margaret are attending a comic <a href="/wiki/Operetta" title="Operetta">operetta</a> at the theatre to take Jane's mind off the war, the relief of Mafeking is announced from the stage, and the audience cheers. Robert and Alfred soon return home unharmed, to the delight of their families, and Robert is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Knighthood" title="Knighthood">knighted</a> for his service.
</p><p>Upon his arrival, Alfred announces to his wife and mother-in-law that he has bought his own pub with money partly provided by Robert, and he and Ellen will be leaving service and moving to a flat, along with Fanny and Mrs. Snapper. As the downstairs staff have a cup of tea to celebrate Alfred's return, they receive news of the <a href="/wiki/Queen_Victoria#Death_and_succession" title="Queen Victoria">death</a> of <a href="/wiki/Queen_Victoria" title="Queen Victoria">Queen Victoria</a>. Robert rides in the beginning part of her <a href="/wiki/Funeral_procession" title="Funeral procession">funeral procession</a> and the family and staff watch it from their upstairs windows.
</p><p>A few years later, in 1908, Alfred has developed <a href="/wiki/Alcoholism" title="Alcoholism">alcoholism</a> and is managing the pub poorly and getting behind on the family's rent due to spending the rent money on drink. Ellen and Fanny, now a schoolgirl, are embarrassed and put off by Alfred's drinking and slovenly appearance. Ellen carefully plans a genteel social evening when Jane Marryot and her son Edward, who is now in college at <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford" title="University of Oxford">Oxford</a>, pay a visit to the Bridges' flat. Ellen does not tell Alfred about the visit and lies to the Marryots that he can't attend due to a leg injury, but just as the Marryots are leaving, Alfred shows up drunk, acts rudely and destroys a doll that Jane had given Fanny, causing Fanny to run away into the street, where she distracts herself by dancing with some <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pearlies" title="Pearlies">Pearlies</a>. An angry Alfred chases Fanny, attacks the Pearlies, and then stumbles into the street where he is fatally run over by a <a href="/wiki/Horse-drawn_vehicle" title="Horse-drawn vehicle">horse-drawn</a> <a href="/wiki/Fire_engine" title="Fire engine">fire engine</a>.
</p><p>The following year, on July 25, 1909, Ellen and Fanny Bridges encounter the Marryot family again at the seaside, where Ellen explains that she and Fanny are living off the proceeds from the pub, now owned by Ellen. Fanny has become a talented dancer and singer. Edward Marryot has fallen in love with his childhood playmate Edith Harris. The family witnesses the <a href="/wiki/Louis_Bl%C3%A9riot#1909_Channel_crossing" title="Louis Blériot">historic flight</a> by <a href="/wiki/Louis_Bl%C3%A9riot" title="Louis Blériot">Louis Blériot</a> over the <a href="/wiki/English_Channel" title="English Channel">English Channel</a>.
</p><p>Three years later, by April 1912, Edward and Edith have married and are spending their honeymoon on a luxurious <a href="/wiki/Four-funnel_liner" title="Four-funnel liner">four-funneled ocean liner</a>, which is dramatically revealed by a camera shot on a <a href="/wiki/Personal_flotation_device" title="Personal flotation device">life preserver</a> on board to be the ill-fated <a href="/wiki/RMS_Titanic" title="RMS Titanic">RMS <i>Titanic</i></a>. Later scenes make it clear that Edward and Edith both perished in the <a href="/wiki/Sinking_of_the_RMS_Titanic" title="Sinking of the RMS Titanic">sinking</a>, although the sinking itself, their deaths, and their families' initial reaction to it are not shown, it is only briefly mentioned in later dialogue.
</p><p>Two years later, in 1914, <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> breaks out. Robert and Joe Marryot both serve as officers, thinking the war will be over within a few months. While on leave, Joe happens upon Fanny Bridges, whom he remembers from their childhood, performing as a featured singer and dancer in a nightclub. He re-introduces himself to her, and they bond while witnessing a <a href="/wiki/German_strategic_bombing_during_World_War_I" title="German strategic bombing during World War I">Zeppelin air raid</a> on London from the rooftop. She later becomes the star of a theatrical production. Fanny and Joe fall in love and Joe, who miraculously manages to survive the next four years of the war despite all his fellow officers being killed in action, spends most of his leave time with her, unbeknownst to his parents. He finally proposes, but she hesitates to say yes due to the difference in their <a href="/wiki/Social_class" title="Social class">social classes</a>, although she does love him. Just after <a href="/wiki/Armistice_of_11_November_1918" title="Armistice of 11 November 1918">armistice</a> is announced in 1918, Ellen, who has found out about Fanny and Joe's love affair, goes to see Jane, reveals the affair to her, and demands that Joe marry Fanny when he returns. While a surprised and upset Jane is arguing with Ellen, Jane receives a telegram informing her that Joe has been killed in battle. Later, a grief-stricken Jane walks sadly through armistice celebrations in <a href="/wiki/Trafalgar_Square" title="Trafalgar Square">Trafalgar Square</a>.
</p><p>Following the war, a montage shows daily life becoming even more chaotic and the social order being further disrupted, while some advocate that mankind work towards peace. The film ends on New Year's Day 1933, with Jane and Robert, now elderly, carrying on their tradition of celebrating the new year with a midnight toast to their past memories, as well as to the future.
</p><p>The story is set in New York City in the <a href="/wiki/Gay_Nineties" title="Gay Nineties">1890s</a>. A bawdy singer, Lady Lou (<a href="/wiki/Mae_West" title="Mae West">Mae West</a>), works in the <a href="/wiki/Bowery" title="Bowery">Bowery</a> barroom saloon of her boss and benefactor, Gus Jordan (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Noah_Beery" title="Noah Beery">Noah Beery</a>), who has given her many diamonds. But Lou is a lady with more men friends than anyone might imagine.
</p><p>What she does not know is that Gus trafficks in prostitution and runs a counterfeiting ring to help finance her expensive diamonds. He also sends young women to <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> to be pickpockets. Gus works with two other crooked entertainer-assistants, Russian Rita (<a href="/wiki/Rafaela_Ottiano" title="Rafaela Ottiano">Rafaela Ottiano</a>) and Rita's lover, the suave Sergei Stanieff (<a href="/wiki/Gilbert_Roland" title="Gilbert Roland">Gilbert Roland</a>). One of Gus's rivals and former "friend" of Lou's, named Dan Flynn (<a href="/wiki/David_Landau_(actor)" title="David Landau (actor)">David Landau</a>), spends most of the movie dropping hints to Lou that Gus is up to no good, promising to look after her once Gus is in jail. Lou leads him on, hinting at times that she will return to him, but eventually he loses patience and implies he'll see her jailed if she doesn't submit to him.
</p><p>A city mission is located next door to the bar. Its young director, Captain Cummings (<a href="/wiki/Cary_Grant" title="Cary Grant">Cary Grant</a>), is in reality an undercover <a href="/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States" title="Federal government of the United States">Federal</a> agent working to infiltrate and expose the illegal activities in the bar. Gus suspects nothing; he worries only that Cummings will reform his bar and scare away his customers.
</p><p>Lou's former boyfriend, Chick Clark (<a href="/wiki/Owen_Moore" title="Owen Moore">Owen Moore</a>), is a vicious criminal who was convicted of robbery and sent to prison for trying to steal diamonds for her. In his absence, she becomes attracted to the handsome young psalm-singing reformer.
</p><p>Warned that Chick thinks she's betrayed him, she goes to the prison to try to reassure him. All the inmates greet her warmly and familiarly  as she walks down the cellblock. Chick becomes angry and threatens to kill her if she double-crosses or two-times him before he gets out. She lies and claims she has been true to him. Gus gives counterfeit money to Rita and Sergei to spend. Chick escapes from jail, and police search for him in the bar. He comes into Lou's room and starts to strangle her, breaking off only because he still loves her and cannot harm her. Lou calms him down by promising that she will go with him when she finishes her next number.
</p><p>After Sergei gives Lou a diamond pin belonging to Rita, Rita starts a fight with Lou, who accidentally stabs her to death. Lou calmly combs the dead woman's long hair to hide the fact Rita is dead while the police search the room for Chick Clark. She has her bodyguard Spider (<a href="/wiki/Dewey_Robinson" title="Dewey Robinson">Dewey Robinson</a>), who "would do anything for you, Lou" dispose of Rita's body. She then tells Spider to bring Chick, who's hiding in an alley, back to her room upstairs. Then, while she sings "<a href="/wiki/Frankie_and_Johnny_(song)" title="Frankie and Johnny (song)">Frankie and Johnny</a>", she silently signals to Dan Flynn that he should go to her room to wait for her, even though she knows Chick is in there with a gun. Chick shoots Dan dead and the gunfire draws a police raid. Cummings shows his badge and reveals himself as "The Hawk", a well-known Federal agent, as he arrests Gus and Sergei. Chick, still lurking in Lou's room, is about to kill Lou for double-crossing him, when Cummings also apprehends him.
</p><p>Cummings then takes Lou away in an open horse-drawn carriage instead of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paddywagon" title="Paddywagon">paddywagon</a> into which all the other criminals have been loaded. He tells her she doesn't belong in jail and removes all her other rings and slips a diamond engagement ring onto her left ring finger.
</p><p>Playboy Captain Danilo (<a href="/wiki/Maurice_Chevalier" title="Maurice Chevalier">Maurice Chevalier</a>) is ordered by King Achmet of Marshovia (<a href="/wiki/George_Barbier_(actor)" title="George Barbier (actor)">George Barbier</a>) to court and marry Madame Sonia (<a href="/wiki/Jeanette_MacDonald" title="Jeanette MacDonald">Jeanette MacDonald</a>), a rich widow who owns a large portion of the kingdom.
</p><p>Spoiled heiress Ellen "Ellie" Andrews has eloped with pilot and fortune-hunter King Westley against the wishes of her extremely wealthy father, Alexander Andrews. Andrews wants to have the marriage annulled because he knows Westley is really only interested in her money. Jumping ship in Florida, she runs away and boards a <a href="/wiki/Greyhound_Lines" title="Greyhound Lines">Greyhound bus</a> to New York City to reunite with her husband. She meets fellow bus passenger Peter Warne, a freshly out-of-work newspaper reporter. Soon Peter recognizes her and gives her a choice: If she will give him an exclusive on her story, he will help her reunite with Westley. If not, he will tell her father where she is. Ellie agrees to the first choice.
</p><p>As they go through several adventures together, Ellie loses her initial disdain for him and begins to fall in love. When they have to <a href="/wiki/Hitchhiking" title="Hitchhiking">hitchhike</a>, they fail to secure a ride until Ellie displays a shapely leg to Danker, the next driver. When they stop <i>en route</i>, Danker tries to steal their luggage but Peter chases him down and seizes his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Model_T" title="Model T">Model T</a>. Nearing the end of their journey, Ellie confesses her love to Peter. When the owners of the motel in which they are staying notice that Peter's car is gone, they expel Ellie. Believing Peter has deserted her, Ellie telephones her father, who agrees to let her marry Westley. Meanwhile, Peter has obtained money from his editor to marry Ellie, but he misses her on the road. Although Ellie has no desire to be with Westley, she believes Peter has betrayed her for the reward money and agrees to have a second, formal wedding (with Westley).
</p><p>On the wedding day, she finally reveals the whole story to her father. When Peter comes to Ellie's home, Andrews offers him the reward money, but Peter insists on being paid only his expenses: a paltry $39.60 for items he had had to sell to buy gasoline. When Ellie's father presses him for an explanation of his odd behavior and demands to know if he loves her, Peter first tries to dodge the questions, but then admits he loves Ellie and storms out. Westley arrives for his wedding via <a href="/wiki/Autogyro" title="Autogyro">autogyro</a>; but at the ceremony, Andrews reveals to his daughter Peter's refusal of the reward money, and tells her that her car is waiting by the back gate in case she changes her mind about going through with the wedding. Ellie dumps Westley at the altar and bolts for her car, driving away as the newsreel cameras crank.
</p><p>A few days later, Andrews is working at his desk when Westley calls to tell him he is taking the financial settlement he was offered and won't contest the annulment. His executive assistant brings him a telegram from Peter, which says, "What's holding up the annulment, you slowpoke? The walls of Jericho are toppling!", referring to a makeshift wall made of a blanket over a wire tied across the rooms they slept in between them to give them privacy. With the annulment in hand, Andrews sends the reply, "Let 'em topple."
</p><p>In the last scene, we see Peter's battered Model T parked in a motor court in Glen Falls, Michigan. The mom and pop owners of the motor court talk, wondering why on such a warm night the newlyweds – he had seen the marriage license – wanted a clothesline, an extra blanket, and the little tin trumpet he had gotten for them. As they look at the cabin, the toy trumpet sounds a fanfare, the blanket falls to the floor, and the lights in the cabin go out.
</p><p>One night in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Portsmouth,_England" title="Portsmouth, England">Portsmouth, England</a> in 1787, a <a href="/wiki/Impressment" title="Impressment">press gang</a> breaks into a local tavern and presses all of the men drinking there into naval service.  One of the men inquires as to what ship they will sail on, and the press gang leader informs him that it is <a href="/wiki/HMS_Bounty" title="HMS Bounty">HMS <i>Bounty</i></a>. Upon inquiring as to who the captain is, another of the men is told the captain is <a href="/wiki/William_Bligh" title="William Bligh">William Bligh</a> (<a href="/wiki/Charles_Laughton" title="Charles Laughton">Charles Laughton</a>) and attempts to escape, as Bligh is a brutal tyrant who routinely administers harsh punishment to officers and crew alike who lack discipline, cause any infraction on board the ship, or in any manner defy his authority. The <i>Bounty</i> leaves England several days later on a two-year voyage over the Pacific Ocean. <a href="/wiki/Fletcher_Christian" title="Fletcher Christian">Fletcher Christian</a> (<a href="/wiki/Clark_Gable" title="Clark Gable">Clark Gable</a>), the ship's lieutenant, is a formidable yet compassionate man who disapproves of Bligh's treatment of the crew. Roger Byam (<a href="/wiki/Franchot_Tone" title="Franchot Tone">Franchot Tone</a>) is an idealistic midshipman who is divided between his loyalty to Bligh, owing to his family's naval tradition, and his friendship with Christian.
</p><p>During the voyage, the enmity between Christian and Bligh grows after Christian openly challenges Bligh's unjust practices aboard the ship. When the ship arrives at the island of <a href="/wiki/Tahiti" title="Tahiti">Tahiti</a>, where the crew acquires breadfruit plants to take to the West Indies, as intended, Bligh punishes Christian by refusing to let him leave the ship during their stay. Byam, meanwhile, sets up residency on the island, living with the island chief, Hitihiti (William Bambridge), and his daughter, Tehani (<a href="/wiki/Movita_Castaneda" title="Movita Castaneda">Movita Castaneda</a>), and compiling an English dictionary of the Tahitian language. Hitihiti persuades Bligh to allow Christian a day pass on the island. Bligh agrees but quickly repeals the pass out of spite. Christian disregards the order and spends his one-day off the ship romancing a Tahitian girl, Maimiti (<a href="/wiki/Mamo_Clark" title="Mamo Clark">Mamo Clark</a>). Christian promises her he will be back someday.
</p><p>After leaving Tahiti the crew begins to talk of mutiny after Bligh's harsh discipline leads to the death of the ship's beloved surgeon, Mr. Bacchus (<a href="/wiki/Dudley_Digges_(actor)" title="Dudley Digges (actor)">Dudley Digges</a>), and Bligh severely cuts water rationing to the crew in favor of providing more water for the breadfruit plants. Christian, although initially opposing the idea, decides he can no longer tolerate Bligh's brutality when he witnesses crew members shackled in iron chains, and he approves the mutiny. The crew raids the weapons cabinet and seizes the ship. Bligh and his loyalists are cast into a boat and set adrift at sea with a map and rations to ensure their survival. Due to Bligh's steady leadership, they are able to find their way back to land.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Christian orders that <i>Bounty</i> return to Tahiti. Byam, who was in his cabin during the mutiny, disapproves of what Christian has done and decides the two can no longer be friends. Months later, Byam is married to Tehani and Christian has married Maimiti and has a child with her, while the rest of the crew are enjoying their freedom on the island. After a long estrangement, Byam and Christian reconcile their friendship. However, when the British ship <a href="/wiki/HMS_Pandora_(1779)" title="HMS Pandora (1779)">HMS <i>Pandora</i></a> is spotted approaching, Byam and Christian decide they must part ways. Byam and several crew members remain on the island for the ship to take them back to England, while Christian leads the remaining crew, his wife and several Tahitian men and women back on board <i>Bounty</i> in search of a new island on which to seek refuge.
</p><p>Byam boards <i>Pandora</i> and, much to his surprise, discovers that Bligh is the captain. Bligh, who suspects that Byam was complicit in the mutiny, has him imprisoned for the remainder of the journey across the sea. Back in England Byam is court-martialed and found guilty of mutiny. Before the court condemns him, Byam speaks of Bligh's cruel, dehumanising conduct aboard <i>Bounty</i>. Due to the intervention of his friend Sir Joseph Banks (<a href="/wiki/Henry_Stephenson" title="Henry Stephenson">Henry Stephenson</a>) and Lord Hood (<a href="/wiki/David_Torrence" title="David Torrence">David Torrence</a>), Byam is pardoned by <a href="/wiki/George_III_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="George III of the United Kingdom">King George III</a> and allowed to resume his naval career at sea.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Christian has found Pitcairn, an uninhabited yet sustainable island that he believes will provide adequate refuge from the reach of the Royal Navy. After <i>Bounty</i> crashes on the rocks, Christian orders her to be burned.
</p><p>The film opens with two men in boxing gloves and trunks sparring vigorously. One knocks the other squarely down, concluding their session. Changing out of their exercise gear, the latter dons a natty suit, the former a priest's collar.
</p><p>The first man is "Blackie" Norton (<a href="/wiki/Clark_Gable" title="Clark Gable">Clark Gable</a>), a saloonkeeper and gambler. He owns the <i>Paradise Club</i> on Pacific Street in the notorious <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Barbary_Coast,_San_Francisco,_California" title="Barbary Coast, San Francisco, California">Barbary Coast</a>. The other is Blackie's childhood friend, Father Tim Mullen (<a href="/wiki/Spencer_Tracy" title="Spencer Tracy">Spencer Tracy</a>), a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_Catholic" title="Roman Catholic">Roman Catholic</a> priest.
</p><p>Blackie hires Mary Blake (<a href="/wiki/Jeanette_MacDonald" title="Jeanette MacDonald">Jeanette MacDonald</a>), a promising, but impoverished, classically trained singer from Benson, Colorado. She becomes a star attraction at the <i>Paradise</i>, especially for singing <a href="/wiki/Theme_from_San_Francisco" title="Theme from San Francisco">"San Francisco"</a> (a song composed for the movie, which became one of the city's official anthems).<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-sfmuseum.org_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-sfmuseum.org-5">[5]</a></sup> The club piano player, "The Professor" (<a href="/wiki/Al_Shean" title="Al Shean">Al Shean</a>), can tell Mary has a professionally trained voice. Mat (<a href="/wiki/Ted_Healy" title="Ted Healy">Ted Healy</a>), Blackie's good friend at the Paradise, wisely predicts that Mary is not going to stay on the "Coast".
</p><p>Father Tim makes several attempts to reform Blackie, while the other nightclub owners urge him to run for the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Board_of_Supervisors" title="San Francisco Board of Supervisors">San Francisco Board of Supervisors</a> in order to protect their crooked interests. Encouraged by Father Tim, who believes Blackie can use the supervisor position to implement reform, Blackie decides to run for office.  Despite Father Tim's best efforts, Blackie remains a jaunty Barbary Coast atheist, although Blackie secretly paid for the new organ in Father Tim's church.
</p><p>Blackie's feelings for Mary intensify, but complications arise when she is offered an opportunity to sing in the opera.  Although she initially refuses to break her contract with Blackie, she later leaves the <i>Paradise Club</i> due to the overtly sexual manifestation of Blackie's feelings for her.
</p><p>Mary is hired by the Tivoli Opera House on Market Street. There she becomes involved with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nob_Hill" title="Nob Hill">Nob Hill</a> scion Jack Burley (<a href="/wiki/Jack_Holt_(actor)" title="Jack Holt (actor)">Jack Holt</a>). Blackie wants to stop Mary singing at the Tivoli: he arrives the night of her premiere with a process server in tow to shut down the show. However, when he hears her sing he decides not to stop the opera. After her performance, Blackie visits Mary in her dressing room. Realizing she still loves him, Mary forwardly asks him to marry her.  Blackie agrees, but their reunion is soon interrupted by Burley, who had proclaimed his love for Mary and proposed to her prior to the show.  Blackie, seeing Burley as competition for Mary's affections, is happy to tell him of their intent to marry.  However, as Blackie gloatingly tells Burley of their plans, it becomes clear that Blackie intends to take Mary away from the Tivoli and put her back on stage at the <i>Paradise</i>.  Burley appeals to Mary, but Blackie presents Mary with an ultimatum by asking if she wants to marry him or stay at the Tivoli.
</p><p>Mary's choice is to return to the <i>Paradise</i>.  Backstage, before the opening night of her return performance, she asks Blackie if they can set the date for their wedding.  Blackie agrees, but wants to postpone getting married until after the election. Father Tim drops in, and is angered by Mary's skimpy stage costume. He defies Blackie to put her on the stage in front of the rowdy <i>Paradise</i> audience.  Mary observes Blackie's reaction to Father Tim's statements, and decides to leave with the priest after Blackie strikes him in the face.
</p><p>Mary goes back to Burley and eventually meets his mother (<a href="/wiki/Jessie_Ralph" title="Jessie Ralph">Jessie Ralph</a>) at her <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nob_Hill" title="Nob Hill">Nob Hill</a> mansion. In a private conversation, she confesses her unworthiness, but Mrs. Burley informs Mary that she started out in 1850 as Massie, a simple washerwoman in <a href="/wiki/Portsmouth_Square" title="Portsmouth Square">Portsmouth Square</a>. Mrs. Burley also empathizes that she also once had a "Blackie" in her younger days, but chose to marry the more steadfast elder Burley.  This cements Mary's decision to accept Burley's proposal of marriage.
</p><p>It is now the evening of April 17, 1906.  Burley has called in some favors and had the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Police_Department" title="San Francisco Police Department">San Francisco Police Department</a> raid the <i>Paradise</i>, destroying its gambling equipment and running off the patrons. Blackie, distraught about the future of his club, ends up at the city's annual Chickens Ball.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> Mary and Burley are in attendance.  After performances by acts from the other Barbary Coast clubs, the MC requests the <i>Paradise's</i> entry. When no one steps on stage, Mary, just having learned of the club's closing, enters the Chickens Ball competition for the <i>Paradise</i>. She rouses the audience to join in a chorus of "San Francisco", and wins. However, Blackie angrily refuses the prize money, tossing the prize cup and gold coins to the stage floor. He angrily states that Mary had no right to sing on behalf of his club. Embarrassed, Mary is about to leave the ball with Burley.
</p><p>Then, at 5:13 a.m. April 18, 1906, <a href="/wiki/1906_San_Francisco_earthquake" title="1906 San Francisco earthquake">the earthquake hits the city</a>. The city is devastated and hundreds are killed.
</p><p>As Blackie wanders the city searching for Mary, he walks to Nob Hill, where he sees Mrs. Burley, who senses her son has died. (Blackie did indeed witness the dead Burley when wandering the devastated streets.)  She leaves the area as US Army troops from the <a href="/wiki/Presidio_of_San_Francisco" title="Presidio of San Francisco">Presidio</a> blow up her mansion in preparation making a <a href="/wiki/Firebreak" title="Firebreak">firebreak</a>. Blackie then comes upon Mat, who was injured at the destroyed Hall of Justice on Washington Street.  A nurse indicates to Blackie that Mat is dying. Before he dies, Mat tells Blackie he was wrong about his feelings toward Mary.
</p><p>Blackie later meets Father Tim, who takes him to <a href="/wiki/Golden_Gate_Park" title="Golden Gate Park">Golden Gate Park</a>, where there is a tent camp for the homeless. There, Blackie hears Mary's voice lifted in song "<a href="/wiki/Nearer,_My_God,_to_Thee" title="Nearer, My God, to Thee">Nearer, My God, to Thee</a>"  with those in mourning. After seeing Mary, Blackie falls to his knees and thanks God for sparing Mary's life. From a distance, Mary sees Blackie praying, and as she walks toward him, word spreads through the camp that "The fire's out!" As people shout about building a new San Francisco, Blackie and Mary join the crowd (a surprisingly multi-racial group, given the era of the film) as they leave the park marching arm-in-arm, singing "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Battle_Hymn_of_the_Republic" title="The Battle Hymn of the Republic">The Battle Hymn of the Republic</a>".  
</p><p>The film ends with a dissolve from the smoldering ruins into the "modern" San Francisco of the mid-1930s. (Each year when the film is shown near April 18 by Bay Area television stations, the scenes of the 1930s city are replaced with stock news footage of the city in the current year.)
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Snow_White_(Disney_character)" title="Snow White (Disney character)">Snow White</a> is a lonely princess living with her stepmother, a vain <a href="/wiki/Evil_Queen_(Disney)" title="Evil Queen (Disney)">Queen</a>. The Queen worries that Snow White will look better than she, so she forces Snow White to work as a <a href="/wiki/Scullery_maid" title="Scullery maid">scullery maid</a> and asks her <a href="/wiki/Magic_Mirror_(Snow_White)" title="Magic Mirror (Snow White)">Magic Mirror</a> daily "who is the fairest one of all". For years the mirror always answers that the Queen is, pleasing her.
</p><p>One day, the Magic Mirror informs the Queen that Snow White is now "the fairest" in the land. The jealous Queen orders her <a href="/wiki/Huntsman_(Snow_White)" title="Huntsman (Snow White)">Huntsman</a> to take Snow White into the forest and kill her. She further demands that the huntsman return with Snow White's heart in a jeweled box as proof of the deed. However, the Huntsman cannot bring himself to kill Snow White. He tearfully begs for her forgiveness, revealing the Queen wants her dead and urges her to flee into the woods and never look back. Lost and frightened, the princess is befriended by woodland creatures who lead her to a cottage deep in the woods. Finding seven small chairs in the cottage's dining room, Snow White assumes the cottage is the untidy home of seven orphaned children.
</p><p>In reality, the cottage belongs to seven adult <a href="/wiki/Dwarf_(mythology)" title="Dwarf (mythology)">dwarfs</a>—named Doc, Grumpy, Happy, Sleepy, Bashful, Sneezy, and Dopey—who work in a nearby mine. Returning home, they are alarmed to find their cottage clean and suspect that an intruder has invaded their home. The dwarfs find Snow White upstairs, asleep across three of their beds. Snow White awakes to find the dwarfs at her bedside and introduces herself, and all of the dwarfs eventually welcome her into their home after she offers to clean and cook for them. Snow White keeps house for the dwarfs while they mine for jewels during the day, and at night they all sing, play music and dance.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the Queen discovers that Snow White is still alive when the mirror again answers that Snow White is the fairest in the land and reveals that the heart in the jeweled box is actually that of a pig. Using a potion to disguise herself as an old <a href="/wiki/Hag" title="Hag">hag</a>, the Queen creates a poisoned apple that will put whoever eats it into the "Sleeping Death", a curse she learns can only be broken by "love's first kiss", but is certain Snow White will be buried alive. While the Queen goes to the cottage while the dwarfs are away, the animals are wary of her and rush off to find the dwarfs. Faking a potential heart attack, the Queen tricks Snow White into bringing her into the cottage to rest. The Queen fools Snow White into biting into the poisoned apple under the pretense that it is a magic apple that grants wishes. As Snow White falls asleep, the Queen proclaims that she is now the fairest of the land. The dwarfs return with the animals as the Queen leaves the cottage and give chase, trapping her on a cliff. She tries to roll a boulder over them, but before she can do so, lightning strikes the cliff, causing her to fall to her death.
</p><p>The dwarfs return to their cottage and find Snow White seemingly dead, being kept in a deathlike slumber by the poison. Unwilling to bury her out of sight in the ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin trimmed with gold in a clearing in the forest. Together with the woodland creatures, they keep watch over her. A year later, a prince who had previously met and fallen in love with Snow White learns of her eternal sleep and visits her coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the Prince takes Snow White to his castle.
</p><p>A successful banker, Anthony P. Kirby (<a href="/wiki/Edward_Arnold_(actor)" title="Edward Arnold (actor)">Edward Arnold</a>), has just returned from <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, where he was effectively granted a government-sanctioned <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Munitions" title="Munitions">munitions</a> <a href="/wiki/Monopoly" title="Monopoly">monopoly</a>, which will make him very rich. He intends to buy up a 12-block radius around a competitor's factory to put him out of business, but there is one house that is a holdout to selling. Kirby instructs his real estate broker, John Blakely (<a href="/wiki/Clarence_Wilson_(actor)" title="Clarence Wilson (actor)">Clarence Wilson</a>), to offer a huge sum for the house, and if that is not accepted, to cause trouble for the family.  Meanwhile Grandpa Vanderhof (<a href="/wiki/Lionel_Barrymore" title="Lionel Barrymore">Lionel Barrymore</a>) convinces a banker named Poppins to pursue his dream of making animated toys.
</p><p>Kirby's son, Tony (<a href="/wiki/James_Stewart" title="James Stewart">James Stewart</a>), a vice president in the family company, has fallen in love with a company <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stenographer" title="Stenographer">stenographer</a>, Alice Sycamore (<a href="/wiki/Jean_Arthur" title="Jean Arthur">Jean Arthur</a>). When Tony proposes marriage, Alice is worried that her family would be looked upon poorly by Tony's rich and famous family. In fact, Alice is the only relatively normal member of the eccentric Sycamore family, led by Vanderhof. Unbeknownst to the players, Alice's family lives in the house that will not sell out.
</p><p>Kirby and his wife (<a href="/wiki/Mary_Forbes" title="Mary Forbes">Mary Forbes</a>) strongly disapprove of Tony's choice for marriage. Before she accepts, Alice forces Tony to bring his family to become better acquainted with their future in-laws. But when Tony purposely brings his family on the wrong day, the Sycamore family is caught off-guard and the house is in disarray. As the Kirbys are preparing to leave after a rather disastrous meeting, the police arrive in response to the printed threats on Ed Carmichael's flyers, and when the fireworks in the basement go off, they arrest everyone in the house.
</p><p>Held up in the <a href="/wiki/Drunk_tank" title="Drunk tank">drunk tank</a> preparing to see the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Night_court" title="Night court">night court</a> judge, Mrs. Kirby repeatedly insults Alice and makes her feel unworthy of her son, while Grandpa explains to Kirby the importance of having friends and that despite all the wealth and success in business, "you can't take it with you". At the court hearing, the judge (<a href="/wiki/Harry_Davenport_(actor)" title="Harry Davenport (actor)">Harry Davenport</a>) allows for Grandpa and his family to settle the charges for disturbing the peace and making illegal fireworks by assessing a fine, which Grandpa's friends pitch in to pay for. He repeatedly asks why the Kirbys were at the Vanderhof house. When Grandpa says it was to talk over selling the house, Alice has an outburst and says it was because she was engaged to Tony but is spurning him because of how poorly she has been treated by his family. This causes a sensation in the papers, and Alice flees the city.
</p><p>With Alice gone, Grandpa decides to sell the house, thus meaning the whole section of the town must vacate in preparation for building a new factory. Now, the Kirby companies merge, creating a huge fluctuation in the stock market.  When Kirby's competitor, Ramsey (<a href="/wiki/H._B._Warner" title="H. B. Warner">H. B. Warner</a>), dies after confronting him for being ruthless and a failure of a man, Kirby has a realization he is heading for the same fate, and decides to leave the meeting where the signing the contracts is to take place.
</p><p>As the Vanderhofs are moving out of the house, Tony tries to track down Alice. Kirby arrives and talks privately with Grandpa, sharing his realization. Grandpa responds by inviting him to play "<a href="/wiki/Polly_Wolly_Doodle" title="Polly Wolly Doodle">Polly Wolly Doodle</a>" on the harmonica that he gave him. The two let loose with the rest of the family joining in the merriment, and with Alice taking Tony back. Later, at the dinner table, Grandpa says grace for the Sycamore family and the Kirbys, revealing that Kirby has sold back the houses on the block.

Scarlett learns that <a href="/wiki/Ashley_Wilkes" title="Ashley Wilkes">Ashley Wilkes</a>—whom she secretly loves—is to be <a href="/wiki/Cousin_marriage" title="Cousin marriage">married to his cousin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Melanie_Hamilton" title="Melanie Hamilton">Melanie Hamilton</a>, and the engagement is to be announced the next day at a barbecue at Ashley's home, the nearby plantation <a href="/wiki/Twelve_Oaks" title="Twelve Oaks">Twelve Oaks</a>.
</p><p>At the Twelve Oaks party, Scarlett privately declares her feelings to Ashley, but he rebuffs her by responding that he and Melanie are more compatible. Scarlett is incensed when she discovers another guest, <a href="/wiki/Rhett_Butler" title="Rhett Butler">Rhett Butler</a>, has overheard their conversation. The barbecue is disrupted by the declaration of war and the men rush to enlist. As Scarlett watches Ashley kiss Melanie goodbye, Melanie's younger brother Charles proposes to her. Although she does not love him, Scarlett consents and they are married before he leaves to fight.
</p><p>Scarlett is widowed when Charles dies from a bout of <a href="/wiki/Pneumonia" title="Pneumonia">pneumonia</a> and <a href="/wiki/Measles" title="Measles">measles</a> while serving in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Confederate_Army" title="Confederate Army">Confederate Army</a>. Scarlett's mother sends her to the Hamilton home in <a href="/wiki/Atlanta" title="Atlanta">Atlanta</a> to cheer her up, although the O'Haras' outspoken house slave Mammy tells Scarlett she knows she is going there only to wait for Ashley's return. Scarlett, who should not attend a party while in mourning, attends a charity bazaar in Atlanta with Melanie where she meets Rhett again, now a <a href="/wiki/Blockade_runner" title="Blockade runner">blockade runner</a> for the <a href="/wiki/Confederate_States_of_America" title="Confederate States of America">Confederacy</a>. Celebrating a Confederate victory and to raise money for the Confederate war effort, gentlemen are invited to bid for ladies to dance with them. Rhett makes an inordinately large bid for Scarlett and, to the disapproval of the guests, she agrees to dance with him.
</p><p>The tide of war turns against the Confederacy after the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Gettysburg" title="Battle of Gettysburg">Battle of Gettysburg</a> in which many of the men of Scarlett's town are killed. Scarlett makes another unsuccessful appeal to Ashley while he is visiting on Christmas <a href="/wiki/Furlough" title="Furlough">furlough</a>, although they do share a private and passionate kiss in the parlor on Christmas Day, just before he returns to war.
</p><p>Eight months later, as the city is besieged by the <a href="/wiki/Union_Army" title="Union Army">Union Army</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Atlanta_Campaign" title="Atlanta Campaign">Atlanta Campaign</a>, Scarlett and her young house slave Prissy must deliver Melanie's baby without medical assistance after she goes into premature labor. Afterwards, Scarlett calls upon Rhett to take her home to Tara with Melanie, her baby, and Prissy; he collects them in a horse and wagon, but once out of the city chooses to go off to fight, leaving Scarlett and the group to make their own way back to Tara. Upon her return home, Scarlett finds Tara deserted, except for her father, her sisters, and two former slaves: Mammy and Pork. Scarlett learns that her mother has just died of <a href="/wiki/Typhoid_fever" title="Typhoid fever">typhoid fever</a> and her father has become incompetent. With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett vows she will do anything for the survival of her family and herself.
</p><p>As the O'Haras work in the cotton fields, Scarlett's father is killed after he is thrown from his horse in an attempt to chase away a <a href="/wiki/Scalawag" title="Scalawag">scalawag</a> from his land. With the defeat of the Confederacy, Ashley also returns, but finds he is of little help at Tara. When Scarlett begs him to run away with her, he confesses his desire for her and kisses her passionately, but says he cannot leave Melanie. Unable to pay the taxes on Tara implemented by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Reconstruction_Era" title="Reconstruction Era">Reconstructionists</a>, Scarlett dupes her younger sister Suellen's fiancé, the middle-aged and wealthy mill owner Frank Kennedy, into marrying her, by saying Suellen got tired of waiting and married another suitor.
</p><p>Frank, Ashley, Rhett and several other accomplices make a night raid on a <a href="/wiki/Shanty_town" title="Shanty town">shanty town</a> after Scarlett is attacked while driving through it alone, resulting in Frank's death. With Frank's funeral barely over, Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she accepts. They have a daughter whom Rhett names Bonnie Blue, but Scarlett, still pining for Ashley and chagrined at the perceived ruin of her figure, lets Rhett know that she wants no more children and that they will no longer share a bed.
</p><p>One day at Frank's mill, Scarlett and Ashley are seen embracing by Ashley's sister, India, and harboring an intense dislike of Scarlett she eagerly spreads rumors. Later that evening, Rhett, having heard the rumors, forces Scarlett to attend a birthday party for Ashley. Incapable of believing anything bad of her, Melanie stands by Scarlett's side so that all know that she believes the gossip to be false. After returning home from the party, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk, and they argue about Ashley. Rhett kisses Scarlett against her will, stating his intent to have sex with her that night, and carries the struggling Scarlett to the bedroom. The next day, Rhett apologizes for his behavior and offers Scarlett a divorce, which she rejects, saying that it would be a disgrace. When Rhett returns from an extended trip to London, Scarlett informs him that she is pregnant, but an argument ensues which results in her falling down a flight of stairs and suffering a <a href="/wiki/Miscarriage" title="Miscarriage">miscarriage</a>. As she is recovering, tragedy strikes when Bonnie dies while attempting to jump a fence with her pony.
</p><p>Scarlett and Rhett visit Melanie, who has suffered complications arising from a new pregnancy, on her deathbed. As Scarlett consoles Ashley, Rhett prepares to leave Atlanta.

</p><p><a href="/wiki/Jiminy_Cricket" title="Jiminy Cricket">Jiminy Cricket</a> explains that he is going to tell a story of a wish coming true. His story begins in the Italian workshop of a woodworker named <a href="/wiki/Mister_Geppetto" title="Mister Geppetto">Geppetto</a>. Jiminy watches as Geppetto finishes work on a wooden marionette whom he names <a href="/wiki/Pinocchio" title="Pinocchio">Pinocchio</a>. Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio will be a real boy. During the night, a <a href="/wiki/The_Fairy_with_Turquoise_Hair" title="The Fairy with Turquoise Hair">Blue Fairy</a> visits the workshop and brings Pinocchio to life, although he still remains a puppet. She informs him that if he proves himself brave, truthful, and unselfish, he will become a real boy, and assigns Jiminy to be his conscience.
</p><p>Geppetto discovers that his wish has come true, and is filled with joy. However, on his way to school, Pinocchio is led astray by <a href="/wiki/The_Fox_and_the_Cat" title="The Fox and the Cat">Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat</a>, who convince him to join <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stromboli_(Pinocchio)" title="Stromboli (Pinocchio)">Stromboli</a>'s puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio, and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy appears, and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. Pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the Blue Fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets him free, while warning him that this will be the last time she can help him.
</p><p>Meanwhile, across town, Honest John and Gideon meet a <a href="/wiki/The_Coachman" title="The Coachman">coachman</a> who promises to pay them money if they can find naughty little boys for him to take to <a href="/wiki/Land_of_Toys" title="Land of Toys">Pleasure Island</a>. Encountering Pinocchio on his way home, they convince him that he needs to take a vacation there. On the way to Pleasure Island, he befriends <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Candlewick_(Pinocchio_character)" title="Candlewick (Pinocchio character)">Lampwick</a>, a delinquent boy. Without rules or authority to enforce their activity, Pinocchio and the other boys soon engage in <a href="/wiki/Tobacco_smoking" title="Tobacco smoking">smoking</a> <a href="/wiki/Tobacco" title="Tobacco">tobacco</a>, <a href="/wiki/Gambling" title="Gambling">gambling</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vandalism" title="Vandalism">vandalism</a>, and getting <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Drunk" title="Drunk">drunk</a>, much to Jiminy's dismay. Later, while trying to get home, Jiminy discovers that the island hides a horrible curse: the boys brought to Pleasure Island are transformed into <a href="/wiki/Donkey" title="Donkey">donkeys</a> for their misbehavior and sold into slave labor. Jiminy runs back to warn Pinocchio, only to discover that Lampwick has transformed into a donkey; Pinocchio manages to escape the island, only partially transformed.
</p><p>Upon returning home, Pinocchio and Jiminy find the workshop vacant. They soon get a letter from the blue fairy as a dove, stating that Geppetto had ventured out to sea to save Pinocchio from Pleasure Island, but was swallowed by a giant <a href="/wiki/Sperm_whale" title="Sperm whale">Sperm whale</a> named <a href="/wiki/The_Terrible_Dogfish" title="The Terrible Dogfish">Monstro</a>, and is now living in his belly. Determined to rescue his father, Pinocchio jumps into the sea accompanied by Jiminy. Pinocchio is soon swallowed by Monstro as well, where he is reunited with Geppetto. Pinocchio devises a scheme to make Monstro sneeze, giving them a chance to escape. The scheme works, but the enraged Whale chases them and smashes their raft. Pinocchio pulls Geppetto to safety in a cave before Monstro crashes into it. Geppetto, Figaro, Cleo, and Jiminy are washed up safely on a beach, but Pinocchio is killed.
</p><p>Back home, Geppetto grieves over Pinocchio with Jiminy Cricket and the pets also mourn alongside. The Blue Fairy, however, decides that Pinocchio has proven himself brave, truthful, and unselfish. To reward him, the Blue Fairy resurrects Pinocchio, reversing the Pleasure Island curse and turning him into a real boy. Pinocchio awakens and reveals that he is alive and a real human boy, and everyone celebrates. Jiminy steps outside to thank the Fairy, and is rewarded with a solid gold badge that certifies him as an official conscience.

Without enough money, they steal drilling equipment from a skeptical Luther Aldrich (<a href="/wiki/Frank_Morgan" title="Frank Morgan">Frank Morgan</a>). Their well proves a bust and they have to hastily depart when Aldrich shows up with the sheriff to take back his property. The two oilmen team up and make enough money to partially pay Aldrich. To get him to back them for a second try, they cut him in for a percentage of the well. This time, they strike it rich.
</p><p>When Elizabeth 'Betsy' Bartlett (<a href="/wiki/Claudette_Colbert" title="Claudette Colbert">Claudette Colbert</a>) shows up, McMasters sweeps her off her feet (without knowing that Sand considers her his girl) and marries her. Sand accepts the situation, wanting Betsy to be happy. However, on their first anniversary, she catches her husband dancing with a barroom floozy. As a result, Sand quarrels with McMasters and they flip a coin for the entire oilfield. Betsy leaves too, but returns when she learns that her husband has lost almost everything to Sand and needs her.

</p><p>Meanwhile, Sand loses everything he has built up in South America to a revolution. When he meets McMasters at an oilmen's convention, the two finally reconcile, and Sand goes to work for his old friend. When he suspects that McMasters is carrying on an affair with Karen, he tries to save Betsy's marriage by offering to marry Karen. However, she deduces his motives and declines. When a miserable Betsy tries to commit suicide by taking sleeping pills, Sand decides that the only way to help her is to bankrupt McMasters. Sand loses his costly battle with his former friend and goes broke. It is only when he asks McMasters to give his wife a divorce that the married man finally comes to his senses. Later, McMasters is prosecuted by the government for violating the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act" title="Sherman Antitrust Act">Sherman Antitrust Act</a> and loses his business. In the end, poor, but happier, Sand and McMasters team up again, with the blissful Betsy looking on. Aldrich supplies them with equipment and the whole cycle begins again.
</p><p>The film begins in the summer of 1916. Alvin York, a poor young farmer from the rural area near <a href="/wiki/Pall_Mall,_Tennessee" title="Pall Mall, Tennessee">Pall Mall, Tennessee</a>, lives a hardscrabble existence in a community whose poverty and isolation leave them with a lifestyle hardly different from people of a century earlier. He is an exceptional marksman, but a ne'er-do-well prone to drinking and fighting, which does not make things any easier for his long-suffering, widowed mother. 
</p><p>Alvin's farm is on rocky land high in the mountains, which barely supports him and his siblings. He meets a sweet-natured local girl, Gracie Williams, and works night and day at strenuous odd jobs to accumulate the payment for a fertile "bottomland" farm so she'll marry him.  The owner, Tomkins, gives Alvin sixty days to raise the purchase price. On the day the last payment is due, Alvin wins the final needed amount at a target-shooting contest, but discovers Tomkins has reneged and sold the farm to Alvin's romantic rival, Zeb Andrews, keeping all of the partial payments Alvin had made. Alvin drinks heavily and swears revenge.
</p><p>That night, en route to attack Tomkins and Andrews, the rifle Alvin is holding is struck by lightning, splitting the barrel in two and knocking him off his mule. Similar to <a href="/wiki/Conversion_of_Paul_the_Apostle" title="Conversion of Paul the Apostle">the biblical conversion of Paul</a>, York survives the lightning strike and undergoes a religious awakening when he joins a revival meeting at the nearby church, vowing never to get drunk or angry again.  He makes amends with the men who cheated him out of the land, while Gracie points out that her love is tied to him and not the bottomland.
</p><p>When the U.S. enters <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a> and York is drafted into the army, he tries to avoid induction into the Army as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Conscientious_objection" title="Conscientious objection">conscientious objector</a>, but is denied since his church has no official standing. He reluctantly reports to <a href="/wiki/Fort_Gordon" title="Fort Gordon">Camp Gordon</a> for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Basic_training" title="Basic training">basic training</a>, where he is harassed because of his objector status, but his superiors eventually discover that he is a phenomenal marksman and decide to promote him to <a href="/wiki/Corporal#United_States" title="Corporal">corporal</a>.
</p><p>York still wants nothing to do with the Army and killing. Major <a href="/wiki/G._Edward_Buxton_Jr." title="G.

</p><p>While York is fasting and pondering, the wind blows his Bible open to the verse "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's."

Pinned down by deadly machine gun fire, the lieutenant orders Sergeant Early to take some men and try to attack the machine gun nests from behind. York suddenly finds himself the last remaining unwounded <a href="/wiki/Non-commissioned_officer" title="Non-commissioned officer">non-commissioned officer</a> in the detachment, and is placed in command by Early.
</p><p>Seeing his comrades being shot down all around him, his self-doubt disappears. He works his way to a position flanking the main enemy trench and, as a sniper, fires individual rifle shots with such devastating effect that the Germans surrender. Then, York forces a captured officer at gunpoint to order the Germans still fighting in another section of the line to also surrender. He and the handful of other survivors end up with 132 prisoners. York becomes a national hero and is awarded the <a href="/wiki/Medal_of_Honor" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honor</a>. When Major Buxton asks him why he did what he did, York explains that he was trying to save the lives of his men.
</p><p>Arriving in New York City in early 1919, York receives a ticker tape parade and a key to the city.  He is impressed with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Waldorf-Astoria_hotel" title="Waldorf-Astoria hotel">Waldorf-Astoria hotel</a> and its indoor electricity.  Congressman <a href="/wiki/Cordell_Hull" title="Cordell Hull">Cordell Hull</a> guides him through the city and informs him that he has been offered opportunities to commercialize on his fame, all totaling around $250,000 (for context, $3.6 million today). York mentions the bottomland he wanted and Hull responds he could buy it with the money. York rejects the offers, however, saying that he was not proud of what he did in the war, but it had to be done, and he will not profit from his fame. He tells Hull he wants to go home. He returns to <a href="/wiki/Tennessee" title="Tennessee">Tennessee</a> greeted by Gracie and his family. To his surprise, the people of his home state have bought him the bottomland farm he wanted and built him a house on the land.
</p><p>A doe gives birth to a fawn named Bambi, who will one day take over the position of Great Prince of the Forest, a title currently held by Bambi's father, who guards the woodland creatures from the dangers of hunters. The fawn is quickly befriended by an eager, energetic rabbit named <a href="/wiki/Thumper_(Bambi)" title="Thumper (Bambi)">Thumper</a>, who helps to teach him to walk and speak. Bambi grows up very attached to his mother, with whom he spends most of his time. He soon makes other friends, including a young skunk named Flower and a female fawn named <a href="/wiki/Faline" title="Faline">Faline</a>. Curious and inquisitive, Bambi frequently asks about the world around him and is cautioned about the dangers of life as a forest creature by his loving mother. One day out in a meadow, Bambi briefly sees The Great Prince but does not realize that he is his father. As the great prince wanders uphill, he discovers the human hunter named "Man" by all the animals is coming and rushes down to the meadow to get everyone to safety. Bambi is briefly separated from his mother during that scene but is escorted to her by the Great Prince as the three of them make it back in the forest just as Man fires his gun.
</p><p>During Bambi's first winter, he and Thumper play in the snow while Flower hibernates. One day his mother takes him along to find food, when Man shows up again. As they escape his mother is shot and killed by the hunter, leaving the little fawn mournful and alone. Taking pity on his abandoned son, the Great Prince leads Bambi home as he reveals to him that he is his father. Next year, Bambi has matured into a young stag, and his childhood friends have entered young adulthood as well. They are warned of "twitterpation" by Friend Owl and that they will eventually fall in love, although the trio view the concept of romance with scorn. However, Thumper and Flower soon both encounter their beautiful romantic counterparts and abandon their former thoughts on love. Bambi himself encounters Faline as a beautiful doe. However, their courtship is quickly interrupted and challenged by a belligerent older stag named Ronno, who attempts to force Faline away from Bambi. Bambi successfully manages to defeat Ronno in battle and earn the rights to the doe's affections.
</p><p>Bambi is awakened shortly afterward by the smell of smoke, he follows it and discovers it leads to a hunter camp. Bambi is warned by his father that Man has returned with more hunters. The two flee to safety, although Bambi is separated from Faline in the turmoil and searches for her along the way. He soon finds her cornered by Man's vicious hunting dogs, which he manages to ward off. Meanwhile at the "Man's" camp, their campfire suddenly spreads into the forest, resulting in a wildfire from which the forest residents flee in fear. Bambi, his father, Faline, and the forest animals manage to reach shelter on a <a href="/wiki/Bank_(geography)" title="Bank (geography)">riverbank</a>. The following spring, Faline gives birth to twins under Bambi's watchful eye as the new Great Prince of the Forest.

The house has a large garden, with a private landing stage on the <a href="/wiki/River_Thames" title="River Thames">River Thames</a> at which is moored a motorboat belonging to her devoted husband, Clem (<a href="/wiki/Walter_Pidgeon" title="Walter Pidgeon">Walter Pidgeon</a>), a successful architect. They have three children: the youngsters Toby (<a href="/wiki/Christopher_Severn" title="Christopher Severn">Christopher Severn</a>) and Judy (<a href="/wiki/Clare_Sandars" title="Clare Sandars">Clare Sandars</a>), and an older son, Vin (<a href="/wiki/Richard_Ney" title="Richard Ney">Richard Ney</a>), a student at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oxford_University" title="Oxford University">Oxford University</a>. They have live-in staff: Gladys, the housemaid (<a href="/wiki/Brenda_Forbes" title="Brenda Forbes">Brenda Forbes</a>), and Ada, the cook (<a href="/wiki/Marie_De_Becker" title="Marie De Becker">Marie De Becker</a>).
</p><p>As <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> looms, Vin returns from the university and meets Carol Beldon (<a href="/wiki/Teresa_Wright" title="Teresa Wright">Teresa Wright</a>), granddaughter of Lady Beldon (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dame_May_Whitty" title="Dame May Whitty">Dame May Whitty</a>) from nearby Beldon Hall. Despite initial disagreements—mainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruism—they fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic, but more honest, proposal. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must "do his bit", and enlists in the <a href="/wiki/Royal_Air_Force" title="Royal Air Force">Royal Air Force</a>, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home, and is able to signal his safe return from operations to his parents by "blipping" his engine briefly (rapidly open and closing the throttle, which results in short, sharp roars of sound) as he flies over the house. Together with other boat owners, Clem volunteers to take his motorboat, the <i>Starling</i>, to assist in the <a href="/wiki/Dunkirk_evacuation" title="Dunkirk evacuation">Dunkirk evacuation</a>.
</p><p>Early one morning, Kay, unable to sleep as Clem is still away, wanders down to the landing stage. She is startled to discover a wounded <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">German</a> pilot (<a href="/wiki/Helmut_Dantine" title="Helmut Dantine">Helmut Dantine</a>) hiding in her garden, and he takes her to the house at gunpoint. Demanding food and a coat, the pilot aggressively asserts that the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Third_Reich" title="Third Reich">Third Reich</a> will mercilessly overcome its enemies. She feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and then calls the police. Soon after, Clem returns home, exhausted, from Dunkirk.
</p><p>Lady Beldon visits Kay to try and convince her to talk Vin out of marrying Carol on account of her granddaughter's comparative youth at age eighteen. Kay reminds Her Ladyship that she, too, had been young — sixteen, in fact — when she married her late husband. Lady Beldon concedes defeat, and realizes that it would be futile to try to stop the marriage. Vin and Carol marry; Carol has now also become a Mrs Miniver, and they return from their honeymoon in <a href="/wiki/Scotland" title="Scotland">Scotland</a>. A key theme is that she knows Vin is likely to be killed in action, but the short love will fill her life. Later, Kay and her family take refuge in their <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anderson_shelter" title="Anderson shelter">Anderson shelter</a> in the garden during an air raid, and attempt to keep their minds off the frightening bombing by reading <i><a href="/wiki/Alice%27s_Adventures_in_Wonderland" title="Alice's Adventures in Wonderland">Alice's Adventures in Wonderland</a></i>, which Clem refers to as a "lovely story". They barely survive as a bomb destroys part of Starlings. The Minivers take the damage with nonchalance.
</p><p>At the annual village flower show, Lady Beldon silently disregards the judges' decision that her rose is the winner, instead announcing the rose entered by the local stationmaster, Mr. Ballard (<a href="/wiki/Henry_Travers" title="Henry Travers">Henry Travers</a>), named the "Mrs. Miniver", as the winner, with her own Beldon Rose taking second prize. As air raid sirens sound, and the villagers take refuge in the cellars of Beldon Hall, Kay and Carol drive Vin to join his squadron. On their journey home, they witness fighter planes in a dogfight. For safety, Kay stops the car, and they see a German plane crash. Kay realizes Carol has been wounded by machine gun fire from the plane, and takes her back to Starlings. She dies a few minutes after they reach home. Kay is devastated. When Vin returns from battle, he already knows the terrible news: Ironically, he is the survivor, and she the one who died.
</p><p>The villagers assemble at the badly damaged church where their vicar affirms their determination in a powerful sermon:
</p><p>A solitary Lady Beldon stands in her family's church pew. Vin moves to stand alongside her, united in shared grief, as the members of the congregation rise and stoically sing "<a href="/wiki/Onward,_Christian_Soldiers" title="Onward, Christian Soldiers">Onward, Christian Soldiers</a>", while through a gaping hole in the bombed church roof can be seen flight after flight of RAF fighters in the V-for-Victory formation heading out to face the enemy.
</p><p>During the <a href="/wiki/Spanish_Civil_War" title="Spanish Civil War">Spanish Civil War</a>, an American language teacher, Robert Jordan (<a href="/wiki/Gary_Cooper" title="Gary Cooper">Gary Cooper</a>), who lived in Spain during the pre-war period, fights in the <a href="/wiki/International_Brigades" title="International Brigades">International Brigades</a> against <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Franco" title="Francisco Franco">Francisco Franco</a>'s forces. An experienced dynamiter, Jordan is ordered to travel behind enemy lines and destroy a critical bridge with the aid of a band of local anti-fascist <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Guerrillas" title="Guerrillas">guerrillas</a>. The bridge must be blown up to prevent enemy troops from traveling across it to respond to an upcoming offensive against the fascists.
</p><p>Jordan meets an old man, Anselmo, who is a guerrilla fighter who will serve as Jordan's liaison with the local guerrilla fighters. Anselmo leads Jordan to a group of Republican guerrillas who are led by a middle-aged man named Pablo. Jordan falls in love one of the guerrillas, a young woman named María. María's life was shattered by her parents' execution and her gang-rape at the hands of the <a href="/wiki/Falangism" title="Falangism">Falangists</a> (part of the fascist coalition) at the outbreak of the war. Jordan has a strong sense of duty, which clashes with the unwillingness of the guerrilla leader Pablo to commit to helping with the bridge-blowing operation, as it would endanger himself and his band. At the same time, Jordan develops a new-found lust for life which arises from his love for María. Pablo's wife Pilar displaces Pablo as the group leader and pledges the allegiance of the guerrillas to Jordan's mission. However, when another band of anti-fascist guerrillas, led by El Sordo, is surrounded and killed in a desperate <a href="/wiki/Last_stand" title="Last stand">last stand</a>, Pablo destroys Jordan's dynamite detonation equipment, hoping to prevent the bridge demolition and thereby avoid fascist reprisals on his camp. Later, Pablo regrets abandoning his comrades and returns to assist in the operation.
</p><p>However, the enemy, apprised of the coming offensive, has prepared to ambush the Republicans in force and it seems unlikely that blowing up the bridge will do much to prevent a <a href="/wiki/Rout" title="Rout">rout</a>. Regardless, Jordan understands that he must still demolish the bridge in an attempt to prevent fascist reinforcements from overwhelming his allies. Lacking the equipment destroyed by Pablo, Jordan and Anselmo improvise an alternative method to explode the dynamite by using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hand_grenade" title="Hand grenade">hand grenades</a>. Jordan attaches wires to the grenades so that their pins can be pulled from a distance. This improvised plan is considerably more dangerous than using conventional detonators, because the men must increase their proximity to the explosion.
</p><p>While the guerrilla fighters—Pablo, Pilar, and María—create a diversion for Jordan and Anselmo, the two men plant and detonate the dynamite, costing Anselmo his life when he is hit by a piece of debris from the exploding bridge. While the guerrillas are escaping on horseback, Jordan is maimed when a fascist tank shoots his horse out from under him. Jordan cannot feel his legs and he knows that if his comrades stop to rescue him, they too will be captured or killed. He bids goodbye to María and ensures that she escapes to safety with the surviving guerrillas. Armed with a <a href="/wiki/Lewis_gun" title="Lewis gun">Lewis machine gun</a>, he waits until the horse-mounted fascist soldiers appear in his gun sights. He then pulls the trigger, firing a sweeping barrage at the oncoming soldiers. The film ends with Jordan firing the Lewis gun directly at the camera.
</p><p>In World War I song-and-dance man Jerry Jones (<a href="/wiki/George_Murphy" title="George Murphy">George Murphy</a>) is drafted into the US Army, where he stages a revue called <i>Yip Yip Yaphank.</i> It is a rousing success, but one night during the show orders are received to leave immediately for France: instead of the finale, the troops march up the aisles through the audience, out the theater's main entrance and into a convoy of waiting trucks. Among the teary, last-minute goodbyes Jones kisses his newlywed bride Ethel (<a href="/wiki/Rosemary_DeCamp" title="Rosemary DeCamp">Rosemary DeCamp</a>) farewell.
</p><p>In the trenches of France, several of the soldiers in the production are killed or wounded by shrapnel from a German artillery barrage.

</p><p>The plot provides an envelope to showcase both revues.
</p><p>Father Charles “Chuck” O’Malley, an incoming priest from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/East_St._Louis" title="East St. Louis">East St. Louis</a>, arrives in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> with an unconventional style that will transform the parish life of St. Dominic's Church.
</p><p>On his first day, O'Malley gets into a series of mishaps; his informal appearance and attitude make a poor impression with the elder pastor, Father Fitzgibbon. The very traditional Fitzgibbon is further put off by O’Malley's recreational habits – particularly his golf-playing – and his friendship with the even more casual Father Timmy O’Dowd. In a discussion between O'Malley and O'Dowd without Fitzgibbon present, it is revealed that O’Malley was sent by the bishop to take charge of the affairs of the parish, but that Fitzgibbon is to remain as pastor. To spare Fitzgibbon's feelings, the older pastor is kept unaware of this arrangement and believes that O’Malley is simply his assistant.
</p><p>A series of events highlights the difference between O’Malley and Fitzgibbon's styles, as they deal with events like a parishioner being evicted and a young woman named Carol James having run away from home. The most consequential difference of opinion between O’Malley and Fitzgibbon arises in their handling of the youth of the church, many of whom are consistently getting into trouble with the law in a gang led by Tony Scaponi. Fitzgibbon is inclined to look the other way, siding with the boys because of their frequent church attendance. O’Malley seeks to make inroads into the boys’ lives, befriending Scaponi and eventually convincing the boys to become a church choir.
</p><p>The noise of the practicing choir annoys Fitzgibbon, who finally decides to go to the bishop and ask for O’Malley to be transferred away. In the course of the conversation, Fitzgibbon infers the bishop's intention to put O’Malley in charge of the parish. To avoid an uncomfortable situation, instead of making his initial request, Fitzgibbon asks the bishop to put O’Malley in charge, and then, resigned to his fate of losing control over the church, he informs O’Malley of his new role.
</p><p>A distressed Fitzgibbon then runs away, leading to a search. He returns late at night, and as O’Malley puts the older priest to bed, the two begin to bond. They discuss Fitzgibbon's long-put-off desire to go to <a href="/wiki/Ireland" title="Ireland">Ireland</a> and see his mother, whom he has not seen since he left Ireland as a young priest to come to America, and who is now over 90. O’Malley puts Fitzgibbon to sleep with an Irish lullaby, “<a href="/wiki/Too_Ra_Loo_Ra_Loo_Ral" title="Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral">Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral</a>”.
</p><p>O'Malley runs into Jenny Tuffel, an old girlfriend whom he left to join the priesthood. Jenny now has a successful career with the <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_Opera" title="Metropolitan Opera">Metropolitan Opera</a>, performing under the stage name Genevieve Linden. As she prepares to go onstage as the lead in a performance of <i><a href="/wiki/Carmen" title="Carmen">Carmen</a></i>, the two discuss their past, and she learns that her world travels with a previous opera company caused her to miss his letter explaining he had entered the priesthood.
</p><p>O'Malley next pays a visit to Carol, who is now suspected of living in sin with Ted Haines Jr., the son of the church's mortgage-holder, Ted Haines Sr. On this visit, O’Malley describes to the young couple his calling in life to “go his way,” which to him means to follow after the joyous side of religion and lead others to do the same. He performs for them the song “Going My Way,” which he wrote on this theme.
</p><p>Jenny visits O’Malley at the church, sees the boys’ choir, and reads the sheet music of “Going My Way.” She, O'Malley, and Father O’Dowd devise a plan to rent out the Metropolitan, perform “Going My Way” with the choir and a full orchestra, then sell the rights to the song, thereby saving the church from its financial woes. The plan fails, as the music executive brought on to hear the song does not believe it will sell. The choir decides to make the most of its opportunity on the grand stage, and sings another song, "<a href="/wiki/Swinging_on_a_Star" title="Swinging on a Star">Swinging on a Star</a>". The executive overhears the song and decides to buy it, providing enough money to pay off the church mortgage.
</p><p>With the church affairs in order, O’Malley and Fitzgibbon go on a golf course together. Just as everything seems to have fallen into place, though, the parish church is damaged in a massive fire. O'Malley prepares to move on to a new assignment from the bishop. He leaves O’Dowd to be Fitzgibbon's new assistant, putting Tony Scaponi in charge of the choir. On Christmas Eve, parishioners gather in a temporary church for a service that also serves as O'Malley's farewell. As a going-away present, O’Malley has sent for Fitzgibbon's mother from Ireland. As mother and son embrace for the first time in 45 years, the choir sings “Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral”, as Father O’Malley quietly slips away into the night.
</p><p><i>Mom and Dad</i> tells the story of Joan Blake (<a href="/wiki/June_Carlson" title="June Carlson">June Carlson</a>), a young girl who falls for the pilot Jack Griffin (Bob Lowell).

The girl later learns from her father Dan Blake (George Eldredge) that the pilot has died in a crash. She tears up a letter she had been writing to him, and lowers her head as the film fades into intermission.
</p><p>The film resumes at the point when the girl discovers that her clothes no longer fit, sending her into a state of despair.  She takes advice from her teacher, Carl Blackburn (Hardie Albright), who had previously been fired for teaching sex education.

One disagreement involves a student (Richard Tyler) who is being bullied by another.

The reverse psychology works, and the boys go to speak with their mother. After being spanked, they realize that Johnny had fooled them. In an act of revenge, they tell Sally about the dog. She becomes upset that Johnny and Uncle Remus kept the dog despite her order (which was unknown to Uncle Remus). She instructs Uncle Remus not to tell any more stories to her son.

With her dress ruined, Ginny is unable to go to the party and runs off crying. Johnny begins fighting with the boys, but their fight is broken up by Uncle Remus, who scolds Joe and Jake. Johnny runs off to comfort Ginny. He explains that he does not want to go either, especially since his father will not be there. Uncle Remus discovers both dejected children and cheers them up by telling the story of <a href="/wiki/The_Laughing_Place" title="The Laughing Place">Br'er Rabbit and his "Laughing Place"</a>.

</p><p>After World War II, returning veterans Fred Derry, Homer Parrish, and Al Stephenson meet while flying home to Boone City. Fred is returning from Europe as a decorated captain and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bombardier_(air_force)" title="Bombardier (air force)">bombardier</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Eighth_Air_Force#World_War_II_(1944–1945)" title="Eighth Air Force">Eighth Air Force</a>.

All three have trouble adjusting to civilian life.
</p><p>Al is a banker with a comfortable home and a loving family: wife Milly, adult daughter Peggy, and high-school student son Rob. He is promoted to Vice President in charge of small loans, as the president views his military experience as valuable in dealing with other returning servicemen. When Al approves an unsecured loan to a young Navy veteran, the president advises him against making a habit of it. Later, at a banquet in his honor, a slightly inebriated Al expounds that the bank (and America) must stand with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Veterans" title="Veterans">vets</a> and give them every chance to rebuild their lives.
</p><p>Fred, once an unskilled drugstore <a href="/wiki/Soda_jerk" title="Soda jerk">soda jerk</a>, wants something better, but the tight post-war job market forces him to return to his old job. Fred had met Marie while in flight training and married her shortly afterward, before shipping out less than a month later. She became a nightclub waitress while Fred was overseas. Marie makes it clear she does not enjoy being married to a lowly soda jerk.
</p><p>Homer was a high school football quarterback and became engaged to his next door neighbor, Wilma, before joining the Navy. Homer and his parents now have trouble dealing with his disability. He does not want to burden Wilma with his handicap so he eventually pushes her away, although she still wants to marry him.
</p><p>Peggy meets Fred when picking up her father home from a bar where the three men had re-united. They are attracted to each other. Peggy dislikes Marie, and informs her parents she intends to end Fred's marriage, but they tell her that their own marriage overcame similar problems. Concerned, Al demands that Fred stop seeing his daughter. Fred agrees, but the friendship between the two men is strained.
</p><p>When an obnoxious customer, who claims that the war was fought against the wrong enemies, gets into a fight with Homer, Fred intervenes and knocks the man down – costing him his job. Fred encourages Homer to put his misgivings behind him and marry Wilma, offering to be his best man.
</p><p>Wilma visits Homer and tells him that her parents want her to leave Boone City for an extended period to try to forget him. Homer bluntly demonstrates to her how hard life with him would be. When Wilma is undaunted, Homer reconsiders.
</p><p>Fred discovers his wife with another veteran. After complaining to Fred that she has "given up the best years of my life", Marie tells him that she is getting a divorce.

</p><p>People have gathered for the wedding of Homer and Wilma. Fred, now divorced, is Homer's best man. While the vows are exchanged, Fred and Peggy glance across at one another. At the conclusion, everyone gathers around the newlyweds. Still gazing over at Peggy, Fred walks across the room, takes her in his arms, and kisses her. He asks if she understands how things will be for them, that it could take years before they can get a life established. All the while, Peggy smiles fondly at Fred, and then kisses him again.

Before Scott Chavez is executed as a punishment for killing his wife, he arranges for his daughter Pearl to live with his second cousin and old sweetheart, Laura Belle (<a href="/wiki/Lillian_Gish" title="Lillian Gish">Lillian Gish</a>).
</p><p>Arriving by stagecoach, Pearl is met by Jesse McCanles (<a href="/wiki/Joseph_Cotten" title="Joseph Cotten">Joseph Cotten</a>), one of Laura Belle's two grown sons. He takes her to Spanish Bit, their enormous cattle ranch. The gentle and gracious Laura Belle is happy to welcome her to their home, but not so her husband, the Senator Jackson McCanles (<a href="/wiki/Lionel_Barrymore" title="Lionel Barrymore">Lionel Barrymore</a>), who uses a wheelchair. He calls Pearl "a half-breed" and jealously despises Pearl's father.
</p><p>The second son, Lewt (<a href="/wiki/Gregory_Peck" title="Gregory Peck">Gregory Peck</a>), is a ladies' man with a personality quite unlike that of his gentlemanly brother Jesse. He expresses his interest in Pearl in direct terms and she takes a strong dislike to him. Laura Belle calls in Mr. Jubal Crabbe, the "Sinkiller" (<a href="/wiki/Walter_Huston" title="Walter Huston">Walter Huston</a>), a gun-toting preacher, to counsel Pearl on how to avoid the evils of temptation. Pearl is determined to remain "a good girl."
</p><p>When she submits to Lewt's aggressive advances one night, Pearl is angry with him and ashamed of her own behavior. But she also cannot help but be flattered by his lust and attentions. Jesse, meanwhile, is ostracized by his father and no longer welcome at the ranch after siding with railroad men, headed by Mr. Langford (<a href="/wiki/Otto_Kruger" title="Otto Kruger">Otto Kruger</a>), against the Senator's personal interests. Jesse is in love with Pearl but he leaves for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Austin" title="Austin">Austin</a> to pursue a political career and becomes engaged to Helen Langford (<a href="/wiki/Joan_Tetzel" title="Joan Tetzel">Joan Tetzel</a>), Langford's daughter.
</p><p>Offended when Lewt reneges on a promise to marry her, Pearl takes up with Sam Pierce (<a href="/wiki/Charles_Bickford" title="Charles Bickford">Charles Bickford</a>), a neighboring rancher who is smitten with her. She does not love him but says yes to his proposal. Before they can be married, however, Lewt picks a fight with Pierce in a saloon and guns him down. He insists that Pearl can belong only to him.  Lewt becomes a wanted man.
</p><p>On the run from the law, Lewt finds time to derail a train and occasionally drop by the ranch late at night and press his attentions on Pearl. She cannot resist her desire for him and lies for Lewt to the law, hiding him in her room.  Afterward, however, he walks out on her, despite her pleas that she loves him.
</p><p>Laura Belle's health takes a turn for the worse and the Senator admits his love for her before she dies. Jesse returns to visit but is too late; his mother is dead. The Senator continues to shun him, as does Lewt, their family feud finally resulting in a showdown. Lewt tosses a gun to his unarmed brother but Jesse stands his ground without attempting to pick it up.  Jesse warns that Lewt will eventually be hanged as a murderer, and Lewt responds by shooting Jesse.
</p><p>The Senator's old friend, Lem Smoot (<a href="/wiki/Harry_Carey_(actor)" title="Harry Carey (actor)">Harry Carey</a>) tells him that Jesse's wound is not mortal and the old man softens up towards his son. A livid Pearl is relieved that Jesse is going to survive. When Helen arrives, she invites Pearl to leave Spanish Bit forever and come live with them in <a href="/wiki/Austin,_Texas" title="Austin, Texas">Austin</a>. Pearl agrees, but she is tipped off by one of the Spanish Bit hands, Sid (<a href="/wiki/Scott_McKay" title="Scott McKay">Scott McKay</a>) that Lewt intends to come after Jesse again. She arms herself and engages in a shootout with Lewt in the desert, where they die in each other's arms.

The carriage drives into the country where its passengers abandon a baby, named Amber, on the doorstep of a farming cottage. The roundheads soon catch up with the carriage and kill all the passengers while the farmers discover and decide to adopt Amber.
</p><p>The film moves forward to 1660; the death of <a href="/wiki/Oliver_Cromwell" title="Oliver Cromwell">Oliver Cromwell</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Restoration_(England)" title="Restoration (England)">restoration of the Monarchy</a>. The residents of London rejoice and celebrate the return of the monarchy, but the small rural towns and villages remain strictly puritanical. 
</p><p>Sixteen years after being abandoned in a small rural village, Amber (<a href="/wiki/Linda_Darnell" title="Linda Darnell">Linda Darnell</a>) has grown into a beauty and is about to be married despite her protests. She wants to be more than a farmer's wife and dreams of court fashions and a life away from the village. Her dream comes true with the arrival of a group of cavaliers and the handsome Bruce Carlton (<a href="/wiki/Cornel_Wilde" title="Cornel Wilde">Cornel Wilde</a>), with whom she becomes instantly smitten. She follows the Cavaliers to a tavern and begs Bruce to let her come with him to London. Despite her request and coaxing from Bruce's friend Almsbury (<a href="/wiki/Richard_Greene" title="Richard Greene">Richard Greene</a>), Bruce refuses her, while Almsbury also unsuccessfully tries to seduce her. Amber once again tries to convince Bruce to take her to London, which he refuses, before they share a kiss.
</p><p>Bruce and Almsbury return to London to seek an audience with the king but are turned away. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Barbara_Villiers" title="Barbara Villiers">Barbara Villiers</a>, the king's mistress, is brought to court and coldly walks past them. 
</p><p>As Bruce and Almsbury return to their London tavern, they see that Amber has followed them to London. Bruce allows her to stay with him and they begin an affair whereby Bruce pampers Amber with new gowns and takes her to the theater. At one performance, Bruce sees Barbara Villiers (Natalie Draper) alone and goes to speak with her about getting the king to grant him ships for his privateer mission. Amber is distraught at the thought of Bruce leaving and stops Almsbury from warning Bruce that the king has arrived. The king sees Bruce with his mistress and later summons him to court.
</p><p>Not wanting his friend to face the king's wrath alone, Almsbury goes with him. The king, however, grants Bruce the ships he needs and requests that he leave for Bristol that very night. Bruce and Almsbury return to the tavern to see Amber sleeping. Bruce plans on leaving before Amber wakes, and Almsbury helps him pack, despite telling Bruce that Amber loves him and it would be cruel. 
</p><p>The next morning Amber wakes up to find Almsbury packing up his belongings and returning to Almsbury Hall. Almsbury explains that the king gave him back his lands and gave Bruce his ships as Amber races into Bruce's room to see it empty. Almsbury tries to convince Amber to go back to her village but she refuses, stating that she will marry Bruce no matter what. Almsbury leaves her and gives her money from Bruce to keep her from starving.
</p><p>However Amber is quickly conned out of her money, put in debt and sent to <a href="/wiki/Newgate_Prison" title="Newgate Prison">Newgate Prison</a>. While in Newgate Prison, Amber discovers she's pregnant with Bruce's child and meets Black Jack Mallet, a highwayman, who falls in love with her and who helps her break out. The pair go to Mother Redcap's (<a href="/wiki/Anne_Revere" title="Anne Revere">Anne Revere</a>) tavern where Amber gives birth to a son. 
</p><p>Amber soon begins to make a living luring fops into alleyways where Black Jack robs them. During one of the robberies, Black Jack is killed by the king's guard and Amber flees. She hides inside a house where she is discovered by Captain Rex Morgan (<a href="/wiki/Glenn_Langan" title="Glenn Langan">Glenn Langan</a>).
</p><p>Captain Morgan gets her work as an actress to save her from being sent to <a href="/wiki/Tyburn#Tyburn_gallows" title="Tyburn">Tyburn</a> and takes her as his mistress. While Amber is working as an actress, the Earl of Radcliffe shows an interest in Amber, and Almsbury returns to London. He is now married with a child and tells Amber that Bruce will return any day now. Captain Morgan also proposes to Amber but she rejects him because she still loves Bruce. She also turns down a chance to dine with Charles II because of Bruce.
</p><p>Bruce returns and Amber introduces him to their son, hoping he will want to settle down. However he wants to return to sea. Morgan finds Bruce and Amber together and challenges Bruce to a duel, saying Amber is his fiancée. Bruce accepts though he tries to persuade Morgan to end the duel. Morgan refuses and Bruce winds up killing him. He blames Amber and rejects her, and leaves England.
</p><p>Amber decides to marry the elderly widowed Earl of Radcliffe. This will make her a countess, which she hopes will interest Bruce.

</p><p>Based on Neil Swanson's <i>Unconquered, a Novel of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pontiac_Conspiracy" title="Pontiac Conspiracy">Pontiac Conspiracy</a></i>, the film focuses on "Abby" Hale (Paulette Goddard), who is condemned to death by a British court, then offered clemency if she will become an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Indentured_servant" title="Indentured servant">indentured servant</a> in America.  There is a bidding competition between Captain Christopher Holden (Gary Cooper) and Martin Garth (<a href="/wiki/Howard_Da_Silva" title="Howard Da Silva">Howard Da Silva</a>), which Holden wins. He then sets her free.  Unfortunately, Garth is a sore loser; he kidnaps Abby and takes her to the western frontier, where he is involved in illegal arms sales to the Native Americans.  Soon, Holden becomes involved in the conflict with the warring tribes and is reunited with Abby; he also has further confrontations with Garth and his henchman (Mike Mazurki).
</p><p>In 1912, <a href="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> star Don Hewes (Fred Astaire) is buying Easter presents for his sweetheart ("Happy Easter").  At one store, he must persuade a young boy to part with a cuddly Easter rabbit he wants and choose a set of drums ("Drum Crazy") instead. He takes the gifts to his dancing partner, Nadine Hale (<a href="/wiki/Ann_Miller" title="Ann Miller">Ann Miller</a>), who explains that she has been offered a show that would feature her as a solo star. He tries to get her to change her mind and it looks as if he has succeeded ("It Only Happens When I Dance With You"), until his best friend, Johnny (<a href="/wiki/Peter_Lawford" title="Peter Lawford">Peter Lawford</a>), arrives. She reveals that she and Don are no longer a team and makes it obvious that she is attracted to Johnny. She continues to pursue him, but he refuses her out of respect for Don.
</p><p>Don drowns his sorrow at a bar, where he brags that he can make a star of the next dancer he meets. He picks one of the girls performing on stage, Hannah Brown (<a href="/wiki/Judy_Garland" title="Judy Garland">Judy Garland</a>), and tells her to meet him for rehearsal the next day. He tries to turn her into a copy of Nadine, teaching her to dance the same way, buying her dresses in a similar style and giving her an "exotic" stage name, "Juanita". However, she makes several mistakes at their first performance ("Beautiful Faces Need Beautiful Clothes"), and the show is a fiasco.
</p><p>Hannah meets Johnny, who is instantly attracted to her and sings "A Fella With an Umbrella" while walking her to her rehearsal with Don. After he tries - unsuccessfully - to reunite Nadine and Don by inviting them to lunch and then leaving them alone, she tells him her friends are laughing because Hannah is trying to be her. He realizes his mistake and after hearing Hannah sing "I Love a Piano", he works out routines more suited to her personality. Now known as "Hannah &amp; Hewes", they are shown much more successfully performing "I Love a Piano," "Snookie-Ookums", "The Ragtime Violin", and "When That Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves For Alabam'".
</p><p>At an audition for <a href="/wiki/Ziegfeld_Follies" title="Ziegfeld Follies">Ziegfeld Follies</a>, Hannah and Don meet Nadine, who will star in the show. Hannah realizes that Nadine was Don's former dancing partner and demands to know if they were in love. Later, Don meets Hannah back at the hotel and reveals that he turned down the Ziegfeld offer, believing that she and Nadine do not belong in the same show. Johnny arrives to take Hannah to dinner, at which he reveals that he has fallen in love with her. While she does like him, she admits she is actually in love with Don. They continue to have a close friendship.
</p><p>Nadine's show opens ("Shakin' The Blues Away") and Don is in the audience. When he and Hannah meet the next day, he reveals he signed them to star in their own show and invites her to celebrate over dinner. She arrives at his apartment, only to have him suggest a dance rehearsal. She is upset and tells him that he doesn't see her as a woman, only a dancing aid. She tries to leave, but he stops and kisses her. She then plays the piano and sings "It Only Happens When I Dance With You," after which he realizes he is in love with her and they embrace.
</p><p>The show contains a solo by Don ("<a href="/wiki/Steppin%27_Out_with_My_Baby" title="Steppin' Out with My Baby">Steppin' Out with My Baby</a>"), followed by the best-known musical number in the film ("<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/We%27re_a_Couple_of_Swells" title="We're a Couple of Swells">We're a Couple of Swells</a>"), in which he and Hannah play a pair of street urchins with vivid imaginations. They go to celebrate after the show at the roof garden where Nadine is performing.  The audience gives them a rousing ovation as they arrive, much to Nadine's chagrin who hears the uproar backstage. After she dances in a number called "The Girl on the Magazine Cover," she insists that Don perform one of their old numbers with her for old times' sake - "It Only Happens When I Dance With You (Reprise)". When he reluctantly agrees, Hannah becomes upset and leaves, believing that he has only been using her to regain Nadine, and has succeeded.
</p><p>Hannah goes to the bar where she and Don first met. She pours out her troubles to Mike the bartender ("Better Luck Next Time"). When she returns to her apartment, she finds Don waiting. He tries to explain that he was forced to dance with Nadine and says he'll wait all night for her to forgive him, but just before she opens the door, he is evicted by the house detective. The next morning Hannah tells Johnny about her and Don's misunderstanding. He says if he loved someone he would let her know it. She realizes that he is right and goes to meet Don for their date at the <a href="/wiki/Easter_parade" title="Easter parade">Easter parade</a>.
</p><p>Later that morning, several gifts arrive at Don's apartment, with no cards. Hannah arrives unexpectedly saying she sent them, oblivious to the previous evening's argument and urging him to prepare for their date. As they walk in the Easter parade, photographers take their picture, echoing the film's opening with Nadine, and he proposes to her (<a href="/wiki/Easter_Parade_(song)" title="Easter Parade (song)">"Easter Parade"</a>).
</p><p>At a performance by the Ballet Lermontov at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Covent_Garden_Opera_House" title="Covent Garden Opera House">Covent Garden Opera House</a>, music student Julian is in attendance to hear the ballet score <i>Heart of Fire</i>, composed by his teacher, Professor Palmer. Separately present is Victoria 'Vicky' Page, a young, unknown dancer from an aristocratic background, with her aunt, Lady Neston. As <i>Heart of Fire</i> progresses, Julian recognises the music as one of his own compositions.
</p><p>During the performance, Professor Palmer receives an invitation to an after-ballet party at Lady Neston's residence, also asking Boris Lermontov, the company impresario, to attend. Julian leaves the performance in disillusionment at his professor's plagiarism of his music. Lermontov and Vicki meet, and he invites her to a rehearsal of the company.
</p><p>Julian has written to Lermontov to explain the circumstances behind <i>Heart of Fire</i>, but then tries to retrieve the letter. Lermontov's assistant Dimitri thwarts all attempts by Julian to gain entry to Lermontov's suite, but finally Lermontov gives Julian an audience. Julian says that he wishes to retrieve his letter before Lermontov has seen it, except that Lermontov has already read the letter.
</p><p>Lermontov asks Julian to play one of his own works at the piano. After hearing Julian play, he hires him as a <a href="/wiki/R%C3%A9p%C3%A9titeur" title="Répétiteur">répétiteur</a> for the company orchestra and assistant to the company's conductor, Livingstone Montague (known colloquially to the company as 'Livy'). Lermontov realises that Julian was the true composer of <i>Heart of Fire</i>.
</p><p>Julian and Vicky arrive for work at the Ballet Lermontov on the same day. Later, Vicky dances with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ballet_Rambert" title="Ballet Rambert">Ballet Rambert</a> in a matinee performance of <i><a href="/wiki/Swan_Lake" title="Swan Lake">Swan Lake</a></i> at the <a href="/wiki/Mercury_Theatre,_Notting_Hill_Gate" title="Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate">Mercury Theatre, Notting Hill Gate</a>, in a production with a company led by <a href="/wiki/Marie_Rambert" title="Marie Rambert">Marie Rambert</a> (who appears in the film as herself in a wordless cameo). Watching this performance, Lermontov realises her potential and invites Vicky to go with Ballet Lermontov to Paris and <a href="/wiki/Monte_Carlo" title="Monte Carlo">Monte Carlo</a>. He decides to create a starring role for her in a new ballet, <i>The Red Shoes</i>, for which Julian is to provide the music. 
</p><p><i>The Red Shoes</i> ballet is a resounding success and Lermontov revitalizes the company's repertoire with Vicky in the lead roles and Julian tasked with composing new scores. In the meantime, Vicky and Julian have fallen in love, but keep their relationship secret from Lermontov. Lermontov begins to have personal feelings toward Vicky; he resents the romance between her and Julian after learning of it. The impresario fires Julian; Vicky leaves the company with him. They marry and live in London, where Julian works on composing a new opera.
</p><p>Some time later whilst travelling, Vicky receives a visit from Lermontov, who convinces her to return to the company to dance a revival of <i>The Red Shoes</i>. On opening night, Julian appears in her dressing room; he has left the première of his opera at <a href="/wiki/Royal_Opera_House" title="Royal Opera House">Covent Garden</a> to find her and take her back. Lermontov arrives; he and Julian contend for Vicky's affections, each one arguing that her true destiny is with him only. Torn between her love for Julian and her need to dance, she eventually chooses the latter.
</p><p>Julian, realising that he has lost her, leaves for the railway station; Lermontov consoles Vicky and tries to turn her attention to the evening's performance. Vicky is escorted to the stage wearing the red shoes and, seemingly under their influence, turns and runs from the theatre. Julian, on the platform of the railway station, runs towards her. Vicky jumps from a balcony and falls in front of an approaching train.
</p><p>When Vicki jumps, she is wearing the red shoes which we saw her wearing as she is preparing in her dressing room, despite the fact that in the performance her character does not put them on until part way through the ballet. Powell and Pressburger themselves discussed this situation <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-ALIM_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-ALIM-6">[6]</a></sup> and it has been much discussed since. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-7"><a href="#cite_note-7">[7]</a></sup> Powell decided that it was artistically "right" for Vicky to be wearing the red shoes at that point because if she is not wearing them, it takes away the ambiguity over why she died. <sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-ALIM_6-1"><a href="#cite_note-ALIM-6">[6]</a></sup>
</p><p>Shaken, Lermontov appears before the audience to announce that, "Miss Page is unable to dance tonight – nor indeed any other night". As a mark of respect, the company performs <i>The Red Shoes</i> with a spotlight on the empty space where Vicky would have been.
</p><p>While lying close to death on a stretcher, Vicky asks Julian to remove the red shoes, just as at the end of <i>The Red Shoes</i> ballet.
</p><p>Virginia Cunningham (Olivia de Havilland) is an apparently schizophrenic inmate at a mental institution called the Juniper Hill State Hospital (which treats only female patients). She <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Auditory_hallucinations" title="Auditory hallucinations">hears voices</a> and seems so <a href="/wiki/Psychosis" title="Psychosis">out of touch with reality</a> that she doesn’t recognize her husband Robert (Mark Stevens).
</p><p>Dr. Kik (Leo Genn; as Mark Van <i>K</i>ensdelaer<i>ik</i>, MD/"Dr. Kik") works with her, and flashbacks show how Virginia and Robert met a few years earlier in Chicago. He worked for a publisher who rejected her writing, and they bumped into each other again in the cafeteria. Occasionally she continued to drop by the cafeteria so they get to know each other.
</p><p>Despite their blossoming romance, Virginia abruptly leaves town without explanation. Robert moves to New York and bumps into her again at the Philharmonic. After she provides a flimsy excuse for her absence and departure, they pick up where they left off, though she remains evasive and avoids his desire for marriage. Eventually, Virginia brings up the possibility of marriage. They marry on May 7, but Virginia acts erratically again. She can’t sleep and loses touch with reality, as she feels it is November and snaps when Robert corrects her. The rest of the film follows her therapy. Dr. Kik puts her through <a href="/wiki/Electroconvulsive_therapy" title="Electroconvulsive therapy">electro-shock treatment</a> and other forms of treatment including <a href="/wiki/Hypnotherapy" title="Hypnotherapy">hypnotherapy</a>. Dr. Kik wants to get to the "causes of her unconscious rejection."  The film includes many flashbacks, including her earlier failed engagement to Gordon (<a href="/wiki/Leif_Erickson_(actor)" title="Leif Erickson (actor)">Leif Erickson</a>) as well as childhood issues. The film shows her progress and what happens to her along the way.
</p><p>The mental hospital is organized on a spectrum of "levels." The better a patient gets, the lower level she is able to achieve. Virginia moves to the lowest level (One), where she encounters Nurse Davis (Helen Craig), the only truly abusive nurse in the hospital. Davis is jealous of Dr. Kik's interest in Virginia, which she sees as excessive. Nurse Davis goads Virginia into an outburst which results in Virginia being <a href="/wiki/Straitjacket" title="Straitjacket">straitjacketed</a> and expelled from Level One into the "snake pit," where patients considered beyond help are simply placed together in a large padded cell and abandoned. Dr. Kik, learning of this, has Virginia returned to Level One, but away from Nurse Davis's care.
</p><p>Despite this setback, Dr. Kik's care continues to improve Virginia's mental state. Over time, Virginia gains insight and self-understanding, and is able to leave the hospital.
</p><p>The film also depicts the bureaucratic regimentation of the institution, the staff — some unkind and aloof, some kind and empathetic; and relationships between patients, from which Virginia learns as much as she does in therapy.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Samson" title="Samson">Samson</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Tribe_of_Dan" title="Tribe of Dan">Danite</a> Hebrew placed under <a href="/wiki/Nazirite" title="Nazirite">Nazirite</a> vows from birth by his mother <a href="/wiki/Hazelelponi" title="Hazelelponi">Hazelelponit</a>, is engaged to a <a href="/wiki/Philistines" title="Philistines">Philistine</a> woman named Semadar. At their wedding feast, Samson loses a bet with his wedding guests because of Semadar and attacks 30 Philistines to strip them of their cloaks to pay his betting debt. After paying his debt, Samson searches for Semadar, only to learn that her father Tubal married her to a Philistine once Samson left the wedding to pay his debt. A fight breaks out between Samson and the Philistines, which results in the death of Semadar and Tubal. Samson becomes a hunted man, and in his fury he begins fighting the Philistines. The Saran of Gaza imposes heavy taxes on the Danites, with the purpose of having Samson betrayed by his own people. The Saran's plan works, and frustrated Danites hand over Samson to the Philistines, much to the joy of <a href="/wiki/Delilah" title="Delilah">Delilah</a>, Semadar's younger sister. Samson is taken by Prince Ahtur, the military governor of the land of Dan, and a regiment of Philistine troops. En route back to Gaza, Ahtur decides to taunt Samson. Samson rips apart his chains and ropes and begins to combat the Philistines, toppling Ahtur's war chariot and using the jawbone of an ass to club the Philistine soldiers to death.
</p><p>News of the defeat of Ahtur at the hands of Samson reaches the Saran. The Saran ponders how to defeat Samson. Delilah comes up with the idea of seducing Samson, thus having him reveal the secret of his strength and then deliver him for punishment. Her plan works; she cuts his hair, which he feels gives him his strength. To fully neutralize him, Samson is blinded by his captors and put to slave work, and is eventually brought to the temple of <a href="/wiki/Dagon" title="Dagon">Dagon</a> for the entertainment of the Philistines and the Saran. However, Delilah has been in love with Samson ever since his engagement with Semadar, and his blindness and torture make her feel deep remorse over her betrayal. She initially had betrayed him because she wanted to avenge the deaths of her father and sister, which she thought were caused "because of Samson."
</p><p>Delilah later attends the public torture of Samson wielding a whip which he uses to be guided by her to the temple of Dagon's main support pillars. Once he stands between them, he tells Delilah to flee, but she remains, unseen by him, as he pushes the pillars apart. The pillars give way and the temple collapses, burying Samson, Delilah, and all the Philistines inside alive, including the court. In the end, the temple lies in rubble, and Saul and Miriam, his two closest Danite Hebrew friends, are left to mourn Samson's passing.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Cinderella_(Disney_character)" title="Cinderella (Disney character)">Cinderella</a> is living a dissatisfying life, having lost both parents at a young age, and being forced to work as a scullery maid in her own <a href="/wiki/Ch%C3%A2teau" title="Château">château</a>. Her stepmother, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lady_Tremaine" title="Lady Tremaine">Lady Tremaine</a>, is cruel to her, and she is jealous of Cinderella's beauty. Additionally her two stepsisters <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Drizella_Tremaine" title="Drizella Tremaine">Drizella</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anastasia_Tremaine" title="Anastasia Tremaine">Anastasia</a>, cruelly take advantage of her. In spite of this, Cinderella is a kind and gentle young woman. She is friends with mice and kind to birds that live in and around the château. Meanwhile, at the royal palace, the King is frustrated that his son, the Prince, still refuses to marry. He and the Grand Duke organize a ball in an effort to find a suitable wife for the Prince, requesting every eligible maiden attend. Upon receiving notice of the ball, Lady Tremaine agrees to let Cinderella go if she finishes her chores and can find a suitable dress to wear.
</p><p>Cinderella finds a gown that belonged to her mother and decides to refashion it for the ball, but her stepfamily impedes this by giving her extra chores. Cinderella's animal friends, including <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jaq_and_Gus" title="Jaq and Gus">Jaq and Gus</a>, refashion it for her, completing the design with a necklace and sash discarded by Drizella and Anastasia, respectively. When Cinderella comes downstairs wearing the dress, the stepsisters are upset when they realize Cinderella is wearing their accessories, and tear the dress to shreds before leaving for the ball with their mother. Heartbroken, Cinderella storms out into the garden in tears, where her <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fairy_Godmother_(Disney)" title="Fairy Godmother (Disney)">Fairy Godmother</a> appears before her. Insisting that Cinderella will go to the ball, the Fairy Godmother magically transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, the mice into horses, Cinderella's horse, Major, into a coachman, and dog, Bruno, into a footman, before turning Cinderella's ruined dress into a shimmering blue ballgown and her shoes into glass slippers. As Cinderella leaves for the ball, the Fairy Godmother warns her the spell will break at the stroke of midnight.
</p><p>At the ball, the Prince rejects every girl until he sees Cinderella, who agrees to dance with him, unaware of who he is. The two fall in love and go out for a stroll together in the castle gardens. As they are about to kiss, Cinderella hears the clock start to chime midnight and flees. As she leaves the castle, one of her slippers falls off. The palace guards give chase as Cinderella flees in the coach before the spell breaks on the last stroke of midnight. Cinderella, her pets, and the mice hide in a wooded area as the guards pass.
</p><p>The Grand Duke informs the King that Cinderella, who remains anonymous, has escaped, and that the Prince wishes to marry her. The lost glass slipper is the only piece of evidence. The King issues a royal proclamation ordering every maiden in the kingdom to try on the slipper for size in an effort to find the girl. After this news reaches Cinderella's household, Lady Tremaine overhears Cinderella humming the waltz played at the ball. Realizing that Cinderella is the mysterious girl, Lady Tremaine locks her in her attic bedroom. Later, the Duke arrives at the château, and Jaq and Gus steal the key from Lady Tremaine's dress pocket and take it up to the attic as Anastasia and Drizella unsuccessfully try on the slipper. Lady Tremaine's cat, Lucifer, ambushes the mice, but Bruno chases him out of the house, allowing the mice to free Cinderella. As the Duke is about to leave, Cinderella appears and asks to try on the slipper. Knowing it will fit, Lady Tremaine trips the footman as he brings the Duke the slipper, causing it to shatter on the floor. Much to her horror, and the Grand Duke's profound relief, Cinderella presents the Duke with the other slipper, which fits perfectly. The film ends with a now-married Prince and Cinderella at their wedding, sharing a kiss as they leave.

Allan has no use for women on a safari, but during the long and grueling journey, he and  Elizabeth begin to fall in love.
</p><p>The party encounters Van Brun (<a href="/wiki/Hugo_Haas" title="Hugo Haas">Hugo Haas</a>), a lone white man living with a tribe. They learn that he met Curtis. However, when Allan recognizes him as a fugitive who cannot afford to let them go, they take him hostage to leave the village safely. Van Brun tries to shoot Allan, killing his faithful right-hand man Khiva (Kimursi), instead. Allan dispatches Van Brun and the party flees from the angry villagers.
</p><p>When they finally reach the region where the mines are supposed to be, they are met by people who resemble Umbopa. They discover that their companion is royalty; he has returned to attempt to dethrone the evil King Twala (Baziga). Umbopa leaves with his supporters, while Allan, Elizabeth and John travel to a tense meeting with Twala. With his last rifle bullet, John kills a would-be attacker, temporarily quelling the natives.
</p><p>The king's advisor, Gagool (Sekaryongo), communicates that they have seen Curtis and leads them to a cave that contains a trove of jewels and in which they find the skeletal remains of Elizabeth's husband. While they are distracted by this discovery, Gagool sneaks away and triggers a booby trap that seals them inside the cave. Leaving the jewels behind, they find a way out through an underground stream and return to the settlement, just as Umbopa and his followers arrive.
</p><p>Umbopa's people have an unusual method of deciding the kingship. The two claimants duel to the death. Despite cheating by one of Twala's men, Umbopa wins. Afterwards, he provides an escort for his friends' return trip.
</p><p>The story, set in <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">ancient Rome</a> during the final years of Emperor <a href="/wiki/Nero" title="Nero">Nero</a>'s reign, 64–68 AD, combines both historical and fictional events and characters, and compresses the key events of that period into the space of only a few weeks. Its main theme is the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Roman Empire</a>’s conflict with <a href="/wiki/Christianity" title="Christianity">Christianity</a> and persecution of Christians in the final years of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Julio-Claudian" title="Julio-Claudian">Julio-Claudian</a> line. Unlike his illustrious and powerful predecessor, Emperor <a href="/wiki/Claudius" title="Claudius">Claudius</a>, Nero proved corrupt and destructive, and his actions eventually threatened to destroy Rome's previously peaceful social order. 
</p><p>Marcus Vinicius (<a href="/wiki/Robert_Taylor_(actor)" title="Robert Taylor (actor)">Robert Taylor</a>) is a Roman military commander and the <a href="/wiki/Legatus" title="Legatus">legate</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Legio_XIV_Gemina" title="Legio XIV Gemina">XIV Gemina</a>. Returning from wars in Britain and Gaul, he falls in love with Lygia (<a href="/wiki/Deborah_Kerr" title="Deborah Kerr">Deborah Kerr</a>), a devout Christian, and as a result he finds himself increasingly drawn to her religion. Though she grew up as the foster daughter of <a href="/wiki/Aulus_Plautius" title="Aulus Plautius">Aulus Plautius</a> (<a href="/wiki/Felix_Aylmer" title="Felix Aylmer">Felix Aylmer</a>), a retired Roman general, Lygia is legally a hostage of Rome. <a href="/wiki/Petronius" title="Petronius">Petronius</a> (<a href="/wiki/Leo_Genn" title="Leo Genn">Leo Genn</a>), Marcus' uncle, persuades Nero (<a href="/wiki/Peter_Ustinov" title="Peter Ustinov">Peter Ustinov</a>) to give her to his nephew as a reward for  his services. Lygia resents this arrangement, but cannot resist falling in love with Marcus.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Nero's atrocities become increasingly outrageous and his behavior more irrational. After Nero <a href="/wiki/Great_Fire_of_Rome" title="Great Fire of Rome">burns Rome</a> and blames the Christians, Marcus sets out to rescue Lygia and her family. Nero arrests them, along with all the  other Christians, and condemns them to be slaughtered in his Circus: some are killed by lions. Petronius, Nero's most trusted advisor, warns him that the Christians will be celebrated as martyrs, but he cannot change the emperor's mind. Then, tired of Nero's insanity and suspecting that he may be about to turn on him too, Petronius composes a letter to Nero expressing his derision for the emperor (which he previously had concealed to avoid being murdered by him) and commits suicide by severing an artery in his wrist. The Christian apostle <a href="/wiki/Saint_Peter" title="Saint Peter">Peter</a> (<a href="/wiki/Finlay_Currie" title="Finlay Currie">Finlay Currie</a>) has also been arrested after returning to Rome in response to a sign from the Lord, and he marries Marcus and Lygia in the Circus prisons. Peter is later <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cross_of_St._Peter" title="Cross of St. Peter">crucified upside-down</a>, a form of execution conceived by Nero's Praetorian Guard as an expression of mockery.
</p><p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Poppaea" title="Poppaea">Poppaea</a> (<a href="/wiki/Patricia_Laffan" title="Patricia Laffan">Patricia Laffan</a>), Nero's wife, who lusts after Marcus, devises a diabolical revenge for his rejection of her. Lygia is tied to a stake in the Circus and a wild bull is released into the arena. Lygia's bodyguard Ursus (<a href="/wiki/Buddy_Baer" title="Buddy Baer">Buddy Baer</a>) must attempt to kill the bull with his bare hands to save Lygia from being gored to death. Marcus is taken to the emperor's box and forced to watch, to the outrage of his officers, who are among the spectators. But Ursus is able to topple the bull and break its neck. Massively impressed by Ursus's victory, the crowd exhorts Nero to spare the couple. He refuses to do so, even after four of his courtiers, <a href="/wiki/Seneca_the_Younger" title="Seneca the Younger">Seneca</a> (<a href="/wiki/Nicholas_Hannen_(actor)" title="Nicholas Hannen (actor)">Nicholas Hannen</a>), architect <a href="/wiki/Phaon_(freedman)" title="Phaon (freedman)">Phaon</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/D.A._Clarke-Smith" title="D.A. Clarke-Smith">D.A. Clarke-Smith</a>), poet <a href="/wiki/Lucan" title="Lucan">Lucan</a> (Alfredo Varelli), and musician Terpnos (Geoffrey Dunn) add their endorsement of the mob's demands by putting their thumbs up as well. Marcus then breaks free of his bonds, leaps into the arena, and frees Lygia with the help of the loyal troops from his own legion. Marcus accuses Nero of burning Rome and announces that General <a href="/wiki/Galba" title="Galba">Galba</a> is at that moment marching on the city, intent on replacing Nero, and hails him as new Emperor of Rome.
</p><p>The crowd revolts, now firmly believing that Nero, not the Christians, is responsible for the burning of Rome. Nero flees to his palace, where he strangles Poppaea, blaming her for inciting him to <a href="/wiki/Scapegoat" title="Scapegoat">scapegoat</a> the Christians. Then <a href="/wiki/Claudia_Acte" title="Claudia Acte">Acte</a> (<a href="/wiki/Rosalie_Crutchley" title="Rosalie Crutchley">Rosalie Crutchley</a>), Nero's discarded mistress who is still in love with him, appears and offers him a dagger to end his own life before the mob storming the palace kills him. Nero cannot do it, so Acte helps him to push the dagger into his chest, and he dies.
</p><p>Marcus, Lygia and Ursus are now free, and they leave Rome for Marcus' estate in Sicily. By the roadside, Peter's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crozier" title="Crozier">crook</a>, which he had left behind when he returned to Rome, has sprouted blossoms. A radiant light appears and a chorus intones, "I am the way, the truth, and the life," words reported to have been spoken by Jesus (<a href="/wiki/Gospel_of_John" title="Gospel of John">John</a> 14:6, <a href="/wiki/New_Testament" title="New Testament">New Testament</a>).

</p><p>In <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/London,_England" title="London, England">London</a>, circa 1900, George and Mary Darling's preparations to attend a party are disrupted by the antics of their boys, John and Michael, acting out a story about Peter Pan and the pirates, told to them by their older sister, <a href="/wiki/Wendy_Darling" title="Wendy Darling">Wendy</a>. George, who is fed up with the stories that have made his children less practical, angrily declares that Wendy has gotten too old to continue staying in the nursery with them. That night, they are visited in the nursery by <a href="/wiki/Peter_Pan" title="Peter Pan">Peter Pan</a> himself, who teaches them to fly with the help of his pixie friend, <a href="/wiki/Tinker_Bell" title="Tinker Bell">Tinker Bell</a>, and takes them with him to the island of Never Land.
</p><p>A ship of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pirates" title="Pirates">pirates</a> is anchored off Never Land, commanded by <a href="/wiki/Captain_Hook" title="Captain Hook">Captain Hook</a> with his sidekick, <a href="/wiki/Mr._Smee" title="Mr. Smee">Mr. Smee</a>. Hook boldly plots to take revenge upon Peter Pan for cutting off his hand, but trembles at the presence of a crocodile, which consumed Hook's hand and is eager to taste the rest of him. The crew's restlessness is interrupted by the arrival of Peter and the Darlings. Tinker Bell, who is very jealous of Pan's attention to Wendy, persuades the <a href="/wiki/Lost_Boys_(Peter_Pan)" title="Lost Boys (Peter Pan)">Lost Boys</a> that Pan has ordered them to shoot down Wendy, which Tink refers to as a "Wendy bird". Tinker Bell's treachery is soon found out, and Peter <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Banishment" title="Banishment">banishes</a> her. John and Michael set off with the Lost Boys to find the island's <a href="/wiki/Indigenous_peoples" title="Indigenous peoples">Indians</a>, who instead capture them, believing them to be the ones responsible for taking the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Leader" title="Leader">chief</a>'s daughter, <a href="/wiki/Tiger_Lily_(Peter_Pan)" title="Tiger Lily (Peter Pan)">Tiger Lily</a>.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Peter takes Wendy to see the <a href="/wiki/Mermaid" title="Mermaid">mermaids</a>. The mischievous mermaids delight in tormenting Wendy, but flee in terror at the sight of Hook. Peter and Wendy see that Hook and Smee have captured Tiger Lily so that they might persuade her to disclose Peter's hideout. Peter and Wendy free her, and Peter is honored by the tribe. Hook then plots to take advantage of Tinker Bell's jealousy of Wendy, tricking her into revealing the location of Peter's lair. Wendy and her brothers eventually grow homesick and plan to return home. They invite Peter and the Lost Boys to return to London and be adopted by the Darling parents. The Lost Boys agree, but Peter is so set against growing up that he refuses, presumptuously thinking that they will all return shortly. The pirates lie in wait and capture the Lost Boys and the Darlings as they exit, leaving behind a <a href="/wiki/Time_bomb" title="Time bomb">time bomb</a> to kill Peter. Tinker Bell learns of the plot just in time to snatch the bomb from Peter as it explodes.

Peter engages Hook in single combat as the children fight off the crew, and succeeds in humiliating the captain. Hook and his crew flee, with the crocodile in hot pursuit. Peter gallantly commandeers the deserted ship, and assisted by Tinker Bell's pixie dust, flies it to London with the children aboard. However, the Lost Boys decide to return to Never Land rather than be adopted in London. George and Mary Darling return home from the party to find Wendy not in her bed, but sleeping at the open window. Wendy awakens and excitedly tells about their adventures. The parents look out the window and see what appears to be a pirate ship in the clouds. George, who has softened his position about Wendy staying in the nursery, recognizes the ship from his own childhood.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Rome" title="Ancient Rome">Ancient Rome</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Iudaea_Province" title="Iudaea Province">Judaea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Capri" title="Capri">Capri</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Galilee" title="Galilee">Galilee</a> (in the time period stretching from 32 to 38 AD.), Diana (<a href="/wiki/Jean_Simmons" title="Jean Simmons">Jean Simmons</a>) tells Emperor Caligula that she has not heard from Marcellus Gallio (<a href="/wiki/Richard_Burton" title="Richard Burton">Richard Burton</a>) for almost a year, when Marcellus was in Cana of Galilee. At that time, Marcellus was told by Paulus that Caligula had become the emperor.
</p><p>Marcellus Gallio, son of an important Roman senator (<a href="/wiki/Torin_Thatcher" title="Torin Thatcher">Torin Thatcher</a>), and himself a <a href="/wiki/Military_tribune" title="Military tribune">military tribune</a>, introduces through flashback narration, the might and scope of the Roman empire. Marcellus is notoriously known as a ladies’ man, but is captivated by the reappearance of his childhood sweetheart, Diana, ward of the Emperor Tiberius. Diana is unofficially pledged in marriage to Tiberius's regent, Caligula.
</p><p>In a slave market Marcellus bids against Caligula for a defiant Greek slave, Demetrius (<a href="/wiki/Victor_Mature" title="Victor Mature">Victor Mature</a>), and wins. Angrily, Caligula issues orders for Marcellus to receive a military transfer to <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a> in <a href="/wiki/Palestine_(region)" title="Palestine (region)">Palestine</a>.
</p><p>Marcellus has Demetrius released and orders him to go on his own to the Gallio home. Marcellus is surprised to find Demetrius waiting for him when he arrives. Unofficially, Marcellus had freed Demetrius, but Demetrius feels honor bound to compensate Marcellus by being his servant. Demetrius accompanies Marcellus to Palestine but, before the <a href="/wiki/Galley" title="Galley">galley</a> sails, Diana comes to see Marcellus, pledging her love for him and her intention to intercede on his behalf with Tiberius. Marcellus declares his love for Diana and asks her to make the emperor promise not to give her in marriage to Caligula.
</p><p>Marcellus rides into Jerusalem with the <a href="/wiki/Centurion" title="Centurion">centurion</a> Paulus (<a href="/wiki/Jeff_Morrow" title="Jeff Morrow">Jeff Morrow</a>) on the same day as Jesus's triumphal entry on <a href="/wiki/Palm_Sunday" title="Palm Sunday">Palm Sunday</a>. Demetrius locks eyes with Jesus and feels compelled to follow him.
</p><p>Jesus is arrested and condemned by <a href="/wiki/Pontius_Pilate" title="Pontius Pilate">Pontius Pilate</a> (<a href="/wiki/Richard_Boone" title="Richard Boone">Richard Boone</a>), the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Procurator_(Roman)" title="Procurator (Roman)">procurator</a>. Marcellus reports to Pilate, who informs him that the emperor has sent for him. Before Marcellus departs, he is ordered to take charge of the detail of Roman soldiers assigned to crucify Jesus. Marcellus wins the robe worn by Jesus in a dice game and is told it will be a reminder of Marcellus's first crucifixion.
</p><p>Returning from the crucifixion with Demetrius, Marcellus uses the robe in an attempt to shield himself from a rain squall, but feels a sudden crushing guilt for crucifying Jesus and tears the robe off. In a fit of rage, Demetrius curses Marcellus and the Roman Empire and runs away, taking the robe with him. Marcellus now behaves like a madman haunted by nightmares of the crucifixion. He reports to Emperor Tiberius at <a href="/wiki/Capri" title="Capri">Capri</a>, who gives him an imperial commission to find and destroy the robe, while gathering a list of names of Jesus' followers. At Diana's request, Tiberius leaves her free to marry Marcellus, though Tiberius believes Marcellus is mad.
</p><p>Marcellus travels to Palestine, seeking to ingratiate himself with Justus (<a href="/wiki/Dean_Jagger" title="Dean Jagger">Dean Jagger</a>), a weaver in Cana, and the Christian community that he leads. He sees examples of Christian life in Justus's miraculously healed grandson and in the paralytic Miriam.
</p><p>Marcellus finds Demetrius alone in an inn and demands that he destroy the robe, believing it has cursed him into madness. Demetrius tells him the robe has no real power, that it only reminds Marcellus of what he did, and it is his guilt over the killing of an innocent man that has caused him to become so troubled.
</p><p>Demetrius gives the robe to Marcellus, who refuses to touch it. He is terrified, but as the robe touches him, he is relieved from the burden and becomes a Christian.
</p><p>Justus calls the villagers together and begins to introduce <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Simon_Peter" title="Simon Peter">Peter</a>, when he is killed by an arrow from a detachment of Roman soldiers. Marcellus intervenes and Paulus informs him that his orders are no longer valid; Tiberius is dead, and Caligula is emperor. Marcellus informs Paulus that an imperial commission is valid until specifically countermanded by the new emperor. Paulus tells Marcellus to make him obey via a sword duel. After a prolonged struggle, Marcellus prevails. Rather than killing Paulus, Marcellus hurls his sword into a tree. Paulus, humiliated by his defeat, orders the soldiers to leave.
</p><p>Peter invites Marcellus to join Demetrius and him as missionaries. Marcellus hesitates, out of guilt; but when Peter tells him of his own denial of Jesus, Marcellus confesses his role in Jesus' death. Peter points out to him that Jesus forgave him from the cross, and Marcellus pledges his life to Jesus and agrees to go with them. Their missionary journey takes them to Rome, where they must proceed "under cover" as Caligula has proscribed them.
</p><p>From Rome, Caligula summons Diana from her retreat at the Gallio home, to tell her that Marcellus has become a traitor to Rome by becoming a Christian. He takes her to the guard room where a captured Demetrius is being tortured. Diana runs out of the palace to Marcipor (<a class="new" href="/w/index.php?title=David_Leonard_(actor)&amp;action=edit&amp;redlink=1" title="David Leonard (actor) (page does not exist)">David Leonard</a>), the Gallio family slave, who is secretly Christian. Diana guesses that he is a Christian and has seen Marcellus, and so she gets Marcipor to take her to see him.
</p><p>Marcellus and Diana are reunited, and Marcellus tells her the story of the robe and his Christian conversion. Diana helps Marcellus rescue Demetrius.
</p><p>Peter comes to Gallio, where Demetrius has been taken, and heals him. Caligula issues orders to bring Marcellus to him alive to stand trial by the end of the day.
</p><p>After witnessing Peter's healing of Demetrius, the physician attending Demetrius goes to denounce them to the authorities. Marcellus' father disowns him as an enemy of Rome. Marcellus flees with Demetrius, but when Marcellus gives himself up so that Demetrius can escape, he is captured and put on trial.
</p><p>Caligula makes Diana sit next to him for Marcellus's trial. Marcellus admits to being a Christian; however, he denies the charge that Christians are plotting against the state. Marcellus tries to show Caligula his opportunity to accept Christ as he tries to hand the robe to Caligula, but Caligula refuses to touch it, as he considers it to be "bewitched".
</p><p>Caligula condemns Marcellus to death by the wish of the members of the audience, based on what they have heard.  Diana then accepts Christ and seeks to join Marcellus, the man she considers to be her husband, in <a href="/wiki/Heaven" title="Heaven">His Kingdom</a> (Heaven). She also denounces Caligula as an insane, tyrannical monster.
</p><p>Caligula condemns Diana to die alongside Marcellus. As they depart the audience hall for their execution, Marcellus is acknowledged by his repentant father, and Diana gives the robe to Marcipor.
</p><p>Recuperating from a broken leg, adventuresome professional photographer L. B. "Jeff" Jefferies (Stewart) is confined to a wheelchair in his <a href="/wiki/Greenwich_Village" title="Greenwich Village">Greenwich Village</a> apartment. His rear window looks out onto a courtyard and several other apartments. During a powerful <a href="/wiki/Heat_wave" title="Heat wave">heat wave</a>, he watches his neighbors, who keep their windows open to stay cool.
</p><p>He observes a flamboyant dancer he nicknames "Miss Torso"; a single middle-aged woman he calls "Miss Lonelyhearts"; a talented, single, middle-aged composer-pianist; several married couples; a female sculptor; and Lars Thorwald (Burr), a traveling jewelry salesman with a bedridden wife.
</p><p>Jeff's sophisticated, beautiful <a href="/wiki/Socialite" title="Socialite">socialite</a> girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), visits him regularly, as does his insurance company's nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter). Stella wants Jeff to settle down and marry Lisa, but Jeff is reluctant.
</p><p>One night during a thunderstorm, Jeff hears a woman scream "Don't!" and then the sound of breaking glass. Later, he is awakened by thunder and observes Thorwald leaving his apartment. Thorwald makes repeated late-night trips carrying his sample case. The next morning, Jeff notices that Thorwald's wife is gone, and then sees Thorwald cleaning a large knife and handsaw. Later, Thorwald ties a large trunk with heavy rope and has moving men haul it away. Jeff discusses all this with Lisa and with Stella.
</p><p>Jeff becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife. Jeff explains this to his friend Tom Doyle (<a href="/wiki/Wendell_Corey" title="Wendell Corey">Wendell Corey</a>), a <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department" title="New York City Police Department">New York City Police</a> detective, and asks him to do some research. Doyle finds nothing suspicious; apparently, Mrs. Thorwald is upstate, and picked up the trunk herself.
</p><p>Soon after, a neighbor's dog is found dead with its neck broken. The dog's owner yells across the courtyard, complaining of her neighbors' callous disregard of others. All the neighbors run to their windows to see what is happening, except for Thorwald, whose cigar can be seen glowing as he sits quietly in his dark apartment.
</p><p>Certain that Thorwald is also guilty of killing the dog, Jeff asks Lisa to slip an accusatory note under his door, so Jeff can watch his reaction when he reads it. Then, as a pretext to get Thorwald out of his apartment, Jeff telephones him and arranges a meeting at a bar. He believes Thorwald buried something incriminating in the courtyard flower bed, and killed the dog to stop it digging there, so when Thorwald leaves, Lisa and Stella dig up the flowers; they find nothing.
</p><p>Much to Jeff's amazement and admiration, Lisa then climbs the fire escape to Thorwald's apartment and clambers in through an open window. When Thorwald returns and grabs Lisa, Jeff calls the police, who arrive in time to save her by arresting her. Jeff sees Lisa has her hands behind her back, wiggling her finger with Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring on it. Thorwald notices this, and, realizing that she is signaling to someone, he sees Jeff across the courtyard.
</p><p>Jeff phones Doyle and leaves an urgent message. Stella heads for the police station to post bail for Lisa. When his phone rings, Jeff assumes it is Doyle, and says that the suspect has left the apartment. When no one answers, Jeff realizes that Thorwald himself had called, and is heading over to confront him. When Thorwald enters, Jeff repeatedly sets off his camera flashbulbs, temporarily blinding him. However, Thorwald grabs Jeff and manages to push him out of the open window, as Jeff is yelling for help. Police officers enter the apartment as he falls to the ground; other officers have run over to break his fall. Thorwald confesses to the police soon afterward.
</p><p>A few days later, the heat has lifted, and Jeff rests peacefully in his wheelchair, now with casts on both legs. The lonely neighbor is chatting with the pianist in his apartment, the dancer's lover returns home from the army, the couple whose dog was killed have a new dog, and the newly married couple are bickering.
</p><p>Lisa reclines on the daybed in Jeff's apartment, wearing jeans and apparently reading a book titled <i>Beyond the High Himalayas</i>. As soon as Jeff falls asleep, Lisa puts the book down and happily opens a fashion magazine.
</p><p>On <a href="/wiki/Christmas_Eve" title="Christmas Eve">Christmas Eve</a>, 1944, somewhere in Europe, two <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Army" title="U.S. Army">U.S. Army</a> soldiers, one a <a href="/wiki/Broadway_theatre" title="Broadway theatre">Broadway</a> entertainer, Captain Bob Wallace (<a href="/wiki/Bing_Crosby" title="Bing Crosby">Bing Crosby</a>), the other an aspiring entertainer, Private First Class Phil Davis (<a href="/wiki/Danny_Kaye" title="Danny Kaye">Danny Kaye</a>), perform for the 151st Division ("White Christmas"). But, word has come down that their beloved commanding officer, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Major_General_(United_States)" title="Major General (United States)">Major General</a> Thomas F. Waverly (<a href="/wiki/Dean_Jagger" title="Dean Jagger">Dean Jagger</a>), is being relieved of his command. He arrives for the end of the show and delivers an emotional farewell. The men give him a rousing send-off ("The Old Man").
</p><p>At the end of the performance, everyone is forced to take cover from an aerial bombing run. One bomb knocks over a partially-destroyed building, but Bob is too busy shouting orders to notice. Phil throws him out of the way and his arm is injured by debris. Bob later visits Phil at a field hospital and thanks the private for saving his life. When Bob offers a favor to repay the debt, Phil shows him a duet he wrote and asks to perform with Bob back in New York City. Feeling obligated by Phil's heroism, Bob agrees.
</p><p>After the war, Bob and Phil make it big in nightclubs, radio, and then on Broadway, eventually becoming successful producers ("Hi Hup", "Heat Wave", "Blue Skies"). They mount their newest hit musical titled <i>Playing Around</i>. The same day they receive a letter from "Freckle-Faced Haynes, the dog-faced boy," their mess sergeant from the war, asking them to look at an act that his two sisters are doing.
</p><p>When they go to the club to watch the act ("Sisters"), Phil notices that Bob is smitten with Betty (<a href="/wiki/Rosemary_Clooney" title="Rosemary Clooney">Rosemary Clooney</a>). Phil has eyes for her sister, Judy (<a href="/wiki/Vera-Ellen" title="Vera-Ellen">Vera-Ellen</a>). Betty and Judy join Bob and Phil at their table, and Phil dances with Judy, so that Bob and Betty can get to know each other. Phil and Judy hit it off ("The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"). Bob and Betty do not, getting into a minor argument about how Bob thinks that everyone has an angle in show business.
</p><p>Judy and Betty are headed for the Columbia Inn in Pine Tree, Vermont, where they are booked to perform over the holidays. Due to a disagreement with their landlord (he claimed that they had burned an expensive rug at his hotel and had even summoned the sheriff to arrest them), the girls have to leave immediately, so Phil gives the sisters his and Bob's sleeping-room accommodations aboard the train and delays the sheriff by imitating the girls' signature number ("Sisters" redux). Bob and Phil board later and Bob is extremely upset that they have to stay up all night in the club car on their way to NYC. They are joined by Betty and Judy, who thank them profusely for the tickets and convince them to come with them to Pine Tree ("Snow").
</p><p>When the train arrives in Pine Tree, there's not a snowflake in sight, and chances of it falling appear dim. Bob and Phil discover that the inn is run by their former commanding officer, General Waverly. Waverly has invested all of his savings into the lodge, which is in danger of failing because there's no snow and thus no guests. To bring business to the inn, Bob and Phil bring the entire cast and crew of their musical <i>Playing Around</i>, and add in Betty and Judy to the rehearsals ("Minstrel Number"). Bob and Betty's relationship blooms ("Count Your Blessings") and they spend a good deal of time together. Meanwhile, Bob discovers the General's request to rejoin the army has been rejected. He decides to prove to the General that he isn't forgotten.
</p><p>While rehearsals continue ("Choreography") Bob calls Ed Harrison (<a href="/wiki/Johnny_Grant_(radio_personality)" title="Johnny Grant (radio personality)">Johnny Grant</a>), an old army buddy, now a successful variety show host, to arrange a televised invitation to all the men formerly under the command of the General to come to the inn on Christmas Eve as a surprise. In response, Harrison suggests they go all out and put the show on national television to generate free advertising for Wallace and Davis, but Bob insists that it will have nothing to do with their business. Unbeknownst to Bob, nosy housekeeper Emma Allen (<a href="/wiki/Mary_Wickes" title="Mary Wickes">Mary Wickes</a>) has been eavesdropping, but she has only heard the part about free advertising, not Bob's rejection of the idea.
</p><p>Mistakenly believing that her beloved boss will be portrayed as a pitiable figure in a nationwide broadcast, Emma reveals what she has heard to a shocked Betty. The misunderstanding causes Betty to grow suddenly cold towards a baffled Bob. While this is happening, Judy becomes convinced that Betty will never take on a serious relationship until Judy is engaged or married. She pressures a reluctant Phil to announce a phony engagement, but the plan backfires when Betty abruptly departs for New York City to take a job offer since Judy is taken care of.
</p><p>After rehearsals are complete ("Abraham Number"), Phil and Judy reveal to Bob that the engagement was phony. Bob, still unaware of the real reason behind Betty's coldness, goes to New York for <i>The Ed Harrison Show</i>, but decides to stop and try to convince Betty to come back. Bob sees Betty's new act ("Love, You Didn't Do Right by Me") and reveals the truth about the engagement, and Betty starts to warm up to him, but he is called away by Ed Harrison before learning what is really bothering her. Back at the Inn, Phil fakes an injury to distract the General so he won't see the broadcast of Bob's announcement.
</p><p>On the broadcast, Bob invites veterans of the 151st Division to come to Pine Tree, Vermont, on Christmas Eve ("What Can You Do with a General"). Betty catches Bob's televised pitch and realizes she was mistaken. She returns to Pine Tree in time for the Christmas Eve show, but only tells Judy. The whole division comes into Pine Tree secretly. When the General enters the lodge, he is greeted by his former division, who sing a rousing chorus of "The Old Man." Just as the following number ("Gee, I Wish I Was Back in the Army") ends, he learns that snow is finally falling.
</p><p>In the finale, Bob and Betty declare their love for one another, as do Phil and Judy. The background of the set is removed to show the snow falling, and Bob, Betty, Phil and Judy perform "white Christmas" while everyone raises a glass, and toasts, "May your days be merry and bright; and may all your Christmases be white."
</p><p>In 1868, rumors of a <a href="/wiki/Sea_monster" title="Sea monster">sea monster</a> attacking ships in the Pacific Ocean have disrupted shipping lanes. The United States invites Professor Pierre M. Aronnax and his assistant, Conseil, onto a Navy expedition to prove the monster's existence. On board with them is the cocky master harpooner Ned Land.
</p><p>After months of searching, the "monster" is spotted shortly before it rams the warship. Ned and Aronnax are thrown overboard, and Conseil goes in after Aronnax. The helpless, crippled frigate drifts away, and no one aboard responds to the overboard passengers. The three find a strange-looking metal vessel, and realize the "monster" is a man-made "submerging boat" that appears deserted. Aronnax finds a large viewport and witnesses an underwater funeral.
</p><p>Ned, Aronnax, and Conseil attempt to leave in their lifeboat, but the submarine crew stops the castaways. The captain introduces himself as Nemo, master of the <i><a href="/wiki/Nautilus_(Verne)" title="Nautilus (Verne)">Nautilus</a></i>. He returns Ned and Conseil to the deck while offering Aronnax, whom he recognizes for his work, the chance to stay. After Aronnax proves willing to die with his companions, Nemo allows Ned and Conseil to remain.
</p><p>Nemo takes them to the <a href="/wiki/Penal_colony" title="Penal colony">penal colony</a> island of Rura Penthe. Nemo was a prisoner there, as were many of his crew. The prisoners are loading a munitions ship. The <i>Nautilus</i> rams it, destroying its cargo and killing the crew. An anguished Nemo tells Aronnax that his actions have saved thousands from death in war; he also discloses that this "hated nation" tortured his wife and son to death while attempting to force him to reveal the secrets of his work (one of which is implied to be <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_power" title="Nuclear power">nuclear power</a>). Ned discovers the coordinates of Nemo's secret island base, Vulcania, and releases messages in bottles, hoping somebody will find them.
</p><p>Off the coast of <a href="/wiki/New_Guinea" title="New Guinea">New Guinea</a>, the <i>Nautilus</i> becomes stranded on a reef. Ned is surprised when Nemo allows him to go ashore with Conseil, ostensibly to collect specimens, while strictly admonishing them to stay on the beach. Ned goes off alone to explore avenues of escape. While drinking from a pool, he sees human skulls on stakes. Ned runs for his life and rejoins Conseil, and they row away, pursued by cannibals. Aboard ship, the cannibals are repelled by electrical charges through its hull. Nemo is furious with Ned for disobeying his orders, confining him to the brig.
</p><p>A warship approaches, firing upon <i>Nautilus</i>, which descends into the depths, where it attracts a <a href="/wiki/Giant_squid" title="Giant squid">giant squid</a>. After a similar electric charge fails to repel the monster, Nemo and his men surface during a storm to dislodge it. Nemo is caught in one of its tentacles. Ned, having escaped from captivity, saves Nemo from drowning. Nemo has a change of heart and claims he wants to make peace with the world.
</p><p>As the <i>Nautilus</i> nears Vulcania, Nemo finds the island surrounded by warships whose marines are converging on his base. As Nemo goes ashore, Ned tries to identify himself as the author of the bottled messages. Aronnax is furious, recognizing that Nemo will destroy all evidence of his discoveries. Nemo enters the base and activates a time (<a href="/wiki/Nuclear_weapon" title="Nuclear weapon">atomic</a>) bomb, but is mortally wounded on <i>Nautilus</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s deck from a <a href="/wiki/Slug_(projectile)" title="Slug (projectile)">slug</a> to the back. After navigating the submarine away from Vulcania, Nemo announces he will be "taking the <i>Nautilus</i> down for the last time". The crew declare they will accompany their <a href="/wiki/The_captain_goes_down_with_the_ship" title="The captain goes down with the ship">captain in death</a>.
</p><p>Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned are confined to their cabins. The Nautilus's crew also retreat to their cabins at Nemo's instructions. Ned escapes and manages to surface the <i>Nautilus</i>, hitting a reef in the process and causing the sub to flood. Nemo staggers to his salon viewport, watching his beloved sea as he dies.
</p><p>Aronnax tries retrieving his detailed journal, but the urgency of their escape obliges Ned to knock him unconscious and carry him out. The three companions and Nemo's pet sea lion, Esmeralda, witness Vulcania explode, and Ned apologizes to Aronnax for hitting him. As the <i>Nautilus</i> disappears beneath the waves, Nemo's last words to Aronnax echo: "There is hope for the future. And when the world is ready for a new and better life, all this will someday come to pass, in God's good time".
</p><p>On Christmas morning, 1909, in a quaint Midwestern town, Jim Dear gives his wife Darling an <a href="/wiki/American_Cocker_Spaniel" title="American Cocker Spaniel">American Cocker Spaniel</a> puppy that she names Lady. Lady enjoys a happy life with the couple and befriends two local neighborhood dogs, Jock, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scottish_terrier" title="Scottish terrier">Scottish terrier</a>, and Trusty, a <a href="/wiki/Bloodhound" title="Bloodhound">bloodhound</a>. Meanwhile, across town, a stray mixed breed dog called the Tramp lives on his own, dining on scraps from Tony's <a href="/wiki/Italian_cuisine" title="Italian cuisine">Italian restaurant</a> and protecting his fellow strays Peg (a <a href="/wiki/Pekingese" title="Pekingese">Pekingese</a>) and Bull (a <a href="/wiki/Bulldog" title="Bulldog">bulldog</a>) from the local <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Animal_control_officer" title="Animal control officer">dogcatcher</a>. One day, Lady is saddened after her owners begin treating her rather coldly. Jock and Trusty visit her and determine that their change in behavior is due to Darling expecting a baby. While Jock and Trusty try to explain what a baby is, Tramp interrupts the conversation and offers his own thoughts on the matter, making Jock and Trusty take an immediate dislike to the stray and order him out of the yard. As Tramp leaves, he reminds Lady that "when a baby moves in, a dog moves out."
</p><p>Eventually, the baby arrives and the couple introduces Lady to the infant, of whom Lady becomes very fond and protective. Soon after, Jim Dear and Darling leave for a trip, with their Aunt Sarah looking after the baby and the house. Aunt Sarah's two trouble-making <a href="/wiki/Siamese_cat" title="Siamese cat">Siamese cats</a>, Si and Am, deliberately mess up the house and trick her into thinking that Lady attacked them. Aunt Sarah then takes Lady to a pet shop to get a muzzle. Terrified, Lady flees, only to be pursued by a trio of stray dogs. Tramp rescues her, fighting off the vicious strays, and finds a <a href="/wiki/Beaver" title="Beaver">beaver</a> at the local zoo who can remove the muzzle. Later, Tramp shows Lady how he lives "footloose and collar-free", eventually leading into a candlelit dinner at Tony's. Lady begins to fall in love with Tramp, but she chooses to return home in order to watch over the baby. Tramp offers to escort Lady back home, but when Tramp decides to chase hens around a farmyard for fun, Lady is captured by the dog catcher and brought to the local dog pound. While at the pound, the other dogs (including Peg and Bull, who have been caught) reveal to Lady that Tramp has had multiple girlfriends in the past, and they feel it is unlikely that he will ever settle down. Lady is eventually claimed by Aunt Sarah, who chains her in the backyard as punishment for running away.
</p><p>Jock and Trusty visit to comfort Lady, but when Tramp arrives to apologize, Lady angrily confronts him about his past girlfriends and failure to rescue her from the pound. Tramp sadly leaves, but immediately thereafter a rat sneaks into the house. Lady sees the rat and barks frantically at it, but Aunt Sarah tells her to be quiet. Tramp hears her barking and rushes back, entering the house and cornering the rat in the nursery. Lady breaks free and rushes to the nursery, where Tramp inadvertently knocks over the baby's crib before ultimately killing the rat. The commotion alerts Aunt Sarah, who sees both dogs in the room and thinks they are trying to harm the baby. She pushes Tramp in a closet and locks Lady in the basement, then calls the pound to take Tramp away. Jim Dear and Darling return home as the dog catcher departs, and when they release Lady, she leads them to the dead rat. Overhearing everything, Jock and Trusty chase after the dog catcher's wagon. The dogs are able to track down the wagon and scare the horses, causing the wagon to crash. Jim Dear arrives in a taxi with Lady, and she reunites with Tramp, but their joy is short-lived when they find Trusty pinned underneath the wagon's wheel, motionless, with Jock howling mournfully.
</p><p>That Christmas, Tramp has been adopted into the family, and he and Lady have started their own family, with Lady having given birth to a litter of four puppies (three daughters who look identical to Lady and <a href="/wiki/Scamp_(comics)" title="Scamp (comics)">one son who looks identical to Tramp</a>). Jock comes to see the family along with Trusty, who is still alive and merely suffered a broken leg, which is still healing. Thanks to the puppies, Trusty has a fresh audience for his old stories, but he has forgotten them.
</p><p>In the waning days of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>, the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy" title="United States Navy">United States Navy</a> cargo ship <i>Reluctant</i> (also called “The Bucket”) and her crew are stationed in the "backwater" areas of the Pacific Ocean. The <a href="/wiki/Executive_officer" title="Executive officer">executive officer</a>/cargo chief, <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_(junior_grade)" title="Lieutenant (junior grade)">Lieutenant (junior grade)</a> Douglas A. "Doug" Roberts (<a href="/wiki/Henry_Fonda" title="Henry Fonda">Henry Fonda</a>), tries to shield the dispirited crew from the harsh and unpopular captain, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lieutenant_Commander" title="Lieutenant Commander">Lieutenant Commander</a> Morton (<a href="/wiki/James_Cagney" title="James Cagney">James Cagney</a>). Eager to join the fighting, Roberts repeatedly requests a transfer. Morton is forced by regulation to forward his requests, but refuses to endorse them, which means that they are always rejected. Roberts shares quarters with <a href="/wiki/Ensign_(rank)" title="Ensign (rank)">Ensign</a> Frank Thurlowe Pulver (<a href="/wiki/Jack_Lemmon" title="Jack Lemmon">Jack Lemmon</a>). Pulver spends most of his time idling in his bunk and avoids the captain at all costs, so much so, that Morton is initially unaware that Pulver is part of the crew. Once discovered, Pulver cowers before Morton despite bold ideas for revenge expressed to the crew. 
</p><p>Roberts surreptitiously requests and is granted crew <a href="/wiki/Shore_leave" title="Shore leave">liberty</a> from one of Morton’s superiors; a port captain who wishes to reward the <i>Reluctant's</i> crew for meeting a difficult resupply schedule. The liberty is supposed to be at their next resupply stop, but when the ship reaches an idyllic South Pacific island, Morton denies the crew their much-needed shore leave. In private, Morton tells Roberts that the crew will not get liberty as long as he continues to request a transfer and writes letters regarding disharmony aboard the ship, which endanger Morton's chances of promotion. Morton strikes a bargain with Roberts: In exchange for never requesting another transfer, never bending Morton's rules, and never revealing what has made him change his attitude, Morton will grant the crew liberty.
</p><p>Ashore, the crew lets loose after months of pent-up frustration. Many crewmen are arrested and hauled back to the ship by the <a href="/wiki/Military_police" title="Military police">military police</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Shore_patrol" title="Shore patrol">shore patrol</a>. The next morning, Morton is reprimanded by the port captain and ordered to leave port immediately. Morton is almost speechless with rage at the black mark on his sterling record.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the crewmen are mystified by Roberts’ new strictness. Morton deceives them into thinking that Roberts is trying to get a promotion. When a crew member informs Roberts of a new Navy policy which might assist him in getting a transfer despite the captain's opposition, Roberts refuses to take advantage of it.
</p><p>News of the Allied victory in Europe depresses Roberts further, knowing the war may end soon without his ever seeing combat. Inspired by a patriotic radio speech celebrating <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/VE_Day" title="VE Day">VE Day</a>, Roberts throws Morton's prized palm tree overboard. The captain demands the identity of the culprit, but no one steps forward. He eventually realizes that Roberts is the only person aboard with the nerve to do it. Morton summons him to his quarters and accuses him of the deed. An open microphone reveals to the crew what changed Roberts.
</p><p>Weeks later, Roberts receives an unexpected transfer. "Doc" (<a href="/wiki/William_Powell" title="William Powell">William Powell</a>), the ship's doctor and Roberts' friend, confides to him that the crew risked court-martial by submitting a transfer request with Morton's forged <a href="/wiki/Imprimatur#Other_senses" title="Imprimatur">imprimatur</a>. Before he leaves, the crew presents Roberts with a handmade medal, the Order of the Palm, for "action against the enemy".
</p><p>Several weeks later, Pulver, who has been appointed cargo officer, receives a couple of letters. The first is from Roberts, who speaks enthusiastically about his new assignment aboard the <a href="/wiki/Destroyer" title="Destroyer">destroyer</a> USS <i>Livingston</i> during the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Okinawa" title="Battle of Okinawa">Battle of Okinawa</a>. He goes on to say that he would rather have the Order of the Palm than the <a href="/wiki/Medal_of_Honor" title="Medal of Honor">Medal of Honor</a>. The second letter is from a college classmate of Pulver's who is also assigned to the <i>Livingston</i>, which reveals that Roberts was killed in a <a href="/wiki/Kamikaze" title="Kamikaze">kamikaze</a> attack shortly after the first letter had been posted.
</p><p>Incensed, Pulver throws the captain’s replacement palm tree overboard. He then marches into Morton's cabin, openly bragging about it and brazenly demanding to know why Morton has cancelled the showing of a film that night. Morton slowly shakes his head, realizing that his problems have not gone away.

Moses says he is making his workers more productive, making Rameses wonder if Moses is the man the Hebrews are calling the Deliverer.
</p><p>Nefretiri learns from Memnet that Moses is the son of Hebrew slaves. She kills Memnet but reveals the story to Moses only after he finds the piece of <a href="/wiki/Levite" title="Levite">Levite</a> cloth he was wrapped in as a baby, which Memnet had kept. Moses follows Bithiah to Yoshebel's house where he meets his biological mother, Brother Aaron, and Sister Miriam.
</p><p>Moses learns more about the slaves by working with them. Nefretiri urges him to return to the palace so he may help his people when he becomes pharaoh, to which he agrees after he completes a final task. Moses saves Joshua from death by killing Baka, telling Joshua that he too is Hebrew. The confession is witnessed by the overseer <a href="/wiki/Dathan" title="Dathan">Dathan</a>, who then reports to Rameses. After being arrested, Moses explains that he is not the Deliverer, but would free the slaves if he could. Sethi banishes Moses to the desert leaving Rameses as the sole heir.

While farming, Moses sees the <a href="/wiki/Burning_bush" title="Burning bush">burning bush</a> on the summit of <a href="/wiki/Mount_Sinai" title="Mount Sinai">Mount Sinai</a> and hears the voice of God. Moses returns to Egypt to free the Hebrews.
</p><p>Moses comes before Rameses, now pharaoh, to win the slaves' freedom, turning his staff into a <a href="/wiki/Cobra" title="Cobra">cobra</a>. <a href="/wiki/Jannes_and_Jambres" title="Jannes and Jambres">Jannes</a> performs the same trick with his staves, but Moses's snake swallows his. Rameses prohibits straw from being provided to the Hebrews to make their bricks. Nefretiri rescues Moses from being stoned to death by the Hebrews wherein he reveals that he is married.
</p><p>Egypt is visited by plagues. Moses turns the river Nile to blood at a festival of <a href="/wiki/Khnum" title="Khnum">Khnum</a> and brings burning hail down upon Pharaoh's palace. Moses warns him the next plague to fall upon Egypt will be summoned by Pharaoh himself. Enraged at the plagues, Rameses orders all first-born Hebrews to die, but a cloud of death instead kills all the firstborn of Egypt, including the child of Rameses and Nefretiri. Angrily, Pharaoh exiles the Hebrews, which begins <a href="/wiki/The_Exodus" title="The Exodus">the Exodus</a> from Egypt.
</p><p>Rameses takes his army and pursues the Hebrews to the <a href="/wiki/Red_Sea" title="Red Sea">Red Sea</a>. Moses uses God's help to stop the Egyptians with a <a href="/wiki/Pillar_of_Fire_(theophany)" title="Pillar of Fire (theophany)">pillar of fire</a> and <a href="/wiki/Crossing_the_Red_Sea" title="Crossing the Red Sea">parts the Red Sea</a>. After the Hebrews make it to safety, Moses releases the walls of water, drowning the Egyptian army. A devastated Rameses returns empty-handed to Nefretiri, stating that he now acknowledges Moses's god as God.
</p><p>Moses again ascends the mountain with Joshua. Impatiently, Dathan urges a reluctant Aaron to construct a <a href="/wiki/Golden_calf" title="Golden calf">golden calf</a> idol as a gift for Rameses. A wild and decadent orgy is held by most of the Hebrews.
</p><p>Moses sees the <a href="/wiki/Ten_Commandments" title="Ten Commandments">Ten Commandments</a> created by God in <a href="/wiki/Tablets_of_Stone" title="Tablets of Stone">two stone tablets</a>. Moses descends from the mountain to the sight of decadence. Enraged, he throws the tablets at the golden calf, which explodes, killing the wicked revelers, and causing the others to wander in the wilderness for 40 years.
</p><p>Forty years later, an elderly Moses leads the Hebrews towards <a href="/wiki/Canaan" title="Canaan">Canaan</a>. However, he could not enter the Promised land due to his disobedience to the Lord at the Waters of Strife. He instead names Joshua as leader, and spends the rest of his life at Mount Nebo.
</p><p>In early 1943, British <a href="/wiki/Prisoner_of_war" title="Prisoner of war">POWs</a> arrive by train at a <a href="/wiki/Empire_of_Japan" title="Empire of Japan">Japanese</a> prison camp in Burma. The commandant, Colonel Saito, informs them that all prisoners, regardless of rank, are to work on the construction of a railway bridge over the <a href="/wiki/Khwae_Yai_River" title="Khwae Yai River">River Kwai</a> that will connect Bangkok and Rangoon. The senior British officer, Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson, informs Saito that the <a href="/wiki/Geneva_Convention_(1929)" title="Geneva Convention (1929)">Geneva Conventions</a> exempt officers from manual labour. Nicholson later forbids any escape attempts because they had been ordered by headquarters to surrender, and escapes could be seen as defiance of orders.
</p><p>At the morning assembly, Nicholson orders his officers to remain behind when the enlisted men march off to work. Saito threatens to have them shot, but Nicholson refuses to back down. When Major Clipton, the British medical officer, warns Saito there are too many witnesses for him to get away with murder, Saito leaves the officers standing all day in the intense heat. That evening, the officers are placed in a punishment hut, while Nicholson is locked in an iron box.
</p><p>Meanwhile, three prisoners attempt to escape. Two are shot dead, but <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy" title="United States Navy">United States Navy</a> Commander Shears gets away, although badly wounded. He stumbles into a village of natives, who nurse him back to health and then help him leave by boat.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the prisoners work as little as possible and sabotage whatever they can. Should Saito fail to meet his deadline, he would be obliged to commit <a href="/wiki/Seppuku" title="Seppuku">ritual suicide</a>. Desperate, he uses the anniversary of Japan's victory in the <a href="/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War" title="Russo-Japanese War">Russo-Japanese War</a> as an excuse to save face and announces a general amnesty, releasing Nicholson and his officers and exempting them from manual labour.
</p><p>Nicholson is shocked by the poor job being done by his men. Over the protests of some of his officers, he orders Captain Reeves and Major Hughes to design and build a proper bridge to maintain his men's morale. As the Japanese engineers had chosen a poor site, the original construction is abandoned and a new bridge begun downstream.
</p><p>Shears is enjoying his hospital stay in Ceylon when British Major Warden invites him to join a mission to destroy the bridge before it is completed. Shears is so appalled, he confesses he is not an officer; he impersonated one, expecting better treatment from the Japanese. Warden responds that he already knew and that the American Navy agreed to transfer him to the British to avoid embarrassment. Realising he has no choice, Shears volunteers.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Nicholson drives his men hard to complete the bridge on time. For him, its completion will exemplify the ingenuity and hard work of the <a href="/wiki/British_Army" title="British Army">British Army</a> long after the war's end. When he asks that their Japanese counterparts pitch in as well, a resigned Saito replies that he has already given the order. Clipton expresses grave doubts about the sanity of Colonel Nicholson's efforts to build the bridge in order to show up his Japanese captors.
</p><p>The four commandos parachute in, though one is killed on landing. Later, Warden is wounded in an encounter with a Japanese patrol and has to be carried on a litter. He, Shears, and Canadian Lieutenant Joyce reach the river in time with the assistance of Siamese women bearers and their village chief, Khun Yai. Under cover of darkness, Shears and Joyce plant explosives on the bridge towers below the water line.
</p><p>A train carrying important dignitaries and soldiers is scheduled to be the first to cross the bridge the following day, so Warden waits to destroy both. However, by daybreak the water level has dropped, exposing the wire connecting the explosives to the detonator. Nicholson spots the wire and brings it to Saito's attention. As the train approaches, they hurry down to the riverbank to investigate.
</p><p>Joyce, manning the detonator, breaks cover and stabs Saito to death. Nicholson yells for help, while attempting to stop Joyce from reaching the detonator. When Joyce is mortally wounded by Japanese fire, Shears swims across the river, but is himself shot. Recognising the dying Shears, Nicholson exclaims, "What have I done?" Warden fires a <a href="/wiki/Mortar_(weapon)" title="Mortar (weapon)">mortar</a>, wounding Nicholson. The dying colonel stumbles towards the detonator and collapses on the plunger just in time to blow up the bridge and send the train hurtling into the river below. Warden turns toward the only survivors of the commando raid, the women bearers, and begs their forgiveness for having to kill Joyce and Shears, and throws the mortar launcher away in disgust, and prepares to leave. Clipton, observing the carnage, shakes his head muttering, "Madness!, Madness!".
</p><p>In AD 26, <a href="/wiki/Judah_Ben-Hur" title="Judah Ben-Hur">Judah Ben-Hur</a> (<a href="/wiki/Charlton_Heston" title="Charlton Heston">Charlton Heston</a>) is a wealthy Jewish prince and merchant in <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, who lives with his mother, Miriam (<a href="/wiki/Martha_Scott" title="Martha Scott">Martha Scott</a>); his sister, Tirzah (<a href="/wiki/Cathy_O%27Donnell" title="Cathy O'Donnell">Cathy O'Donnell</a>); and their female servant Amrah (Stella Vitelleschi). The family's loyal slave, the merchant Simonides (<a href="/wiki/Sam_Jaffe" title="Sam Jaffe">Sam Jaffe</a>), pays a visit with his daughter, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Esther_(character)" title="Esther (character)">Esther</a> (<a href="/wiki/Haya_Harareet" title="Haya Harareet">Haya Harareet</a>). Judah and Esther fall in love at first sight, but she is bethrothed to another. Judah's childhood friend, the <a href="/wiki/Roman_citizenship" title="Roman citizenship">Roman citizen</a> <a href="/wiki/Messala_(Ben-Hur)" title="Messala (Ben-Hur)">Messala</a> (<a href="/wiki/Stephen_Boyd" title="Stephen Boyd">Stephen Boyd</a>), is now a <a href="/wiki/Military_tribune" title="Military tribune">tribune</a>. After several years away from Jerusalem, Messala returns as the new commander of the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Roman_legions#Early_Empire_legions" title="List of Roman legions">Roman garrison</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Antonia_Fortress" title="Antonia Fortress">Fortress of Antonia</a>. Messala believes in the glory of <a href="/wiki/Roman_Empire" title="Roman Empire">Rome and its imperial power</a>, while Judah is devoted to his faith and the freedom of the Jewish people. This difference causes tension between the friends, and results in their split after Messala issues an ultimatum demanding that Judah deliver potential rebels amongst the populace to the Roman authorities.
</p><p>During the parade for the new <a href="/wiki/Prefect" title="Prefect">governor</a> of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Iudaea_Province" title="Iudaea Province">Judea</a>, <a href="/wiki/Valerius_Gratus" title="Valerius Gratus">Valerius Gratus</a> (<a href="/wiki/Mino_Doro" title="Mino Doro">Mino Doro</a>), loose tiles fall from the roof of Judah's house. Gratus is thrown from his spooked horse and nearly killed. Although Messala knows this was an accident, he condemns Judah to the <a href="/wiki/Galley_slave" title="Galley slave">galleys</a> and imprisons Miriam and Tirzah due to his residual anger at Judah for his refusal to help. By punishing a known friend and prominent citizen, he hopes to intimidate the Jewish populace. Judah swears to take revenge on Messala. As he and other slaves are being marched to the galleys, they stop in <a href="/wiki/Nazareth" title="Nazareth">Nazareth</a> to water the Romans' horses. Desperate with thirst, Judah begs for water, but the commander of the Roman detachment denies it to him. He collapses, but is revived when <a href="/wiki/Jesus" title="Jesus">Jesus of Nazareth</a> (<a href="/wiki/Claude_Heater" title="Claude Heater">Claude Heater</a>) gives him water. After three years as a galley slave, Judah is assigned to the flagship of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Roman_Consul#Under_the_Empire" title="Roman Consul">Roman Consul</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quintus_Arrius_(character)" title="Quintus Arrius (character)">Quintus Arrius</a> (<a href="/wiki/Jack_Hawkins" title="Jack Hawkins">Jack Hawkins</a>), who has been charged with destroying a fleet of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Macedon" title="Macedon">Macedonian</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pirates" title="Pirates">pirates</a>. Arrius admires Judah's determination and self-discipline, and offers to train him as a <a href="/wiki/Gladiator" title="Gladiator">gladiator</a> or <a href="/wiki/Chariot_racing" title="Chariot racing">charioteer</a>. Judah declines the offer, declaring that God will aid him in his quest for vengeance. When the Roman fleet encounters the Macedonians, Arrius orders all the rowers except Judah to be chained to their oars. Arrius' galley is rammed and sunk, but Judah unchains the other rowers and rescues Arrius. In despair, Arrius wrongly believes the battle ended in defeat and attempts to atone in the Roman way by <a href="/wiki/Suicide#Ritual_suicide" title="Suicide">falling on his sword</a>, but Judah stops him. They are rescued, and Arrius is credited with the Roman fleet's victory. Arrius successfully petitions Emperor <a href="/wiki/Tiberius" title="Tiberius">Tiberius</a> (<a href="/wiki/George_Relph" title="George Relph">George Relph</a>) to free Judah, and <a href="/wiki/Adoption_in_ancient_Rome" title="Adoption in ancient Rome">adopts him as his son</a>.
</p><p>Another year passes. Wealthy again, Judah learns <a href="/wiki/Culture_of_ancient_Rome" title="Culture of ancient Rome">Roman ways</a> and becomes a champion charioteer, but still longs for his family and homeland. Judah returns to Judea. Along the way, he meets <a href="/wiki/Biblical_Magi" title="Biblical Magi">Balthasar</a> (<a href="/wiki/Finlay_Currie" title="Finlay Currie">Finlay Currie</a>) and an Arab, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sheik_Ilderim" title="Sheik Ilderim">Sheik Ilderim</a> (<a href="/wiki/Hugh_Griffith" title="Hugh Griffith">Hugh Griffith</a>). After noting Judah's prowess as a charioteer, the sheik asks him to drive his <i><a href="/wiki/Quadriga" title="Quadriga">quadriga</a></i> in a race before the new governor of Judea, <a href="/wiki/Pontius_Pilate" title="Pontius Pilate">Pontius Pilate</a> (<a href="/wiki/Frank_Thring" title="Frank Thring">Frank Thring</a>). Judah declines, even after he learns that Messala will also compete. Judah returns to his home in Jerusalem. He meets Esther, and learns her arranged marriage did not occur and that she is still in love with him. He visits Messala and demands his mother and sister's freedom. The Romans discover that Miriam and Tirzah have contracted <a href="/wiki/Leprosy" title="Leprosy">leprosy</a> in prison, and expel them from the city. The women beg Esther to conceal their condition from Judah so that he may remember them as they were before, so she tells him that they died. This false revelation changes Judah's mind, and he decides to seek vengeance on Messala by competing against him in the chariot race. During the chariot race, Messala drives a <a href="/wiki/Scythed_chariot" title="Scythed chariot">chariot with blades on the hubs</a> to tear apart competing vehicles. He attempts to destroy Judah's chariot but wrecks his own instead. Messala is fatally trampled on by another passing chariot, while Judah wins the race. Before dying, Messala tells Judah that "the race is not over" and, in one last act of pure hatred, tells him to search for his family in the Valley of the Lepers.
</p><p>Judah visits the nearby leper colony, where he confronts Esther while she is delivering supplies for his mother and sister. Esther convinces Judah to remain hidden from them for now and not break Miriam's wishes. Blaming Roman rule for his family's fate, Judah visits Pilate and rejects his <a href="/wiki/Property" title="Property">patrimony</a> and Roman citizenship. He returns with Esther to the Leper colony, reveals himself to Miriam and finds out that Tirzah is dying. Judah and Esther take Miriam and her daughter to see Jesus of Nazareth, but the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trial_of_Jesus" title="Trial of Jesus">trial of Jesus</a> has begun. As Jesus is being marched through the streets he collapses while carrying his cross. Judah recognizes him as the man who gave him water years before, and returns the gesture. Judah witnesses the crucifixion of Jesus, and Miriam and Tirzah are miraculously healed during the rainstorm following the crucifixion. Judah returns home a changed man and embraces Esther, Miriam and Tirzah.
</p><p>A family on their way to <a href="/wiki/New_Guinea" title="New Guinea">New Guinea</a> is chased by pirates into a hurricane. The captain and crew abandon the ship leaving the family shipwrecked off an uninhabited island. William (<a href="/wiki/John_Mills" title="John Mills">John Mills</a>) and his two eldest sons Fritz and Ernst (<a href="/wiki/James_MacArthur" title="James MacArthur">James MacArthur</a> and <a href="/wiki/Tommy_Kirk" title="Tommy Kirk">Tommy Kirk</a>) salvage as much as they can from the wreck including livestock, tools, and even an organ. As they gather what can be removed from the ship, the pirates return and begin shooting at the ship. Fritz and Ernst begin readying the ship's cannon, but they only have one shot. Suddenly, the pirates turn around; William has <a href="/wiki/File:ICS_India.svg" title="File:ICS India.svg">put up a flag</a> indicating the ship is under <a href="/wiki/Quarantine" title="Quarantine">quarantine</a> and that there is <a href="/wiki/Black_Death" title="Black Death">Black Death</a> aboard. The three men construct a <a href="/wiki/Tree_house" title="Tree house">tree house</a> home on the island while the youngest boy Francis (<a href="/wiki/Kevin_Corcoran" title="Kevin Corcoran">Kevin Corcoran</a>) investigates the wildlife and starts an impressive collection of animals including a young elephant, a capuchin monkey and two <a href="/wiki/Great_Dane" title="Great Dane">Great Danes</a> rescued from the ship which they name Duke and Turk. Elizabeth (<a href="/wiki/Dorothy_McGuire" title="Dorothy McGuire">Dorothy McGuire</a>) prays to be rescued. The boys, particularly Ernst, also build inventions to provide modern amenities to the family such as drawing water and preserving food.
</p><p>Fritz and Ernst head off to explore the island to see if anyone else lives on it or if it is connected to any other lands. While at a distant corner of the island, they again spot the pirates who originally drove them into the storm. The pirates have captured another ship and have the ship's captain, Moreland (<a href="/wiki/Cecil_Parker" title="Cecil Parker">Cecil Parker</a>) and cabin boy "Bertie" captives for ransom. Fritz and Ernst rescue Bertie but Moreland, Bertie's grandfather, stays behind. The three dodge the pirates and head back to the family's tree house. En route, they discover that Bertie is really Roberta (<a href="/wiki/Janet_Munro" title="Janet Munro">Janet Munro</a>) and not a boy at all. The three fend off snakes and hyenas as they head home and even rescue a zebra foal, then lead it home. They arrive back at the treehouse at Christmas.
</p><p>William realizes the pirates will try to reclaim Roberta and decides to make a stand against them. Defenses are prepared by building booby-traps and fortifying a rocky outcropping. They blow up the ship's wreckage in an attempt to make it difficult for the pirates to remember where the family went aground. While prepping for the pirate attack, Fritz and Ernst vie for the affections of Roberta. Ernst is more studious and attempts to impress her with his knowledge and intelligence while Fritz, older and more experienced, uses his charm and physical attributes to attract her. Fritz and Ernst eventually come to blows over her and are stopped only by the intervention of William. He declares the next day the first holiday for "<a href="/wiki/Highland,_Illinois" title="Highland, Illinois">New Switzerland</a>" in an attempt to divert everyone. While prepping for the race (everyone has an animal to ride; Francis has the elephant, Ernst the ostrich, Roberta the zebra, the monkey on Duke, etc.) Elizabeth fires the gun to signal the start of the race; the pirates, who are at that time sailing the coast looking for the place they last saw the ship that brought the family to the island, hear the gun and know the family is near.
</p><p>Led by their captain (<a href="/wiki/Sessue_Hayakawa" title="Sessue Hayakawa">Sessue Hayakawa</a>) the pirates storm the island, the family manages a brave defense but are sorely pressed. Their defenses include pits with a tiger in one pit, rock piles, a log pile and coconut bombs (hollowed out coconuts filled with gunpowder with a fuse) all of which cause problems for the attacking pirates. When the pirate leader waves a <a href="/wiki/White_flag" title="White flag">white flag</a> the family imagines they have routed the pirates, but the pirates instead are sneaking around the back of the fort. Francis' much-maligned "pirate alarm" is the only thing that warns them of the surprise attack. They begin defending the fortress but are soon down to only a few shots with their muskets. At this critical moment, a ship appears on the horizon captained by Roberta's grandfather captain Moreland and fires its cannons while the retreating pirates are trying to make a desperate escape. The cannon fire hits the pirate ship while the family rejoices. William, Elizabeth and Francis choose to remain on the island with Duke, Turk and Francis' collection of animals while Moreland notes that William will likely be recommended as governor of the new colony. As for the rest of the family, Ernst chooses to return to Europe with the rescuers in order to enroll in a university to continue his studies while Fritz and Roberta plan to marry (presumably by virtue of her grandfather's sea captaincy) and make New Switzerland their home.
</p><p>In the 1st century BC, the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Republic" title="Roman Republic">Roman Republic</a> has slid into corruption, its menial work done by armies of slaves. One of these, a proud and gifted <a href="/wiki/Thrace" title="Thrace">Thracian</a> named Spartacus (<a href="/wiki/Kirk_Douglas" title="Kirk Douglas">Kirk Douglas</a>), is so uncooperative in his position in a mining pit that he is sentenced to death by starvation. By chance, he is displayed to unctuous Roman businessman Lentulus Batiatus (<a href="/wiki/Peter_Ustinov" title="Peter Ustinov">Peter Ustinov</a>), who – impressed by his ferocity – purchases Spartacus for his gladiatorial school, where he instructs trainer Marcellus (<a href="/wiki/Charles_McGraw" title="Charles McGraw">Charles McGraw</a>) to not overdo his indoctrination because he thinks "he has quality". Amid the abuse, Spartacus forms a quiet relationship with a serving woman named Varinia (<a href="/wiki/Jean_Simmons" title="Jean Simmons">Jean Simmons</a>), whom he refuses to rape when she is sent to "entertain" him in his cell. Spartacus and Varinia are subsequently forced to endure numerous humiliations for defying the conditions of servitude.
</p><p>Batiatus receives a visit from the immensely wealthy Roman senator <a href="/wiki/Marcus_Licinius_Crassus" title="Marcus Licinius Crassus">Marcus Licinius Crassus</a> (<a href="/wiki/Laurence_Olivier" title="Laurence Olivier">Laurence Olivier</a>), who aims to become dictator of the stagnant republic. Crassus buys Varinia on a whim, and for the amusement of his companions arranges for Spartacus and three others to fight in pairs. When Spartacus is disarmed, his opponent, an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ethnic_groups_of_Africa" title="Ethnic groups of Africa">African</a> named Draba (<a href="/wiki/Woody_Strode" title="Woody Strode">Woody Strode</a>), spares his life in a burst of defiance and attacks the Roman audience, but is killed by an arena guard and Crassus. The next day, with the ludus' atmosphere still tense over this episode, Batiatus takes Varinia away to Crassus's house in Rome. Spartacus kills Marcellus, who was taunting him over his affections, and their fight escalates into a riot. The gladiators overwhelm their guards and escape into the Italian countryside.
</p><p>Spartacus is elected chief of the fugitives and decides to lead them out of <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a> and back to their homes. They plunder Roman country estates as they go, collecting enough money to buy sea transport from Rome's foes, the pirates of <a href="/wiki/Cilicia" title="Cilicia">Cilicia</a>. Countless other slaves join the group, making it as large as an army. One of the new arrivals is Varinia, who escaped while being delivered to Crassus. Another is a slave entertainer named Antoninus (<a href="/wiki/Tony_Curtis" title="Tony Curtis">Tony Curtis</a>), who also fled Crassus's service. Privately, Spartacus feels mentally inadequate because of his lack of education during years of servitude.  However, he proves an excellent leader and organizes his diverse followers into a tough and self-sufficient community. Varinia, now his informal wife, becomes pregnant by him, and he also comes to regard the spirited Antoninus as a sort of son.
</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Roman_Senate" title="Roman Senate">Roman Senate</a> becomes increasingly alarmed as Spartacus defeats the multiple armies it sends against him. Crassus's populist opponent Gracchus (<a href="/wiki/Charles_Laughton" title="Charles Laughton">Charles Laughton</a>) knows that his rival will try to use the crisis as a justification for seizing control of the Roman army. To try and prevent this, Gracchus channels as much military power as possible into the hands of his own protege, a young senator named Julius Caesar (<a href="/wiki/John_Gavin" title="John Gavin">John Gavin</a>). Although Caesar lacks Crassus's contempt for the lower classes of Rome, he mistakes the man's rigid outlook for nobility. Thus, when Gracchus reveals that he has bribed the Cilicians to get Spartacus out of Italy and rid Rome of the slave army, Caesar regards such tactics as beneath him and goes over to Crassus.
</p><p>Crassus uses a bribe of his own to make the pirates abandon Spartacus and has the Roman army secretly force the rebels away from the coastline towards Rome. Amid panic that Spartacus means to sack the city, the Senate gives Crassus absolute power. Now surrounded by Romans, Spartacus convinces his men to die fighting. Just by rebelling and proving themselves human, he says that they have struck a blow against slavery. In the ensuing battle, after initially breaking the ranks of Crassus's legions, the slave army ends up trapped between Crassus and two other forces advancing from behind, and most of them are massacred. Afterward, the Romans try to locate the rebel leader for special punishment by offering a pardon (and return to enslavement) if the men will identify Spartacus, living or dead. Every surviving man responds by shouting "I'm Spartacus!" (an idea from Fast's novel, not documented by history). As a result, Crassus has them all sentenced to death by <a href="/wiki/Crucifixion" title="Crucifixion">crucifixion</a> along the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Via_Appia" title="Via Appia">Via Appia</a> between Rome and <a href="/wiki/Capua" title="Capua">Capua</a>, where the revolt began.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Crassus has found Varinia and Spartacus's newborn son and has taken them prisoner. He is disturbed by the idea that Spartacus can command more love and loyalty than he can and hopes to compensate by making Varinia as devoted to him as she was to her former husband. When she rejects him, he furiously seeks out Spartacus (whom he recognizes from having watched him at Batiatus' school) and forces him to fight Antoninus to the death. The survivor is to be crucified, along with all the other men captured after the great battle. Spartacus kills Antoninus to spare him this terrible fate. The incident leaves Crassus worried about Spartacus's potential to live in legend as a <a href="/wiki/Martyr" title="Martyr">martyr</a>. In other matters, he is also worried about Caesar, whom he senses will someday eclipse him.
</p><p>Gracchus, having seen Rome fall into tyranny, commits suicide. Before doing so, he bribes his friend Batiatus to rescue Spartacus's family from Crassus and carry them away to freedom. On the way out of Rome, the group passes under Spartacus's cross. Varinia is able to comfort him in his dying moments by showing him his little son, who will grow up free and knowing who his father was.
</p><p>During a lunchtime tryst in a <a href="/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona" title="Phoenix, Arizona">Phoenix</a>, <a href="/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a> hotel,  real-estate secretary Marion Crane and her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, discuss how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client leaves a $40,000 cash payment on a property. Marion's boss asks her to deposit the money in the bank, and allows her to leave work early after she complains of a headache. Once home, she decides to steal the money and drive to Fairvale, <a href="/wiki/California" title="California">California</a>, where Sam lives.
</p><p>En route to Fairvale, Marion pulls over on the side of the road and falls asleep; she is awakened by a state patrol trooper. Suspicious about her skittish behavior, he follows her as she drives away. Hoping to lose him, Marion stops at a <a href="/wiki/Bakersfield,_California" title="Bakersfield, California">Bakersfield</a>, California automobile dealership and trades in her <a href="/wiki/Ford_Mainline" title="Ford Mainline">Ford Mainline</a>, with its Arizona license plates, for a <a href="/wiki/Ford_Custom" title="Ford Custom">Ford Custom</a> 300 with California tags. The officer sees Marion at the car dealership and eyes her suspiciously as she abruptly drives away.
</p><p>During a heavy rainstorm, Marion stops for the night at the Bates Motel. The proprietor, Norman Bates, invites her to share a light dinner after she checks in. She accepts his invitation but overhears an argument between Norman and <a href="/wiki/Norma_Bates_(Psycho)" title="Norma Bates (Psycho)">his mother</a> about bringing a woman into their <a href="/wiki/Carpenter_Gothic" title="Carpenter Gothic">Gothic</a> home, which sits perched above the motel. Instead they eat in the motel parlor, where he tells her about his life with his mother, who is mentally ill and forbids him to have an independent life.
</p><p>Moved by Norman's story, Marion decides to drive back to Phoenix in the morning to return the stolen money, which she hides in a folded newspaper on the nightstand. As she showers, a shadowy figure stabs her to death with a chef's knife. After seeing blood, Norman panics and runs to Marion's room, where he discovers her body. He cleans up the crime scene, putting Marion's corpse and her possessions—including the stolen money—into the trunk of her car and sinking it in the swamps near the motel.
</p><p>A week later, Marion's sister Lila arrives in Fairvale and confronts Sam about Marion's whereabouts. Private investigator Milton Arbogast approaches them and confirms that Marion is wanted for stealing the $40,000. He sleuths local hotels and motels, and Norman's evasive and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicion. After hearing that Marion met Norman's mother, he asks to speak with her, but Norman refuses to allow it. Arbogast updates Sam and Lila about his search for Marion and promises to phone again soon. He goes to the Bates' home in search of Norman's mother; as he reaches the top of the stairs, he is murdered.
</p><p>When Lila and Sam do not hear from Arbogast, Sam visits the motel. He sees a figure in the house who he assumes is Mrs. Bates, but she ignores his knocking. Lila and Sam go to the local deputy sheriff, who informs them that Mrs. Bates died in a murder-suicide ten years ago. The sheriff concludes that Arbogast lied to Sam and Lila so he could pursue Marion and the money. Convinced that some ill has befallen Arbogast, Lila and Sam make their way to the motel. Norman carries his mother from her room and hides her in the fruit cellar against her will.
</p><p>At the motel, Sam distracts Norman by engaging in conversation while Lila cases the property and sneaks inside the house. After Sam grills him, Norman becomes agitated, knocks Sam out, and rushes to the house. Lila hides in the cellar, where she finds Mrs. Bates in a chair. Lila turns her around and discovers she is a mummified corpse. Lila screams as Norman runs into the cellar, holding a knife and wearing his mother's clothes and a wig. Before Norman can attack Lila, Sam, having regained consciousness, subdues him.
</p><p>At the courthouse, a psychiatrist explains that Norman murdered Mrs. Bates and her lover ten years ago out of jealousy. Unable to bear the guilt, he exhumed her corpse and began to treat it as if she were still alive. He recreated his mother in his own mind as an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Multiple_personality_disorder" title="Multiple personality disorder">alternate personality</a>, dressing in her clothes and talking to himself in her voice. This "Mother" personality is jealous and possessive: whenever Norman feels attracted to a woman, "Mother" kills her. As "Mother", Norman killed two young girls before stabbing Marion and Arbogast to death. The psychiatrist says the "Mother" personality has taken permanent hold of Norman's mind. While Norman sits in a holding cell, "Mother"<span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s voice-over protests that the murders were Norman's doing. Marion's car is pulled out of the swamp.
</p><p>Songwriter Roger Radcliffe lives in a bachelor flat in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, along with his pet <a href="/wiki/Dalmatian_dog" title="Dalmatian dog">Dalmatian</a>, Pongo. Bored with bachelor life, Pongo decides to find a wife for Roger and a mate for himself. While watching various women with their female dog look alikes out the window, he spots the perfect pair, a woman named Anita and her female Dalmatian, Perdita. He quickly gets Roger out of the house and drags him through the park to arrange a meeting.  Roger and Anita eventually fall in love and get married with their dogs.
</p><p>Later, Perdita gives birth to a litter of 15 puppies. That same night, they are visited by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cruella_De_Vil" title="Cruella De Vil">Cruella De Vil</a>, a wealthy former schoolmate of Anita's. She offers to buy the entire litter, but Roger says they are not for sale, leading to a falling out. A few weeks later, she hires her henchmen, Jasper and Horace, to steal them. When <a href="/wiki/Metropolitan_Police_Service" title="Metropolitan Police Service">Scotland Yard</a> is unable to find them, Pongo and Perdita use the "<a href="/wiki/Twilight_bark" title="Twilight bark">Twilight bark</a>", a canine gossip line, to ask for help from the other dogs in London.
</p><p>Colonel, an <a href="/wiki/Old_English_Sheepdog" title="Old English Sheepdog">Old English Sheepdog</a>, along with his compatriots Captain, a gray horse, and Sergeant Tibbs, a tabby cat, find the puppies in a place called Hell Hall (Cruella's abandoned and dilapidated family estate, also known as The De Vil Place), along with 84 other Dalmatian puppies that she had bought from various dog stores. When Tibbs learns they are going to be made into dog-skin <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fur_coat" title="Fur coat">fur coats</a>, Colonel quickly sends word back to London. Upon receiving the message, Pongo and Perdita leave town to retrieve their puppies. Winter has come, and they must cross the <a href="/wiki/River_Stour,_Suffolk" title="River Stour, Suffolk">Stour River</a> which is running fast and laden with slabs of broken ice. Meanwhile, Tibbs overhears Cruella ordering Jasper and Horace to kill the puppies that night out of fear the police will soon find them. In response, Tibbs attempts to rescue them while Jasper and Horace are preoccupied watching television, but they finish their show and come for them before he can get them out of the house. Pongo and Perdita break in and confront Jasper and Horace just as they are about to kill the puppies. While the adult dogs attack them, Colonel and Tibbs guide the puppies from the house.
</p><p>After a happy reunion with their own puppies, Pongo and Perdita realize there are dozens of others with them, 99 altogether including their own. Shocked at Cruella's plans, Pongo and Perdita decide to adopt the other 84 puppies, certain that Roger and Anita would never reject them. The Dalmatians begin making their way back to London through deep snow, as all open water is frozen solid. Other animals help them along the way, while Cruella, Jasper, and Horace chase them. In one town, they cover themselves with soot to disguise themselves as <a href="/wiki/Labrador_Retriever" title="Labrador Retriever">Labradors</a>, then pile inside a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Moving_van" title="Moving van">moving van</a> bound for London. As it is leaving, melting snow clears off the soot and Cruella sees them. Enraged, she follows the van in her car and rams it, but Jasper and Horace, who try to cut it off from above, end up crashing into her. Both vehicles are smashed to smithereens and fall into a deep ravine, leaving Cruella and her henchmen stranded and defeated at last. Cruella yells in frustration as the van drives away.
</p><p>Back in London, Roger and Anita are attempting to celebrate Christmas and his first big hit, a song about Cruella, but they miss their canine companions. Suddenly, barking is heard outside and, after their nanny opens the door, the house is filled with dogs. After wiping away the rest of the soot, they are delighted to realize their pets have returned home. After counting 84 extra puppies, they decide to keep all the puppies and use the money from Roger's song to buy a larger house in the country so they can have a Dalmatian plantation.
</p><p>In the summer of 1957 in the <a href="/wiki/West_Side_(Manhattan)" title="West Side (Manhattan)">West Side</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Lincoln_Square,_Manhattan" title="Lincoln Square, Manhattan">Lincoln Square</a> neighborhood in <a href="/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a>, there is tension between a white American gang, the Jets, led by Riff, and a <a href="/wiki/Puerto_Ricans" title="Puerto Ricans">Puerto Rican</a> gang, the Sharks, led by Bernardo. After a brawl erupts, Lieutenant Schrank and Officer Krupke arrive and break it up. The Jets decide to challenge the Sharks to a rumble at an upcoming dance for neighborhood control.
</p><p>Riff decides that his best friend Tony, the co-founder of the Jets who left the gang, should fight. Riff invites Tony to the dance, but Tony is uninterested. He tells Riff that he senses something important will happen, which Riff suggests could have a correlation with the dance.
</p><p>Bernardo's younger sister, Maria, tells her best friend and Bernardo's girlfriend, Anita, how excited she is about the dance. At the dance, the gangs and girls refuse to intermingle. Tony arrives and he and Maria fall in love. However, Bernardo angrily demands that Tony stay away from her. Riff proposes a meeting with Bernardo at Doc's drug store.
</p><p>Maria is sent home; Anita argues that Bernardo is overprotective of Maria and they compare the advantages of Puerto Rico and the United States.
</p><p>Tony discreetly visits Maria on her fire escape, where they reaffirm their love. Krupke, who suspects the Jets are planning something, visits them and warns them not to cause trouble. When the Sharks arrive, both groups agree to have the showdown the following evening under the highway, with a one-on-one fist fight. When Schrank arrives, the gangs feign friendship. Schrank orders the Sharks out and unsuccessfully tries to discover information about the fight.
</p><p>The next day at the bridal shop, Anita accidentally tells Maria about the rumble. Tony arrives to see Maria, which shocks Anita. They profess their love and Anita warns them about the consequences if Bernardo learns of their relationship. Maria has Tony promise to prevent the rumble. Tony and Maria fantasize about their wedding ceremony.
</p><p>The Jets and Sharks approach the area under the highway. Tony arrives to stop the fight, but Bernardo antagonizes him. Unwilling to watch Tony be humiliated, Riff initiates a knife fight. Tony tries to intervene, which leads to Bernardo killing Riff. Tony kills Bernardo with Riff's knife and a melee ensues. Police sirens blare and everyone flees, leaving behind the dead bodies.
</p><p>Maria waits for Tony on the rooftop of her apartment building when her fiancé Chino arrives and tells her what happened. Tony arrives and explains what transpired and asks for her forgiveness before he turns himself in to the police. Maria confirms her love for him and asks Tony to stay with her.
</p><p>The Jets have reassembled outside a garage, with their new leader, Ice, having them focus on reacting to the police. Anybodys arrives and warns them that Chino is now after Tony. Ice sends the Jets to warn Tony.
</p><p>Anita enters the apartment while Tony and Maria are in the bedroom. Tony and Maria arrange to meet at Doc's, where they will pick up getaway money to elope. Anita spots Tony leaving through the window and chides Maria for the relationship, but Maria convinces her to help them elope.
</p><p>Schrank arrives and questions Maria about the rumble. To cover for Tony, Maria has Anita tell him that Maria is detained from meeting him. When Anita reaches Doc's, the Jets harass her, until Doc intervenes. Anita declares that Bernardo was right about them and that Chino killed Maria. Doc banishes the Jets and gives Tony his getaway money in the basement and delivers Anita's message. Tony runs into the streets, shouting for Chino to kill him as well.
</p><p>In the playground next to Doc's, Tony spots Maria and they run toward each other, only for Chino to shoot Tony. The Jets and Sharks arrive to find Maria holding Tony, who dies in her arms. Maria stops the gangs from fighting, takes the gun from Chino and threatens to shoot everyone, blaming their hate for the deaths. Schrank, Krupke and Doc arrive and the gangs form a funeral procession, with Maria following. The police arrest Chino and lead him away.
</p><p>The film is presented in two parts, divided by an <a href="/wiki/Intermission#Films" title="Intermission">intermission</a>.
</p><p>The film opens in 1935 when Lawrence is killed in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Motorcycle_accident" title="Motorcycle accident">motorcycle accident</a>. At his memorial service at <a href="/wiki/St_Paul%27s_Cathedral" title="St Paul's Cathedral">St Paul's Cathedral</a>, a reporter tries (with little success) to gain insights into this remarkable, enigmatic man from those who knew him.
</p><p>The story then moves backward to the <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">First World War</a>, where Lawrence is a misfit <a href="/wiki/British_Army" title="British Army">British Army</a> <a href="/wiki/Lieutenant_(British_Army_and_Royal_Marines)" title="Lieutenant (British Army and Royal Marines)">lieutenant</a>, notable for his insolence and education. Over the objections of <a href="/wiki/Archibald_Murray" title="Archibald Murray">General Murray</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mr._Dryden" title="Mr. Dryden">Mr. Dryden</a> of the <a href="/wiki/Arab_Bureau" title="Arab Bureau">Arab Bureau</a> sends him to assess the prospects of <a href="/wiki/Faisal_I_of_Iraq" title="Faisal I of Iraq">Prince Faisal</a> in <a href="/wiki/Arab_Revolt" title="Arab Revolt">his revolt</a> against the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Turks</a>. On the journey, his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bedouin_people" title="Bedouin people">Bedouin</a> guide, Tafas, is killed by Sherif Ali for drinking from his well without permission. Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton, who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment, and leave. Lawrence ignores Brighton's orders when he meets Faisal. His outspokenness piques the prince's interest.
</p><p>Brighton advises Faisal to retreat after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Aqaba" title="Battle of Aqaba">surprise attack on Aqaba</a>; its capture would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. The town is strongly fortified against a naval assault but only lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical Sherif Ali. Teenage orphans Daud and Farraj attach themselves to Lawrence as servants. They cross the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nefud_Desert" title="Nefud Desert">Nefud Desert</a>, considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. One of Ali's men, Gasim, succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. When Lawrence discovers him missing, he turns back and rescues Gasim—and Sherif Ali is won over. He gives Lawrence Arab robes to wear.
</p><p>Lawrence persuades <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Auda_abu_Tayi" title="Auda abu Tayi">Auda abu Tayi</a>, the leader of the powerful local <a href="/wiki/Howeitat" title="Howeitat">Howeitat</a> tribe, to turn against the Turks. Lawrence's scheme is almost derailed when one of Ali's men kills one of Auda's because of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Blood_feud" title="Blood feud">blood feud</a>. Howeitat retaliation would shatter the fragile alliance, so Lawrence declares that he will execute the murderer himself. He is then stunned to discover that the culprit is Gasim, the very man whom he risked his own life to save in the desert, but he shoots him anyway.
</p><p>The next morning, the Arabs overrun the Turkish <a href="/wiki/Garrison" title="Garrison">garrison</a>. Lawrence heads to <a href="/wiki/Cairo" title="Cairo">Cairo</a> to inform Dryden and the new commander, <a href="/wiki/Edmund_Allenby,_1st_Viscount_Allenby" title="Edmund Allenby, 1st Viscount Allenby">General Allenby</a>, of his victory. While crossing the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sinai_Desert" title="Sinai Desert">Sinai Desert</a>, Daud dies when he stumbles into <a href="/wiki/Dry_quicksand" title="Dry quicksand">quicksand</a>. Lawrence is promoted to <a href="/wiki/Major_(United_Kingdom)" title="Major (United Kingdom)">major</a> and given arms and money for the Arabs. He is deeply disturbed, however, confessing that he enjoyed executing Gasim, but Allenby brushes aside his qualms. He asks Allenby whether there is any basis for the Arabs' suspicions that the <a href="/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement" title="Sykes–Picot Agreement">British have designs on Arabia</a>. When pressed, the general states that they do not.
</p><p>Lawrence launches a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Guerrilla_war" title="Guerrilla war">guerrilla war</a>, blowing up trains and harassing the Turks at every turn. <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">American</a> <a href="/wiki/War_correspondent" title="War correspondent">war correspondent</a> Jackson Bentley publicises Lawrence's exploits, making him famous. On one raid, Farraj is badly injured. Unwilling to leave him to be tortured by the enemy, Lawrence shoots him dead before fleeing.
</p><p>When Lawrence scouts the enemy-held city of <a href="/wiki/Daraa" title="Daraa">Deraa</a> with Ali, he is taken, along with several Arab residents, to the Turkish <a href="/wiki/Bey" title="Bey">Bey</a>. Lawrence is stripped, ogled, and prodded. Then, for striking out at the Bey, he is severely <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flogging" title="Flogging">flogged</a> before being thrown into the street. The experience leaves Lawrence shaken. He returns to British headquarters in Cairo but does not fit in.
</p><p>A short time later in <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, General Allenby urges him to support the "big push" on <a href="/wiki/Damascus" title="Damascus">Damascus</a>. Lawrence hesitates to return but finally relents.
</p><p>Lawrence recruits an army that is motivated more by money than by the Arab cause. They sight a column of retreating Turkish soldiers who have just massacred the residents of <a href="/wiki/Tafas" title="Tafas">Tafas</a>. One of Lawrence's men is from Tafas; he demands, "No prisoners!" When Lawrence hesitates, the man charges the Turks alone and is killed. Lawrence takes up the dead man's battle cry; the result is a slaughter in which Lawrence himself participates. Afterwards, he regrets his actions.
</p><p>Lawrence's men take Damascus ahead of Allenby's forces. The Arabs set up a council to administer the city, but the desert tribesmen prove ill-suited for such a task. Despite Lawrence's efforts, they bicker constantly. Unable to maintain the <a href="/wiki/Public_utility" title="Public utility">public utilities</a>, the Arabs soon abandon most of the city to the British.
</p><p>Lawrence is promoted to <a href="/wiki/Colonel_(United_Kingdom)" title="Colonel (United Kingdom)">colonel</a> and immediately ordered back to Britain, as his usefulness to both Faisal and the British is at an end. As he leaves the city, his automobile is passed by a motorcyclist who leaves a trail of dust in his wake.
</p><p>The film begins with narration by Spencer Tracy as the aerial-borne camera sweeps over the Rocky Mountains. "This land has a name today," says Tracy in the opening lines of the film, "and is marked on maps."
</p><p>The film then moves into "The Rivers" sequence (considerably to the east of the Rockies).
</p><p>Mountain man Linus Rawlings (Stewart) is making his way by horse and waterway through the mountains. He confers with a group of Indians. The scene then shifts to Zebulon Prescott and his family.
</p><p>Prescott (Malden) and his family set out west for the frontier via the <a href="/wiki/Erie_Canal" title="Erie Canal">Erie Canal</a>, the "West", at this time, being the <a href="/wiki/Ohio_River" title="Ohio River">Ohio River</a> country, at the <a href="/wiki/Battery_Rock" title="Battery Rock">southern edge</a> of <a href="/wiki/Illinois" title="Illinois">Illinois</a>. Along the journey, they meet Rawlings, who is traveling east, to <a href="/wiki/Pittsburgh" title="Pittsburgh">Pittsburgh</a>, to trade his furs. Rawlings and Zebulon's daughter, Eve (<a href="/wiki/Carroll_Baker" title="Carroll Baker">Carroll Baker</a>), are attracted to each other, but Linus is not ready to settle down.
</p><p>Linus Rawlings stops at an isolated trading post, run by a murderous clan of <a href="/wiki/River_pirate" title="River pirate">river pirates</a>, headed by "Alabama Colonel" Jeb Hawkins (<a href="/wiki/Walter_Brennan" title="Walter Brennan">Walter Brennan</a>). Linus is betrayed when he accompanies seductive Dora Hawkins (<a href="/wiki/Brigid_Bazlen" title="Brigid Bazlen">Brigid Bazlen</a>), into a cave, modeled after a real outlaw haunt, now a part of <a href="/wiki/Cave-in-Rock_State_Park" title="Cave-in-Rock State Park">Cave-in-Rock State Park</a>, to see a "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Varmint" title="Varmint">varmint</a>". Dora Hawkins stabs him in the back and Rawlings falls into a deep hole. He is not seriously wounded, and he rescues the Prescott party from a similar fate. The bushwhacking thieves (<a href="/wiki/Lee_Van_Cleef" title="Lee Van Cleef">Lee Van Cleef</a> plays one), including Dora Hawkins, are dispatched, being killed in an attack by Rawlings, in a form of rough frontier justice.
</p><p>After Zebulon prays to God for their lost loved ones and commends to Him the thieves' souls "whether You want 'em or not", the settlers continue down the river, but their raft is caught in <a href="/wiki/Rapids" title="Rapids">rapids</a>, and Zebulon and his wife Rebecca (<a href="/wiki/Agnes_Moorehead" title="Agnes Moorehead">Agnes Moorehead</a>) drown. Linus, finding that he cannot live without Eve, reappears and marries her. She insists on homesteading at the spot where her parents died.

The bloody <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Shiloh" title="Battle of Shiloh">Battle of Shiloh</a> shows Zeb that war is nothing like he imagined, and unknown to him, his father dies there. Zeb encounters a similarly disillusioned Confederate (<a href="/wiki/Russ_Tamblyn" title="Russ Tamblyn">Russ Tamblyn</a>), who suggests deserting.

</p><p>The film is shot in the style of a docudrama (with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Subtitles" title="Subtitles">subtitles</a> identifying the different participants), beginning in the days leading up to D-Day. It concentrates on events on both sides of the channel, such as the Allies waiting for a break in the poor weather and anticipating the reaction of the Axis forces defending northern France.

Caesar, in effective control of the kingdom, sentences <a href="/wiki/Pothinus" title="Pothinus">Pothinus</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gregoire_Aslan" title="Gregoire Aslan">Gregoire Aslan</a>) to death for arranging an assassination attempt on Cleopatra, and banishes Ptolemy to the eastern desert, where he and his outnumbered army would face certain death against <a href="/wiki/Mithridates_III_of_Parthia" title="Mithridates III of Parthia">Mithridates</a>. Cleopatra is crowned <a href="/wiki/Ptolemaic_Kingdom#Final_years_of_the_empire" title="Ptolemaic Kingdom">Queen of Egypt</a>, and begins to develop megalomaniacal dreams of ruling the world with Caesar, who in turn desires to become King of <a href="/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>. They marry, and when their son <a href="/wiki/Caesarion" title="Caesarion">Caesarion</a> is born, Caesar accepts him publicly, which becomes the talk of Rome and the <a href="/wiki/Roman_Senate" title="Roman Senate">Senate</a>.
</p><p>After he is made <a href="/wiki/Roman_dictator" title="Roman dictator">dictator</a> for life, Caesar sends for Cleopatra. She arrives in Rome in a lavish procession and wins the adulation of the Roman people. The Senate grows increasingly discontented amid rumors that Caesar wishes to be made king, which is anathema to the Romans. On the <a href="/wiki/Ides_of_March" title="Ides of March">Ides of March</a> in 44 BC, a group of conspirators <a href="/wiki/Assassination_of_Julius_Caesar" title="Assassination of Julius Caesar">assassinate Caesar</a> and flee the city, starting a rebellion. An <a href="/wiki/Second_Triumvirate" title="Second Triumvirate">alliance</a> between <a href="/wiki/Augustus" title="Augustus">Octavian</a>, Caesar's adopted son, <a href="/wiki/Mark_Antony" title="Mark Antony">Mark Antony</a> (<a href="/wiki/Richard_Burton" title="Richard Burton">Richard Burton</a>), Caesar's right-hand man and general as well as <a href="/wiki/Marcus_Aemilius_Lepidus_(triumvir)" title="Marcus Aemilius Lepidus (triumvir)">Marcus Ameilius Lepidus</a> put down the rebellion and split up the republic between themselves. Cleopatra is angered after Caesar's will recognizes Octavian instead of Caesarion as his official heir, and angrily returns to Egypt.
</p><p>While planning a campaign against <a href="/wiki/Parthian_Empire" title="Parthian Empire">Parthia</a> in the east, Antony realizes he needs money and supplies, and cannot get enough from anywhere but Egypt. After refusing several times to leave Egypt, Cleopatra gives in and meets him in <a href="/wiki/Tarsus,_Mersin" title="Tarsus, Mersin">Tarsus</a>. The two begin a love affair, with Cleopatra assuring Antony that he is much more than a pale reflection of Caesar.
</p><p>Octavian's removal of Lepidus forces Antony to return to Rome, where he marries Octavian's sister, <a href="/wiki/Octavia_the_Younger" title="Octavia the Younger">Octavia</a>, to prevent conflict, upsetting and enraging Cleopatra. Antony and Cleopatra reconcile and marry, with Antony divorcing Octavia. Octavian, incensed, reads Antony's will to the Roman senate, revealing that the latter wishes to be buried in Egypt. Rome turns against Antony, and Octavian's call for war against Egypt receives a rapturous response.
</p><p>The war is decided at the naval <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_Actium" title="Battle of Actium">Battle of Actium</a> on September 2, 31 BC, where Octavian's fleet, under the command of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Agrippa,_Marcus_Vipsanius" title="Agrippa, Marcus Vipsanius">Agrippa</a>, defeats the Antony-Egyptian fleet. Cleopatra assumes Antony is dead and orders the Egyptian forces home. Antony follows, leaving his fleet leaderless and soon defeated.
</p><p>Several months later, Cleopatra manages to convince Antony to resume command of his troops and fight Octavian's advancing army. However, Antony's soldiers abandon him during the night; <a href="/wiki/Rufio_(officer_of_Caesar)" title="Rufio (officer of Caesar)">Rufio</a> (<a href="/wiki/Martin_Landau" title="Martin Landau">Martin Landau</a>), the last man loyal to Antony, kills himself. Antony tries to goad Octavian into single combat, but is finally forced to flee into the city.
</p><p>When Antony returns to the palace, <a href="/wiki/Apollodorus_the_Sicilian" title="Apollodorus the Sicilian">Apollodorus</a>, not believing that Antony is worthy of his queen, convinces him that she is dead, whereupon Antony falls on his own sword. Apollodorus then confesses that he misled Antony and assists him to the tomb where Cleopatra and two servants have taken refuge. Antony dies in Cleopatra's arms.
</p><p>Octavian and his army march into <a href="/wiki/Alexandria" title="Alexandria">Alexandria</a> with Caesarion's dead body in a wagon. He discovers the dead body of Apollodorus, who had poisoned himself. Octavian receives word that Antony is dead and Cleopatra is holed up in a tomb. There he offers her his word that he will allow her to rule Egypt as a Roman province in return for her agreeing to accompany him to Rome. Cleopatra knows her son is dead and agrees to Octavian's terms, including a pledge not to harm herself.
</p><p>After Octavian departs, she orders her servants in coded language to assist with her suicide. Octavian realizes that she is going to kill herself and he and his guards burst into Cleopatra's chamber and find her dressed in gold, and dead, along with her servants, while an <a href="/wiki/Asp_(reptile)" title="Asp (reptile)">asp</a> crawls along the floor.
</p><p>Seeking to exact revenge on James Bond (007) for killing its agent Dr. No and destroying the organisation's assets in the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, the international criminal organisation <a href="/wiki/SPECTRE" title="SPECTRE">SPECTRE</a> begins training agents to kill Bond. Their star pupil is Donald "Red" Grant, an Irish assassin who proves his mettle by killing a Bond impostor in 1 minute and 52 seconds on a training course with a garrote wire concealed in his wristwatch.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the organisation's chief planner, a <a href="/wiki/Czechoslovak_Socialist_Republic" title="Czechoslovak Socialist Republic">Czech</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chess_grandmaster" title="Chess grandmaster">chess grandmaster</a> named Kronsteen (Number 5), devises a plan to play British and Soviet intelligence against each other to procure a Lektor <a href="/wiki/Cryptography" title="Cryptography">cryptographic</a> device from the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviets</a>. SPECTRE's chief executive, <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld" title="Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Number 1</a>, puts <a href="/wiki/Rosa_Klebb" title="Rosa Klebb">Rosa Klebb</a> (Number 3), a former colonel of <a href="/wiki/SMERSH" title="SMERSH">SMERSH</a> (the counter-intelligence branch of Soviet Intelligence) who has defected to SPECTRE in the West, in charge of the mission as chief of operations. Klebb chooses Grant to protect Bond until he acquires the Lektor and then to eliminate 007 and steal the cipher machine for SPECTRE. As part of the scheme, Klebb recruits the beautiful <a href="/wiki/Tatiana_Romanova" title="Tatiana Romanova">Tatiana Romanova</a>, a cipher clerk at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/USSR" title="USSR">Soviet</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Consulate" title="Consulate">consulate</a> in <a href="/wiki/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, who believes the ex-colonel is still  working for SMERSH.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" title="M (James Bond)">M</a> informs Bond that Romanova has contacted their "Station 'T'" in Turkey, claiming to have fallen in love with Bond from his file photo. She offers to defect to the West, and will bring a top-secret Lektor with her to sweeten the deal, but only on the condition that Bond handle her case, personally. Prior to his departure, Bond is supplied by <a href="/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)" title="Q (James Bond)">Q</a> with an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Attach%C3%A9_case" title="Attaché case">attaché case</a> containing a concealed throwing knife, gold sovereigns, a special <a href="/wiki/Tear_gas" title="Tear gas">tear gas</a> booby trap connected to the lock mechanism, and ammunition for an included <a href="/wiki/ArmaLite_AR-7" title="ArmaLite AR-7">ArmaLite AR-7</a> folding sniper rifle with an infrared night scope.
</p><p>After travelling to Istanbul, Bond heads into the city to meet with station head <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_allies_in_From_Russia_with_Love#Ali_Kerim_Bey" title="List of James Bond allies in From Russia with Love">Ali Kerim Bey</a>, tailed by <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Bulgaria" title="People's Republic of Bulgaria">Bulgarian</a> secret agents working for the Russians. They are in turn tailed by Grant, who kills one of them after Bond is taken back to his hotel, stealing their car and dumping it outside the Soviet Consulate to provoke hostilities between British and Soviet Intelligence. In response, the Soviets bomb Kerim's office with a <a href="/wiki/Limpet_mine" title="Limpet mine">limpet mine</a>; Kerim, however, is away from his desk for a tryst with his mistress.  Bond and he then investigate the attack by spying on a Soviet consulate meeting through a periscope installed in the underground aqueducts beneath Istanbul. Thus, they learn that the Soviet agent Krilencu is responsible for the bombing. Kerim Bey declares it unwise to stay in the city under such circumstances and takes Bond to a rural <a href="/wiki/Romani_people" title="Romani people">gypsy</a> settlement. However, Krilencu learns of this and promptly attacks a gypsy feast, where Bond and Kerim are honoured guests, with a band of hired Bulgarian fighters. Much to Bond's confusion, he is saved from an enemy fighter during the attack by a distant sniper shot from Grant. The following night, Bond and Kerim Bey track Krilencu to his hideout, where Kerim Bey kills him with Bond's rifle.
</p><p>Upon returning to his hotel suite that night, Bond finds Romanova waiting for him in his bed and has sex with her; neither is aware that SPECTRE is filming them. The next day, Romanova heads off for a prearranged rendezvous at <a href="/wiki/Hagia_Sophia" title="Hagia Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a> to drop off the floor plans for the consulate, with Grant ensuring Bond receives the plans by killing the other Bulgarian tail who attempts to intercept the drop. Using the plans, Bond and Kerim Bey successfully steal the Lektor, and together with Romanova, escape with the device onto the <i><a href="/wiki/Orient_Express" title="Orient Express">Orient Express</a></i>. On the train, Kerim Bey quickly notices a Soviet security officer named Benz tailing them, prompting him and Bond to subdue him. When Bond leaves Benz and Kerim Bey alone together, Grant kills them and makes it appear as though they killed each other, preventing Bond from leaving the train with Romanova to rendezvous with one of Kerim's men.
</p><p>At the railway station in <a href="/wiki/Belgrade" title="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, Bond passes on word of Kerim Bey's death to one of his sons, and asks for an agent from <a href="/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia" title="Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">Station Y</a> to meet him at <a href="/wiki/Zagreb" title="Zagreb">Zagreb</a>. However, when the train arrives at the station, Grant intercepts Nash, sent from Station Y, killing the agent before posing as him. After drugging Romanova at dinner, Grant overpowers Bond before taunting him about SPECTRE's involvement in the theft. After disclosing that Romanova was unaware of what was truly going on, believing she was working for Russia, Grant reveals to Bond his plans to leave behind the film SPECTRE took of him and Romanova at the hotel, along with a forged blackmail letter, to make it appear that their deaths were the result of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Murder-suicide" title="Murder-suicide">murder-suicide</a>, to scandalise the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_intelligence_community" title="British intelligence community">intelligence community</a>. Bond quickly convinces him to accept a bribe of gold sovereigns in exchange for a final cigarette, tricking Grant into setting off the booby trap in his attaché case. This distracts Grant enough for Bond to attack him in a brutal brawl. In the ensuing fight, Bond narrowly gains the upper hand, stabbing Grant with the case's concealed knife before strangling him with his own <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Garrotte" title="Garrotte">garrotte</a>. Bond then drags the barely conscious Romanova from the train, which has been stopped by a SPECTRE accomplice, where he hijacks Grant's getaway truck and flees the scene with Romanova.
</p><p>Upon hearing the news of Grant's death, Number 1 calls Klebb and Kronsteen onto the carpet to explain what went wrong and remind them that SPECTRE does not tolerate failure. Kronsteen is executed by the henchman Morzeny with a kick from the poison-tipped switchblade in his shoe. Klebb, however, is given one last chance to make good on the mission and acquire the Lektor (which has already been promised to the Russians in a sell-back scheme).
</p><p>The next morning, Bond's stolen truck is intercepted along its escape route by a SPECTRE helicopter, but 007 destroys the attacking aircraft by shooting its co-pilot with his sniper rifle, causing the man to drop a live hand grenade in the cockpit. Thus, Bond and Romanova make it to Grant's escape boat on the <a href="/wiki/Dalmatia" title="Dalmatia">Dalmatian coast</a> and steal that, too, only to be pursued by Morzeny, who leads a squadron of SPECTRE powerboats. Bond, however, escapes by dumping his own powerboat's fuel drums overboard and detonating them with a <a href="/wiki/Flare_gun" title="Flare gun">Very flare</a> to engulf all the chase boats in a sea of flames.
</p><p>Eventually, Romanova and he reach a hotel in <a href="/wiki/Venice" title="Venice">Venice</a>, where they believe themselves to be safe. Klebb, however, disguised as a maid, makes one final attempt on Bond and the Lektor. Klebb tries to kick him with a poisoned switchblade shoe, but Romanova shoots her with her own dropped gun. With the mission accomplished, Bond and Romanova leave Venice on a romantic boat ride, in which course Bond throws Grant's blackmail film into the canal.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, Professor Henry Higgins, a scholar of <a href="/wiki/Phonetics" title="Phonetics">phonetics</a>, believes that the accent and tone of one's voice determines a person's prospects in society ("Why Can't the English?"). At <a href="/wiki/Covent_Garden" title="Covent Garden">Covent Garden</a> one evening, he meets Colonel Hugh Pickering, himself a phonetics expert who had come all the way from India to see him. Higgins boasts he could teach anyone to speak so well he could pass them off as a duke or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Duchess" title="Duchess">duchess</a> at an embassy <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ball_(dance)" title="Ball (dance)">ball</a>, even the young woman with a strong <a href="/wiki/Cockney" title="Cockney">Cockney</a> accent named Eliza Doolittle who tries to <a href="/wiki/Flower_seller" title="Flower seller">sell them flowers</a>. Eliza's ambition is to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible ("Wouldn't It Be Loverly"). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins' home, seeking lessons. Pickering is intrigued and offers to cover all the attendant expenses if Higgins succeeds. Higgins agrees, and describes how women ruin lives ("I'm an Ordinary Man").
</p><p>Eliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle, a <a href="/wiki/Waste_collector" title="Waste collector">dustman</a>, learns of his daughter's new residence ("With a Little Bit of Luck"). He shows up at Higgins' house three days later, ostensibly to protect his daughter's virtue, but in reality simply to extract some money from Higgins, and is bought off with £5. Higgins is impressed by the man's honesty, his natural gift for language, and especially his brazen lack of morals. Higgins recommends Alfred to a wealthy American who is interested in morality. 
</p><p>Eliza endures Higgins' demanding teaching methods and treatment of her personally ("Just You Wait"). She makes little progress, but just as she, Higgins, and Pickering are about to give up, Eliza finally "gets it" ("The Rain in Spain"); she instantly begins to speak with an impeccable <a href="/wiki/Received_Pronunciation" title="Received Pronunciation">upper class accent</a> ("I Could Have Danced All Night").
</p><p>As a trial run, Higgins takes her to <a href="/wiki/Ascot_Racecourse" title="Ascot Racecourse">Ascot Racecourse</a> ("Ascot Gavotte"), where she makes a good impression initially, only to shock everyone by a sudden lapse into vulgar Cockney while cheering on a horse. Higgins partly conceals a grin behind his hand. At Ascot, she meets Freddy Eynsford-Hill, a young, upper-class man who becomes infatuated with her ("On the Street Where You Live"). Higgins then takes Eliza to an embassy ball for the final test, where she dances with a foreign prince. Zoltan <a href="/wiki/Carpathian_Mountains" title="Carpathian Mountains">Karpathy</a>, a Hungarian phonetics expert trained by Higgins, who uses his skills to detect and blackmail imposters, dances with Eliza, then declares that she is not who she claims to be, but is Hungarian of royal blood, a princess.
</p><p>However, Eliza's hard work is barely acknowledged, with all the praise going to Higgins ("You Did It").  This and his callous treatment towards her afterwards, especially his indifference to her future, causes her to walk out on him, leaving him mystified by her ingratitude ("Just You Wait (Reprise)"). Outside, Freddy is still waiting ("On the Street Where You Live (Reprise)"), and greets Eliza, who is irritated by him as all he does is talk ("Show Me"). Eliza tries to return to her old life, but finds that she no longer fits in. She meets her father, who has been left a large fortune by the wealthy American to whom Higgins had recommended him, and is resigned to marrying Eliza's stepmother. Alfred feels that Higgins has ruined him, lamenting that he is now bound by "middle-class morality" ("Get Me to the Church On Time"). Eliza eventually ends up visiting Higgins' mother, who is outraged at her son's callous behaviour.
</p><p>The next day, Higgins finds Eliza gone and searches for her ("A Hymn to Him"), eventually finding her at his mother's house. Higgins attempts to talk Eliza into coming back to him. He becomes angered when she announces that she is going to marry Freddy and become Karpathy's assistant ("Without You"). He makes his way home, stubbornly predicting that she will come crawling back. However, he comes to the unsettling realization that she has become an important part of his life ("I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face"). As he listens to a recording of Eliza's voice, she reappears in the doorway behind him, turning off the recording and saying in her old Cockney accent, "I washed my hands and face before I come, I did."  Higgins looks surprised, then pleased, before asking where his slippers are.
</p><p>After destroying a <a href="/wiki/Clandestine_chemistry" title="Clandestine chemistry">drug laboratory</a> in <a href="/wiki/Latin_America" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mi6" title="Mi6">MI6</a> agent James Bond travels to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Miami_Beach" title="Miami Beach">Miami Beach</a> for a vacation.  He receives instructions from his superior, <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" title="M (James Bond)">M</a>, via CIA agent <a href="/wiki/Felix_Leiter" title="Felix Leiter">Felix Leiter</a> to observe bullion dealer <a href="/wiki/Auric_Goldfinger" title="Auric Goldfinger">Auric Goldfinger</a> at the hotel there. Bond sees Goldfinger cheating at <a href="/wiki/Gin_rummy" title="Gin rummy">gin rummy</a> and stops him by distracting his employee, Jill Masterson, and <a href="/wiki/Blackmail" title="Blackmail">blackmailing</a> Goldfinger into losing. After Bond and Jill consummate their new relationship, Bond is knocked out by Goldfinger's <a href="/wiki/North_Korea" title="North Korea">Korean</a> manservant <a href="/wiki/Oddjob" title="Oddjob">Oddjob</a>. When Bond awakens, he finds Jill dead, covered in gold paint, having died from "skin suffocation".
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_the_Bank_of_England" title="Governor of the Bank of England">governor of the Bank of England</a> and M explain to Bond that gold prices vary across the world, allowing one to profit by selling bullion internationally, and his objective is determining how Goldfinger does it by smuggling. To help in his mission, Bond is given a modified <a href="/wiki/Aston_Martin_DB5" title="Aston Martin DB5">Aston Martin DB5</a> and two radar trackers by <a href="/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)" title="Q (James Bond)">Q</a>. Bond arranges to meet Goldfinger socially at his country club in <a href="/wiki/Kent" title="Kent">Kent</a>, and wins a high-stakes <a href="/wiki/Golf" title="Golf">golf</a> game against him with a recovered <a href="/wiki/Nazi_gold" title="Nazi gold">Nazi gold</a> bar at stake. Aware of Bond’s ulterior motives, Goldfinger warns Bond not to interfere in his affairs, reinforcing the threat by having Oddjob demonstrate his steel-rimmed derby as a deadly weapon. Bond follows Goldfinger to <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, where Tilly, Jill's sister, attempts to avenge her sister by assassinating Goldfinger with a rifle and fails.
</p><p>Bond sneaks into Goldfinger's plant and discovers Goldfinger smuggles gold by melting it down and incorporating it into the bodywork of his <a href="/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Phantom_III" title="Rolls-Royce Phantom III">Rolls-Royce Phantom III</a>, which he takes with him whenever he travels. Bond also overhears Goldfinger talking to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="People's Republic of China">Chinese</a> nuclear physicist Mr. Ling about "Operation Grand Slam". Leaving, Bond encounters Tilly as she tries to kill Goldfinger again, but trips an alarm in the process. Oddjob kills Tilly with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oddjob%27s_hat" title="Oddjob's hat">his hat</a>, and Bond is captured and tied to a cutting table underneath an industrial <a href="/wiki/Laser" title="Laser">laser</a>, which begins to slice a large sheet of gold in half, with Bond lying over it. He then lies to Goldfinger that <a href="/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service" title="Secret Intelligence Service">MI6</a> knows about Grand Slam, causing Goldfinger to spare Bond's life to mislead MI6 into believing Bond has things in hand.
</p><p>Bond is transported by Goldfinger's private jet, piloted by <a href="/wiki/Pussy_Galore" title="Pussy Galore">Pussy Galore</a>, to his <a href="/wiki/Stud_farm" title="Stud farm">stud farm</a> in <a href="/wiki/Lexington,_Kentucky" title="Lexington, Kentucky">Lexington,</a> <a href="/wiki/Kentucky" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. Bond escapes and witnesses Goldfinger's meeting with <a href="/wiki/American_Mafia" title="American Mafia">American mafiosi</a>, who have brought the materials he needs for Operation Grand Slam. Goldfinger reveals that his plan is to rob the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Bullion_Depository" title="United States Bullion Depository">U.S. Bullion Depository</a> at <a href="/wiki/Fort_Knox" title="Fort Knox">Fort Knox</a> by releasing <a href="/wiki/Neurotoxin" title="Neurotoxin">Delta 9 nerve gas</a> into the atmosphere. After Bond is recaptured by Pussy, Goldfinger has the mafiosi killed using the gas. 
</p><p>Bond points out to Goldfinger that his plan to rob the depository will not work, as he will not have enough time to move the gold before the Americans intervene. Goldfinger hints he does not intend to steal the gold, and Bond deduces that Goldfinger will detonate a <a href="/wiki/Dirty_bomb" title="Dirty bomb">dirty bomb</a> inside the vault, designed to render the gold useless for 58 years. This will increase the value of Goldfinger's own gold and give the Chinese an advantage from the potential economic chaos. Goldfinger subtly threatens that should the Americans attempt to locate the bomb or interfere with his plan, he will simply have it detonated somewhere else of significance in the United States. 
</p><p>Operation Grand Slam begins with Pussy Galore's Flying Circus spraying the gas over Fort Knox, seemingly killing all of the military and government personnel nearby including Felix. Goldfinger's private army breaks into Fort Knox and accesses the vault as Goldfinger arrives in a helicopter with the atomic device. In the vault, his henchman Kisch handcuffs Bond to the bomb. Unbeknownst to Goldfinger however, Bond has convinced Galore to alert the Americans and replace the gas with a harmless substance. The troops arise and attack, killing many of Goldfinger's men. Seeing this, Goldfinger locks the vault, takes off his coat, revealing a US Army colonel's uniform, and kills Mr. Ling and several troops, before escaping. Kisch realizes they are trapped and attempts to stop the bomb, but Oddjob throws him to his death. Bond frees himself with Kisch's handcuff keys, but the superhumanly strong Oddjob batters him before he can disarm the bomb. Eventually Bond manages to electrocute Oddjob, then forces the lock off the bomb using gold bullion bars from the vault, but ultimately is unable to disarm it. After finally killing all of Goldfinger's men, the troops open the vault and rush to disarm the bomb. An atomic specialist who accompanied Leiter arrives with seconds to spare, and simply turns off the device with the timer stopped on "0:07".
</p><p>Bond is invited to the <a href="/wiki/White_House" title="White House">White House</a> for lunch with the President. However, Goldfinger hijacks the plane carrying Bond there. In a struggle for Goldfinger's revolver, the gun fires, shooting out a window, creating an <a href="/wiki/Uncontrolled_decompression#Explosive_decompression" title="Uncontrolled decompression">explosive decompression</a>. Goldfinger is blown out of the cabin through the ruptured window. With the plane out of control, Bond rescues Galore and they parachute safely from the aircraft before it crashes into the ocean. A search helicopter passes, but Bond claims “this is no time to be rescued” and draws the parachute over himself and Galore.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Edwardian_era" title="Edwardian era">Edwardian</a> <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, 1910, Bert entertains a crowd as a <a href="/wiki/One-man_band" title="One-man band">one-man band</a> when he senses a change in the wind. Afterwards, he <a href="/wiki/Fourth_wall" title="Fourth wall">directly addresses the audience</a>, and gives them a tour of Cherry Tree Lane, stopping outside the Banks family's home. George Banks returns home to learn from his wife, Winifred, that Katie Nanna has left their service after Jane and Michael ran away again. They are returned shortly after by Constable Jones, who reveals the children were chasing a lost kite. The children ask their father to help build a better kite, but he dismisses them. Taking it upon himself to hire a new nanny, Mr. Banks advertises for a stern, no-nonsense nanny. Instead, Jane and Michael present their own advertisement for a kinder, sweeter nanny. Mr. Banks rips up the letter, and throws the scraps in the fireplace, but the remains of the advertisement magically float up, and out into the air.
</p><p>The next day, a number of elderly, sour-faced nannies wait outside the Banks' home, but a strong gust of wind blows them away, and Jane and Michael witness a young nanny descending from the sky using her umbrella. Presenting herself to Mr. Banks, <a href="/wiki/Mary_Poppins_(character)" title="Mary Poppins (character)">Mary Poppins</a> calmly produces the children's restored advertisement, and agrees with its requests, but promises the astonished banker she will be firm with his children. As Mr. Banks puzzles over the advertisement's return, Mary Poppins hires herself, and convinces him it was originally his idea. She meets the children, then helps them magically tidy their nursery through song, before heading out for a walk in the park.
</p><p>Outside, they meet Bert, working as a <a href="/wiki/Street_painting" title="Street painting">screever</a>; Mary Poppins uses her magic to transport the group into one of his drawings. While the children ride on a <a href="/wiki/Carousel" title="Carousel">carousel</a>, Mary Poppins and Bert go on a leisurely stroll. Mary Poppins later enchants the carousel horses, and participates in a horse race, which she wins. While being asked to describe her victory, Mary Poppins announces the nonsense word "<a href="/wiki/Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious" title="Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious">Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious</a>". However, the outing is ruined when a thunderstorm dissolves Bert's drawings, returning the group to London.
</p><p>On another outing, the four meet weird Uncle Albert, who has floated up in the air due to his uncontrollable laughter; they join him for a tea party on the ceiling by telling jokes.
</p><p>Mr. Banks becomes annoyed by the household's cheery atmosphere, and threatens to fire Mary Poppins. Instead, Mary Poppins inverts his attempt by convincing him to take the children to the bank for a day. Mr. Banks takes Jane and Michael to the bank, where they meet Mr. Dawes Sr, and his son. Mr. Dawes aggressively attempts to have Michael invest his <a href="/wiki/Twopence_(British_pre-decimal_coin)" title="Twopence (British pre-decimal coin)">tuppence</a> in the bank, snatching it from him. Michael demands it back, causing other customers to misinterpret, and all demand their own money back, causing a <a href="/wiki/Bank_run" title="Bank run">bank run</a>.
</p><p>Jane and Michael flee the bank, getting lost in the <a href="/wiki/East_End_of_London" title="East End of London">East End</a> until they run into Bert, now working as a <a href="/wiki/Chimney_sweep" title="Chimney sweep">chimney sweep</a>, who escorts them home. The three and Mary Poppins venture onto the rooftops, where they have a song-and-dance number with other chimney sweeps, which spills out into the Banks' home. An incensed Mr. Banks returns, and receives a phone call from his employers. He speaks with Bert, who tells him he should spend more time with his children before they grow up. Jane and Michael give their father Michael's tuppence in the hope to make amends.
</p><p>Mr. Banks walks through London to the bank, where he is given a humiliating <a href="/wiki/Cashiering" title="Cashiering">cashiering</a>, and is dismissed. Looking to the tuppence for words, he blurts out "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!", tells one of Uncle Albert's jokes, and happily heads home. Dawes mulls over the joke, but finally "gets" it, and floats up into the air, laughing.
</p><p>The next day, the wind changes, meaning Mary Poppins must leave. A happier Mr. Banks is found at home, having fixed his children's kite, and takes the family out to fly it. In the park, the Banks family meets Mr. Dawes Jr, who reveals his father <a href="/wiki/Death_from_laughter" title="Death from laughter">died laughing</a> from the joke. Although initially sorry, Mr. Banks soon becomes happy for him, as Mr. Dawes Jr. had never seen his father happier in his life and re-employs Mr. Banks as a junior partner. With her work done, Mary Poppins flies away, with Bert bidding her farewell, telling her not to stay away too long.
</p><p>In 1938, Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman studying to become a nun at <a href="/wiki/Nonnberg_Abbey" title="Nonnberg Abbey">Nonnberg Abbey</a> in <a href="/wiki/Salzburg" title="Salzburg">Salzburg</a>. Her love of music and the mountains, her youthful enthusiasm and imagination, and her lack of discipline cause some concern among the nuns. The Mother Abbess, believing Maria would be happier outside the abbey, sends her to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children—Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. Liesl, the oldest, is won over after Maria protects her from discovery when she is nearly caught sneaking back into the house after meeting with Rolfe, a messenger boy she is in love with.
</p><p>While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children and takes them around Salzburg and the surrounding mountains, and teaches them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend, Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake that concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities, and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain orders her to return to the abbey. Just then he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. Afterwards, he apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay.
</p><p>Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes he enter them in the upcoming <a href="/wiki/Salzburg_Festival" title="Salzburg Festival">Salzburg Festival</a> but the suggestion is immediately rejected by the Captain as he is opposed to his children singing in public. He does agree, however, to organize a grand party at the villa. The night of the party, while guests in formal attire <a href="/wiki/Waltz" title="Waltz">waltz</a> in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional <i><a href="/wiki/L%C3%A4ndler" title="Ländler">Ländler</a></i> folk dance, he cuts in and dances with Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy while convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. Back at the abbey, when Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her life. After Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. The Captain's feelings for Maria, however, have not changed, and after breaking off his engagement the Captain marries Maria.
</p><p>While the Captain and Maria are on their honeymoon, Max enters the children in the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. When they learn that Austria has been annexed by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Third_Reich" title="Third Reich">Third Reich</a> in the <i><a href="/wiki/Anschluss" title="Anschluss">Anschluss</a></i>, the couple return to their home, where a telegram awaits informing the Captain that he must report to the German Naval base at <a href="/wiki/Bremerhaven" title="Bremerhaven">Bremerhaven</a> to accept a commission in the <a href="/wiki/Kriegsmarine" title="Kriegsmarine">German Navy</a>. Strongly opposed to the Nazis and the <i>Anschluss</i>, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately for <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. Many of the Von Trapps' friends are prepared to accept the new regime, including Rolfe, whom Liesl is devastated to see has joined the <a href="/wiki/Hitler_Youth" title="Hitler Youth">Hitler Youth</a>. That night, as the von Trapp family attempt to leave, they are stopped by a group of <a href="/wiki/Sturmabteilung" title="Sturmabteilung">Brownshirts</a> waiting outside the villa. When questioned by <i><a href="/wiki/Gauleiter" title="Gauleiter">Gauleiter</a></i> Hans Zeller, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven.
</p><p>Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slip away and seek shelter at the nearby abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Brownshirts soon arrive and search the abbey, and the family is discovered by Rolfe. Upon seeing Liesl, he hesitates raising the alarm long enough to allow the family time to flee, and the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When the soldiers attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start as two nuns have removed parts of the engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom.
</p><p>The film<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[8]</a></sup> consists of five main sections: <a href="/wiki/Genesis_creation_narrative" title="Genesis creation narrative">The Creation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Adam_and_Eve" title="Adam and Eve">Adam and Eve</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cain_and_Abel" title="Cain and Abel">Cain and Abel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Noah%27s_Ark" title="Noah's Ark">Noah's Ark</a>, and the story of <a href="/wiki/Abraham" title="Abraham">Abraham</a>. There are also a pair of shorter sections, one recounting the building of the <a href="/wiki/Tower_of_Babel" title="Tower of Babel">Tower of Babel</a>, and the other the destruction of <a href="/wiki/Sodom_and_Gomorrah" title="Sodom and Gomorrah">Sodom and Gomorrah</a>. The sections vary greatly in tone. The story of Abraham is somber and reverential, while that of Noah repeatedly focuses on his love of all animals. Cats (including lions) are shown drinking milk and Noah's relationship with the animals is depicted as harmonious. It was originally conceived as the first in a series of films retelling the entire <a href="/wiki/Old_Testament" title="Old Testament">Old Testament</a>, but these sequels were never made.
</p><p>In 1819, young Prince Keoki Kanakoa from the <a href="/wiki/Hawaiian_Islands" title="Hawaiian Islands">Islands of Hawaii</a> makes an appeal at the <a href="/wiki/Yale_Divinity_School" title="Yale Divinity School">Yale Divinity School</a> for newly graduated ministers to return with him to Hawaii and convert the natives to Christianity. Reverend Abner Hale is among those who volunteer for the mission. Before being sent to Hawaii, the young ministers must marry — a problem for Abner as he has zealously devoted himself to his studies and does not know any marriageable young women, partly because he has been raised in a strict, cold <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Calvinist" title="Calvinist">Calvinist</a> household where romance or pleasure, even between a married couple, is considered sinful. The head of the school, Reverend Dr. Thorn, introduces Abner to his niece, Jerusha Bromley, a beautiful and pious New England girl who has been pining for Captain Rafer Hoxworth, a whaler who has been at sea for two years and has not written to her. Although Jerusha's parents are not enthused about her marrying the awkward Abner, her uncle persuades them to give him a chance, and also hides the package of letters from Hoxworth that appear at the Bromley home just as Abner arrives. 
</p><p>Abner is stunned by Jerusha's beauty, and attracted to her despite his attempts to avoid what he considers sinful thoughts, but he completely lacks social graces and makes one embarrassing gaffe after another. Despite this, Jerusha encourages him, and he finally proposes and she accepts, with the understanding that they will both be going on mission to Hawaii. The Hales depart for Hawaii with the other missionaries and Keoki, and after a harrowing sea voyage during which all but Abner are very seasick and the ship almost wrecks going around <a href="/wiki/Cape_Horn" title="Cape Horn">Cape Horn</a> in southern <a href="/wiki/Chile" title="Chile">Chile</a>, they arrive in Keoki's hometown of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lahaina" title="Lahaina">Lahaina</a>, <a href="/wiki/Maui" title="Maui">Maui</a>, where they stop before most of the missionaries continue on to the main church at <a href="/wiki/Honolulu" title="Honolulu">Honolulu</a>. The missionaries are horrified to see what they consider the islanders' sinful ways. Naked young girls swim out to meet the ships and have sexual relations with the sailors; monuments are dedicated to the traditional gods; and Keoki's father Kelolo is both the husband and the biological brother of Keoki's mother Malama Kanakoa, the <a href="/wiki/Ali%CA%BBi" title="Aliʻi">Aliʻi Nui</a> (ruler) whom the natives consider a "sacred person". The Ali'i Nui must marry her brother to avoid polluting the bloodline of the ruling family, and Keoki is expected to also marry his sister Noelani when she succeeds Malama as Ali'i Nui. However, Keoki is willing to forego this in order to become what he truly wants to be, an ordained Christian minister. 
</p><p>Malama takes a liking to Jerusha and demands that Jerusha teach her to write English, so she can communicate with the outside world. Malama agrees to learn about the Christian God, but only after she learns to write. When the other missionaries continue on to Honolulu, the Hales stay behind, living in an uncomfortable hut and building a church. Jerusha tries to change the villagers' tradition of killing unwanted or deformed babies, personally rescuing one baby who has a birthmark. Jerusha goes through a difficult labor to give birth to her own healthy son, tended only by the inexperienced Abner (who excludes the native midwives) and afterwards Abner confesses to her his great love for her, a love he normally feels is sinful and tries to suppress. Abner baptizes his first convert, a young Hawaiian girl named Iliki who works as a servant for the Hales. However, he makes excuses to defer ordaining Keoki as a minister; in reality, he and his superiors have no intentions of ordaining any natives. Keoki eventually realizes that he will never be permitted to become a minister, despite having studied for years, including at Yale. He becomes disillusioned with Christianity as a result.
</p><p>Malama, who is a kind, loving and intelligent woman underneath her imperious facade, agrees to learn about Christianity, but will not take the final step to convert because she will have to send away Kelolo, her beloved husband of many years who is also her brother. At the Hales' urging, she enacts a curfew for sailors and forbids girls from swimming out to the ships. The sailors in port riot in protest, led by Captain Hoxworth, who has made a stop on his long whaling voyage. In the midst of the melee, Hoxworth discovers that the love of his life, Jerusha, is in Lahaina and is now the wife of Reverend Hale, whom he already despises for inspiring Malama to enact the restrictions. The sailors partially torch the church, but the Hawaiians help the Hales put out the fire and then chase the sailors back to their ships. To console himself over Jerusha, Hoxworth entices Iliki to sail away with him, and knocks Abner overboard when he comes after her. 
</p><p>Malama, on her deathbed, agrees to renounce Kelolo and is baptized a Christian right before she dies while saying a final goodbye to Kelolo. Upon the death of the Ali'i Nui, as predicted by the natives, a strong wind begins to blow, destroying the church building (which Abner refused to build in a way that the villagers suggested to let the wind pass through). Soon after her death, Abner hears drums and discovers Kelolo conducting a marriage ceremony for Keoki and Noelani, the new Ali'i Nui. Keoki, rejected as a minister, has turned back to the traditional gods. Keoki also reveals that while his mother Malama agreed to become a Christian in order to set an example for her people, whom she realized must become Christians for their own good as more and more white settlers arrive, she secretly asked that after she was buried in the Christian graveyard, her family move her bones to an undisclosed location where she can be with the old gods, and that Kelolo take her heart back to <a href="/wiki/Bora_Bora" title="Bora Bora">Bora Bora</a>, the land of their ancestors. Horrified and enraged, Abner curses the Kanakoa family and the other Hawaiians and tells them God will punish them for their sins. 
</p><p>Noelani, pregnant by Keoki, gives birth to a horribly deformed baby who cannot be accepted as Ali'i Nui. Jerusha begs Abner to intercede to save the baby, whom she fears will be killed, but he refuses, saying it is God's punishment for Keoki's and Noelani's sin. Keoki drowns the baby in the ocean, causing a rift between Abner and Jerusha. Shortly afterwards, a sailor carries measles into the port of Lahaina. While this is a relatively minor childhood illness to the missionaries and sailors, the native Hawaiians have no resistance, develop high fevers and die in droves. Keoki dies in Abner's arms in a feverish delirium, renouncing God. Abner returns home wracked by sadness and guilt, feeling that he failed in his mission to save Keoki and the other natives from hell. Jerusha, who is worn out from overwork in the hot climate, giving birth to three children, and nursing the sick Hawaiians, tells him that she does not believe God would send loving people like the Hawaiians to hell even if they weren't Christians, and furthermore tells Abner he can help the Hawaiians by giving them what he has always had difficulty giving her - his love. Jerusha soon dies, mourned by Abner, her children, and Captain Hoxworth, who never got over losing her to Abner. 
</p><p>After Jerusha's death, Abner becomes more loving towards the Hawaiians and works with them to try to prevent white settlers and plantation owners from taking their land. His position is at odds with the other ministers, who have recently voted that it is time for the churches to own land themselves and try to make money from it, something the ministers had avoided before. Abner is reassigned back to New England and his Lahaina church is given to another minister. But Abner refuses to leave Lahaina and says he will stay and continue to preach, in the street if necessary, and without any support from the church organization. He does agree to send the three Hale children back to New England to live with the Bromleys and receive a proper education. After bidding his children goodbye at the dock, Abner returns to his hut to find that a young Hawaiian man has arrived who wishes to be his assistant and help him, something the aging, frail Abner very much needs. He is overjoyed to see that the young man is the baby with the birthmark, now grown to an adult, whom Jerusha saved from being killed many years ago.
</p><p>The film centers on the volatile marriage of a middle-aged couple: George, an associate history professor at a small <a href="/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a> college, and Martha, the daughter of the university president. After they return home drunk from a party, Martha reveals she has invited a young married couple, whom she had met at the party, for a drink. The guests arrive – Nick, a biology professor (whom Martha mistakenly believes to be a math professor), and his wife, Honey – at 2:30 am. As the four drink, Martha and George engage in scathing verbal abuse in front of Nick and Honey. The younger couple is first embarrassed and later enmeshed
</p><p>The wives briefly separate from the husbands, and upon their return, Honey reveals that Martha has told her about her and George's son, adding that she understands that the following day (Sunday) will mark his sixteenth birthday. George is visibly angry that Martha has divulged this information.
</p><p>Martha taunts George aggressively and he retaliates with his usual passive aggression. Martha tells an embarrassing story about how she humiliated him in front of her father. Martha's taunts continue, and George reacts violently by breaking a bottle. Nick and Honey become increasingly unsettled, and Honey, who has had too much brandy, and has just been whirled violently around the room by George while chanting "Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?" (to the tune of "<a href="/wiki/Here_We_Go_Round_the_Mulberry_Bush" title="Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush">Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush</a>"), runs to the bathroom to vomit.
</p><p>Martha goes to the kitchen to make coffee, and George and Nick go outside. The younger man confesses he was attracted to Honey more for her family's money than passion, and married her only because he mistakenly believed she was pregnant. George describes his own marriage as one of never-ending accommodation and adjustment, then admits he considers Nick a threat. George also tells a story about a boy he grew up with who had accidentally killed his mother and years later, his father, and ended up living out his days in a mental hospital. Nick admits he aims to charm and sleep his way to the top, and jokes that Martha would be a good place to start.
</p><p>When their guests propose leaving, George insists on driving them home, despite his inebriated state. They approach a <a href="/wiki/Roadhouse_(facility)" title="Roadhouse (facility)">roadhouse</a>, and Honey suggests they stop to dance. While Honey and George watch, Nick suggestively dances with Martha, who continues to mock and criticize George. George unplugs the jukebox and announces the game is over. In response, Martha alludes to the fact he may have murdered his parents like the protagonist in his unpublished, <a href="/wiki/Non-fiction_novel" title="Non-fiction novel">non-fiction novel</a>, prompting George to attack Martha until Nick pulls him away from her. George tells the group about a second novel he allegedly has written about a young couple from the Midwest, a good-looking teacher and his timid wife, who marry because of her <a href="/wiki/False_pregnancy" title="False pregnancy">hysterical pregnancy</a> and money, then settle in a small college town. An embarrassed Honey realizes Nick indiscreetly told George about their past and runs from the room. Nick promises revenge on George, and then runs after Honey.
</p><p>In the parking lot, George tells his wife he cannot stand the way she constantly humiliates him, and she tauntingly accuses him of having married her for just that reason. Their rage erupts into a declaration of "total war". Martha drives off, retrieving Nick and Honey, leaving George to make his way back home on foot. When he arrives home, he discovers the car crashed on the drive and Honey half conscious on the back seat and sees Martha and Nick together through the bedroom window. Through Honey's drunken babbling, George begins to suspect that her pregnancy was in fact real, and that she secretly had an <a href="/wiki/Abortion" title="Abortion">abortion</a>. He then devises a plan to get back at Martha.
</p><p>When Martha accuses Nick of being sexually inadequate, he blames his lack of performance on all the liquor he has consumed. George then appears holding snapdragons, which he throws at Martha and Nick in another game.  He mentions his and Martha's son, prompting her to reminisce about his birth and childhood and how he was nearly destroyed by his father. George accuses Martha of engaging in destructive and abusive behavior with the boy, who frequently ran away to escape her attention. George then announces he has received a telegram with bad news—their son has been killed in a car accident. 
</p><p>As Martha begs George not to "kill" their son, Nick suddenly realizes the truth: Martha and George had never been able to have children, and filled the void with an imaginary son. By declaring their son dead, accordingly, George has "killed" him. George explains that their one mutually-agreed-upon rule was to never mention the "existence" of their son to anyone else, and that he "killed" him because Martha broke that rule by mentioning him to Honey.
</p><p>The young couple departs quietly, and George and Martha are left alone as the day begins to break outside. George starts singing the song "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?", and Martha responds, "I am, George, I am."

Bagheera speaks to Baloo that night and convinces him that the jungle will never be safe for Mowgli so long as Shere Khan is there. In the morning, Baloo reluctantly explains to Mowgli that the Man-Village is best for the boy, but Mowgli accuses him of breaking his promise and runs away. As Baloo sets off in search of Mowgli, Bagheera rallies the help of Hathi and his patrol. However, Shere Khan himself, who was eavesdropping on Bagheera and Hathi's conversation, is now determined to hunt and kill Mowgli himself.

</p><p>In 1967, Benjamin Braddock, aged 21, has earned his bachelor's degree from a college on the East Coast and has returned home to a party celebrating his graduation at his parents' house in suburban <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>. Benjamin, visibly uncomfortable as his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans, evades those who try to congratulate him. Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's law partner, insists that he drive her home. Benjamin is coerced inside to have a drink and Mrs. Robinson attempts to seduce him. She invites him up to her daughter Elaine's room to see her portrait and then enters the room naked, making it clear that she is available to him. Benjamin initially rebuffs her but a few days later, he clumsily organizes a tryst at the Taft Hotel.
</p><p>Benjamin spends the remainder of the summer drifting around in the pool by day, purposefully neglecting to select a graduate school, and seeing Mrs. Robinson at the hotel by night. He discovers that he and Mrs. Robinson have nothing to talk about. However, after Benjamin pesters her one evening, Mrs. Robinson reveals that she entered into a loveless marriage when she accidentally became pregnant with Elaine. Both Mr. Robinson and Benjamin's parents encourage him to call Elaine, but, in private, Mrs. Robinson forbids it.
</p><p>Benjamin takes Elaine on a date but tries to sabotage it by ignoring her, driving recklessly and taking her to a strip club. After Elaine runs out of the strip club in tears, Benjamin has a change of heart, realizes how rude he has been to her, and discovers that Elaine is someone with whom he is comfortable. In search of a late-night drink they visit the Taft Hotel, but when the staff greet Benjamin as "Mr. Gladstone" (the name he uses during his trysts with Mrs. Robinson) Elaine correctly guesses that he has been having an affair with a married woman and accepts his assurances that the affair is now over. To preempt a furious Mrs. Robinson, who threatens to tell Elaine her version of their affair, Benjamin tells Elaine that the married woman was her mother. Elaine is distraught and returns to school at <a href="/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley" title="University of California, Berkeley">Berkeley</a>. Benjamin pursues her there and tries to talk to her. She reveals that her mother's story is that he raped her while she was drunk, and she refuses to believe that her mother actually seduced Benjamin. After pestering her to marry him for several days, Benjamin begins to make inroads with Elaine. However, Mr. Robinson arrives at Berkeley after learning about the affair, confronts Benjamin at his rooming house, and threatens to put him behind bars if Benjamin sees his daughter again. Mr. Robinson then forces Elaine to drop out of college and takes her away to marry Carl, a classmate with whom she briefly had been involved.
</p><p>Returning to Pasadena in search of Elaine, Benjamin breaks into the Robinson home but encounters Mrs. Robinson. She tells him he will not be able to stop the wedding with Carl and then calls the police, claiming that her house is being burgled. Benjamin visits Carl's fraternity brothers who tell him that the wedding is in <a href="/wiki/Santa_Barbara,_California" title="Santa Barbara, California">Santa Barbara</a> that very morning. He rushes to the church and arrives just as Elaine is married, witnessing the kiss. He bangs on the glass at the back of the church and screams "Elaine!" repeatedly. After hesitating, Elaine screams "Ben!" and looks at him plaintively. He rushes toward her, and a brawl ensues as guests try to stop the two from leaving together. Elaine manages to break free from her mother, who then slaps her. Benjamin manages to keep the guests at bay by jamming a large cross into the doors of the church. Both he and Elaine then run into the street to flag down a passing bus and take the back seat. Although initially elated at their victory, the pair become increasingly uncomfortable as they journey towards an uncertain future.

Sunlight strikes the monolith and a loud high-pitched radio signal is heard.
</p><p>Eighteen months later, the United States spacecraft <i><a href="/wiki/Discovery_One" title="Discovery One">Discovery One</a></i> is bound for <a href="/wiki/Jupiter" title="Jupiter">Jupiter</a>. On board are mission pilots and scientists Dr. David Bowman and Dr. Frank Poole, along with three other scientists in <a href="/wiki/Suspended_animation" title="Suspended animation">suspended animation</a>. Most of <i>Discovery</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s operations are controlled by the ship's computer, a <a href="/wiki/HAL_9000" title="HAL 9000">HAL 9000</a> with a human personality that the crew calls "Hal". Hal says he is "foolproof and incapable of error". Hal raises concerns about the nature of the mission to Bowman, but their conversation is interrupted when Hal reports the imminent failure of an antenna control device. The astronauts retrieve it in an <a href="/wiki/Extravehicular_activity" title="Extravehicular activity">extravehicular activity</a> (EVA) pod but find nothing wrong. Hal suggests reinstalling the device and letting it fail so the problem can be found. Mission Control advises the astronauts that results from their twin HAL 9000 indicate that Hal is in error about the device's imminent failure. Hal says the discrepancy must be due to human error. Concerned about Hal's behavior, Bowman and Poole enter an EVA pod to talk without Hal overhearing, and agree to disconnect Hal if he is proven wrong. Hal secretly follows their conversation by <a href="/wiki/Lip_reading" title="Lip reading">lip reading</a>. While Poole is on a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Extra-vehicular_activity" title="Extra-vehicular activity">space walk</a> outside his EVA pod attempting to replace the unit, Hal takes control of the pod, severs his oxygen hose and sets him adrift. Bowman takes another pod to rescue Poole.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Hal turns off the life support functions of the crewmen in suspended animation. When Bowman returns to the ship with Poole's body, Hal refuses to let him in, stating that the astronauts' plan to deactivate him jeopardizes the mission. Bowman opens the ship's emergency airlock manually, enters the ship, and proceeds to Hal's processor core. Hal tries to reassure Bowman, then pleads with him to stop, and finally expresses fear. As Bowman gradually deactivates the circuits controlling Hal's higher intellectual functions, Hal regresses to his earliest programmed memory, the song "<a href="/wiki/Daisy_Bell" title="Daisy Bell">Daisy Bell</a>", which he sings for Bowman. When Bowman disconnects Hal, a prerecorded video message from Floyd plays, revealing that the mission's true objective is to investigate a radio signal, sent from a lunar artifact (the monolith) to Jupiter. Only Hal and the hibernating crew had been told this.
</p><p>At Jupiter, Bowman leaves <i>Discovery One</i> in an EVA pod to investigate another monolith orbiting the planet. The pod is pulled into a vortex of colored light, the Star Gate, and Bowman races across vast distances of space, viewing bizarre cosmological phenomena and strange landscapes of unusual colors.
</p><p>Bowman finds himself in a bedroom appointed in the <a href="/wiki/Baroque" title="Baroque">baroque</a> style. He sees, and then becomes, older versions of himself, first standing in the bedroom, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire and eating dinner, and finally as an old man lying in the bed. A monolith appears at the foot of the bed, and as Bowman reaches for it, he is transformed into a <a href="/wiki/Fetus" title="Fetus">fetus</a> enclosed in a transparent orb of light, the Star Child. The new being floats in space beside the Earth, gazing at it.
</p><p>Set in and around <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> just prior to and following <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, the story opens with <i><a href="/wiki/Ziegfeld_Follies" title="Ziegfeld Follies">Ziegfeld Follies</a></i> star <a href="/wiki/Fanny_Brice" title="Fanny Brice">Fanny Brice</a> awaiting the return of husband Nicky Arnstein from prison, and then moves into an extended <a href="/wiki/Flashback_(narrative)" title="Flashback (narrative)">flashback</a> focusing on their meeting and marriage.
</p><p>Fanny is first seen as a stage-struck teenager who gets her first job in <a href="/wiki/Vaudeville" title="Vaudeville">vaudeville</a> and meets the suave Arnstein following her debut performance. They continue to meet occasionally over the years, becoming more romantically involved as Fanny's career flourishes and she becomes a star. Arnstein eventually seduces Fanny, who decides to abandon the <i>Follies</i> to be with him.
</p><p>After winning a fortune playing poker while traveling aboard the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/RMS_Berengaria" title="RMS Berengaria">RMS <i>Berengaria</i></a>, Nicky agrees to marry Fanny. They move into an expensive house and have a daughter, and Fanny eventually returns to Ziegfeld and the <i>Follies</i>. Meanwhile, Nicky's various business ventures fail, forcing them to move into an apartment. Refusing financial support from his wife, he becomes involved in a bonds scam and is imprisoned for <a href="/wiki/Embezzlement" title="Embezzlement">embezzlement</a> for eighteen months.
</p><p>Following Nicky's release from prison, he and Fanny agree to separate.
</p><p>In late 1890s <a href="/wiki/Wyoming" title="Wyoming">Wyoming</a>, <a href="/wiki/Butch_Cassidy" title="Butch Cassidy">Butch Cassidy</a> is the affable, clever, talkative leader of the outlaw <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hole_in_the_Wall_Gang" title="Hole in the Wall Gang">Hole in the Wall Gang</a>. His closest companion is the laconic <a href="/wiki/Sharpshooter" title="Sharpshooter">dead-shot</a> "<a href="/wiki/Sundance_Kid" title="Sundance Kid">Sundance Kid</a>". The two return to their hideout at <a href="/wiki/Hole-in-the-Wall" title="Hole-in-the-Wall">Hole-in-the-Wall</a> (Wyoming) to discover that the rest of the gang, irked at Butch's long absences, have selected <a href="/wiki/Harvey_Logan" title="Harvey Logan">Harvey Logan</a> as their new leader.
</p><p>Harvey challenges Butch to a <a href="/wiki/Knife_fight" title="Knife fight">knife fight</a> over the gang's leadership. Butch defeats him using trickery, but embraces Harvey's idea to rob the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Union_Pacific" title="Union Pacific">Union Pacific</a> <i>Overland Flyer</i> train on both its eastward and westward runs, agreeing that the second robbery would be unexpected and likely reap even more money than the first.
</p><p>The first robbery goes well. To celebrate, Butch and Sundance visit a favorite <a href="/wiki/Brothel" title="Brothel">brothel</a> in a nearby town and watch, amused, as the town sheriff unsuccessfully attempts to organize a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Posse_comitatus_(common_law)" title="Posse comitatus (common law)">posse</a> to track down the gang. They then visit Sundance's lover, schoolteacher <a href="/wiki/Etta_Place" title="Etta Place">Etta Place</a>.
</p><p>On the second train robbery, Butch uses too much <a href="/wiki/Dynamite" title="Dynamite">dynamite</a> to blow open the <a href="/wiki/Safe" title="Safe">safe</a>, blowing up the baggage car. As the gang scrambles to gather up the money, a second train arrives carrying a six-man team of lawmen pursuing Butch and Sundance, who unsuccessfully try to hide out in the brothel and to seek <a href="/wiki/Amnesty" title="Amnesty">amnesty</a> from the friendly Sheriff Bledsoe by enlisting in the army.
</p><p>As the posse remains in pursuit, despite all attempts to elude them, Butch and Sundance determine that the group includes renowned Indian <a href="/wiki/Tracking_(hunting)" title="Tracking (hunting)">tracker</a> "Lord Baltimore" and relentless lawman <a href="/wiki/Joe_Lefors" title="Joe Lefors">Joe Lefors</a>, recognizable by his white <a href="/wiki/Boater" title="Boater">skimmer</a>. Butch and Sundance finally elude their pursuers by jumping from a cliff into a river far below. They learn from Etta that the posse has been paid by Union Pacific head <a href="/wiki/E._H._Harriman" title="E. H. Harriman">E. H. Harriman</a> to remain on their trail until Butch and Sundance are both killed.
</p><p>Butch convinces Sundance and Etta that the three should escape to <a href="/wiki/Bolivia" title="Bolivia">Bolivia</a>, which Butch envisions as a robber's paradise. On their arrival there, Sundance is dismayed by the living conditions and regards the country with contempt, but Butch remains optimistic. They discover that they know too little <a href="/wiki/Spanish_language" title="Spanish language">Spanish</a> to pull off a bank robbery, so Etta attempts to teach them the language. With her as an accomplice, they become successful bank robbers known as <i>Los Bandidos Yanquis</i>. However, their confidence drops when they see a man wearing a white hat (the signature of determined lawman Lefors) and fear that Harriman's posse is still after them.
</p><p>Butch suggests "going straight", and he and Sundance land their first honest job as <a href="/wiki/Payroll" title="Payroll">payroll</a> guards for a mining company. However, they are ambushed by local bandits on their first run and their boss, Percy Garris, is killed. Butch and Sundance ambush and kill the bandits, the first time Butch has ever shot someone. Etta recommends farming or ranching as other lines of work, but they conclude the straight life isn't for them. Sensing they will be killed if they return to robbery, Etta decides to go back to the United States.
</p><p>Butch and Sundance steal a payroll and the mules carrying it, and arrive in a small town. A boy recognizes the mules' <a href="/wiki/Livestock_branding" title="Livestock branding">brand</a> and alerts the local police, leading to a gunfight with the outlaws. They take cover in a building but are both seriously wounded, after Butch makes a futile attempt to run to the mules in order to bring more ammunition, while Sundance provides cover fire. As dozens of Bolivian soldiers surround the area, Butch suggests the duo's next destination should be Australia. They charge out of the building guns blazing, directly into a firing squad as the image freezes to the sound of dozens of muskets firing repeatedly.
</p><p>Oliver Barrett IV, the heir of an American upper-class <a href="/wiki/East_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="East Coast of the United States">East Coast</a> family, is attending <a href="/wiki/Harvard_College" title="Harvard College">Harvard College</a> where he plays <a href="/wiki/Ice_hockey" title="Ice hockey">ice hockey</a>. He meets Jennifer "Jenny" Cavilleri, a quick-witted, working-class <a href="/wiki/Radcliffe_College" title="Radcliffe College">Radcliffe College</a> student of classical music; they quickly fall in love despite their differences.  
</p><p>When Jenny reveals her plans to study in Paris, Oliver is upset that he does not figure in those plans. He proposes, she accepts, and they travel to the Barrett mansion so that she can meet Oliver's parents, who are judgmental and unimpressed with her. Later Oliver's father tells him that he will cut him off financially if he marries Jenny. After graduation Oliver and Jenny marry nonetheless.
</p><p>Without his father's financial support, the couple struggle to pay Oliver's way through <a href="/wiki/Harvard_Law_School" title="Harvard Law School">Harvard Law School</a>; Jenny works as a teacher. Oliver graduates third in his class and takes a position at a respectable New York City <a href="/wiki/Law_firm" title="Law firm">law firm</a>. They are ready to start a family, but fail to conceive. After many tests Oliver is told that Jenny is terminally ill.
</p><p>Oliver attempts to live a "normal life" without telling Jenny of her condition, but she finds out after confronting her doctor. Oliver buys tickets to Paris, but she declines to go, wanting only to spend time with him. To pay for Jenny's cancer therapy, Oliver seeks money from his estranged father, who asks him if he has "gotten a girl in trouble."  Oliver simply says yes, and his father writes a cheque.
</p><p>From her hospital bed, Jenny makes funeral arrangements with her father, then asks for Oliver. She tells him to not blame himself, insisting that he never held her back from music and it was worth it for the love they shared. Jenny's last wish is made when she asks him to embrace her tightly before she dies. As grief-stricken Oliver leaves the hospital, he sees his father outside, having rushed to New York City from Massachusetts as soon as he heard the news about Jenny and wanting to offer his help. Oliver tells him, "Jenny's dead," and his father says "I'm sorry," to which Oliver responds, "Love– <a href="/wiki/Love_means_never_having_to_say_you%27re_sorry" title="Love means never having to say you're sorry">Love means never having to say you're sorry</a>."

</p><p><a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> is paralyzed by a snowstorm affecting <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lincoln_International_Airport" title="Lincoln International Airport">Lincoln International Airport</a>. A Trans Global Airlines (TGA) <a href="/wiki/Boeing_707" title="Boeing 707">Boeing 707</a> flight crew misjudge their turn from Runway 29 onto the taxiway, becoming stuck in the snow and closing that runway. Airport manager Mel Bakersfeld (Burt Lancaster) is forced to work overtime, causing tension with his wife, Cindy. A divorce seems imminent as he nurtures a closer relationship with a co-worker, TGA customer relations agent Tanya Livingston (Jean Seberg).
</p><p>Vernon Demerest (Dean Martin) is a TGA <a href="/wiki/Pilot_licensing_and_certification#Airline_Transport_Pilot" title="Pilot licensing and certification">captain</a> scheduled to be the checkride captain for the airline to evaluate Captain Anson Harris during its Flight 2 to <a href="/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a>. TGA's flagship international service, named <i>The Golden Argosy</i>, is being operated with a Boeing 707. Although Demerest is married to Bakersfeld's sister, Sarah, he is secretly having an affair with Gwen Meighen (Jacqueline Bisset), chief stewardess on the flight, who informs him before takeoff that she is pregnant with his child. Bakersfeld borrows <a href="/wiki/Trans_World_Airlines" title="Trans World Airlines">TWA</a> mechanic Joe Patroni (George Kennedy) to assist with moving TGA's disabled plane blocking Runway 29. Mel and Tanya also deal with Ada Quonsett (Helen Hayes), an elderly lady from <a href="/wiki/San_Diego" title="San Diego">San Diego</a> who is a habitual <a href="/wiki/Stowaway" title="Stowaway">stowaway</a> on various airlines.
</p><p>Demolition expert D.O. Guerrero (Van Heflin), down on his luck and with a history of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mental_illness" title="Mental illness">mental illness</a>, buys both a one-way TGA ticket aboard <i>The Golden Argosy</i> and a large life insurance policy with the intent of committing suicide by blowing up the plane. He plans to set off a bomb in an attaché case while over the <a href="/wiki/Atlantic_Ocean" title="Atlantic Ocean">Atlantic Ocean</a> so that his wife, Inez, will collect the insurance money of $225,000. His erratic behavior at the airport, including using his last cash to buy the insurance policy and mistaking a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Customs" title="U.S. Customs">U.S. Customs</a> officer for an airline gate agent, attracts airport officials' attention. Inez finds a Special Delivery envelope from a travel agency and, realizing D.O. might be doing something desperate, goes to the airport to try to dissuade him. She informs airport officials that he had been fired from a construction job for "misplacing" explosives and that the family's financial situation is dire.
</p><p>Ada manages to evade the TGA employee assigned the task of putting her on a flight back to <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, talks her way past the gate agent, boards Flight 2, and happens to sit next to D.O. When the <i>Golden Argosy</i> crew is made aware of D.O.'s presence and possible intentions, they turn the plane back toward Chicago without informing the passengers. Once Ada is discovered, her help is enlisted by the crew to get to D.O.'s briefcase, but the ploy fails when a would-be helpful male passenger unwittingly returns the case to D.O.
</p><p>Demerest goes back into the passenger cabin and tries to persuade D.O. not to trigger the bomb, informing him that his insurance policy will be useless. D.O. briefly considers giving Demerest the bomb, but just then another passenger exits the lavatory at the rear of the aircraft, and the same would-be helpful passenger yells out that D.O. has a bomb. D.O. runs into the lavatory, locks it, and sets off the device. D.O. dies instantly and is blown out of the aircraft through the hole in the fuselage caused by the explosion. Gwen, just outside the door, is injured in the explosion and subsequent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Explosive_decompression" title="Explosive decompression">explosive decompression</a>, but the pilots retain control of the airplane.
</p><p>With all airports east of Chicago unusable due to bad weather, they return to Lincoln for an <a href="/wiki/Emergency_landing" title="Emergency landing">emergency landing</a>. Due to the bomb damage, Demerest demands the airport's longest runway—Runway 29, which is still closed due to the stuck airliner. Eventually Bakersfield orders the plane to be pushed off the runway by snowplows, despite the costly damage they would do to it. Patroni, who is "taxi-qualified" on 707s, has been trying to move the stuck aircraft in time for Demerest's damaged aircraft to land. By exceeding the 707's engine operating parameters, Patroni frees the stuck jet without damage, allowing Runway 29 to be reopened just in time for the crippled <i>Golden Argosy</i> to land.
</p><p>In a brief <a href="/wiki/Epilogue" title="Epilogue">epilogue</a>, Ada is enjoying her reward of free first-class travel on TGA. But as she arrives at the gate, she laments that it was "much more fun the other way."
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Marseille" title="Marseille">Marseille</a>, an undercover police detective follows Alain Charnier, who runs the world's largest heroin-smuggling syndicate. The policeman is assassinated by Charnier's hitman, Pierre Nicoli. Charnier plans to smuggle $32 million of heroin into the United States by hiding it in the car of his unsuspecting friend, television personality Henri Devereaux, who is traveling to New York by ship.
</p><p>In New York City, detectives <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_%22Popeye%22_Doyle" title='Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle'>Jimmy "Popeye" Doyle</a> and Buddy "Cloudy" Russo go out for drinks at the <a href="/wiki/Copacabana_(nightclub)" title="Copacabana (nightclub)">Copacabana</a>. Popeye notices Salvatore "Sal" Boca and his young wife, Angie, entertaining mobsters involved in narcotics. They tail the couple and establish a link between the Bocas and lawyer Joel Weinstock, who is part of the narcotics underworld.
</p><p>Popeye learns from an informant that a massive shipment of heroin will arrive in the next two weeks. The detectives convince their supervisor to wiretap the Bocas' phones. Popeye and Cloudy are joined by federal agents Mulderig and Klein.
</p><p>Devereaux's vehicle arrives in New York City. Boca is impatient to make the purchase—reflecting Charnier's desire to return to France as soon as possible—while Weinstock, with more experience in smuggling, urges patience, knowing Boca's phone is tapped and that they are being investigated.
</p><p>Charnier realizes he is being observed. He "makes" Popeye and escapes on a departing subway shuttle. To avoid being tailed, he has Boca meet him in Washington D.C., where Boca asks for a delay to avoid the police. Charnier, however, wants to conclude the deal quickly. On the flight back to New York, Nicoli offers to kill Popeye, but Charnier objects, knowing that Popeye would be replaced by another policeman. Nicoli insists, however, saying they will be back in France before a replacement is assigned.
</p><p>Soon after, Nicoli attempts to shoot Popeye but misses. Popeye chases Nicoli, who boards an elevated train. Popeye commandeers a car and gives chase. Realizing he is being pursued, Nicoli works his way forward through the carriages, shoots a policeman who tries to intervene and hijacks the motorman at gunpoint, forcing him to drive straight through the next station, also shooting the train conductor. The motorman passes out and they are just about to slam into a stationary train when an emergency trackside brake engages, hurling the assassin against a glass window. Popeye arrives to see the killer descending from the platform. When the killer sees Popeye, he turns to run but is shot dead by Popeye.
</p><p>After a lengthy stakeout, Popeye impounds Devereaux's Lincoln. He and his team take it apart searching for the drugs, but come up empty-handed. Cloudy notes that the vehicle's shipping weight is 120 pounds over its listed manufacturer's weight. They remove the rocker panels and discover the heroin concealed therein. The police restore the car to its original condition and return it to Devereaux, who delivers the Lincoln to Charnier.
</p><p>Charnier drives to an old factory on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wards_Island" title="Wards Island">Wards Island</a> to meet Weinstock and deliver the drugs. After Charnier has the rocker panels removed, Weinstock's chemist tests one of the bags and confirms its quality. Charnier removes the drugs and hides the money, concealing it beneath the rocker panels of another car purchased at an auction of junk cars, which he will take back to France. Charnier and Sal drive off in the Lincoln, but hit a roadblock with a large contingent of police led by Popeye. The police chase the Lincoln back to the factory, where Boca is killed during a shootout while most of the other criminals surrender.
</p><p>Charnier escapes into the warehouse with Popeye and Cloudy in pursuit. Popeye sees a shadowy figure in the distance and opens fire a split-second after shouting a warning, killing Mulderig. Undaunted, Popeye tells Cloudy that he will get Charnier. After reloading his gun, Popeye runs into another room and a single gunshot is heard.
</p><p>Title cards note that Weinstock was indicted but his case dismissed for "lack of proper evidence"; Angie Boca received a suspended sentence for an unspecified misdemeanor; Lou Boca received a reduced sentence; Devereaux served four years in a federal penitentiary for conspiracy; and Charnier was never caught. Popeye and Cloudy were transferred out of the narcotics division and reassigned.
</p><p>The film's plot largely follows that of <a href="/wiki/Fiddler_on_the_Roof" title="Fiddler on the Roof">the musical</a> from which it is adapted.
</p><p>In 1905, Tevye, a poor Jewish <a href="/wiki/Milkman" title="Milkman">milkman</a> living in the Ukrainian village of Anatevka, a typical <a href="/wiki/Shtetl" title="Shtetl">shtetl</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Pale_of_Settlement" title="Pale of Settlement">Pale of Settlement</a> of <a href="/wiki/Russian_Empire" title="Russian Empire">Imperial Russia</a>, compares the lives of the Jews of Anatevka to a fiddler on the roof (who appears throughout the film in this metaphorical role), using tradition to "scratch out a pleasant, simple tune" without breaking their necks.
</p><p>In town, Tevye meets Perchik, a radical <a href="/wiki/Marxism" title="Marxism">Marxist</a> from <a href="/wiki/Kiev" title="Kiev">Kiev</a>, who admonishes them for talking but doing nothing about news of Jews being banished from their villages by the tsar. Tevye invites Perchik to stay with his family, offering him room and board in exchange for Perchik tutoring his daughters.
</p><p>Tevye arranges for his oldest daughter, Tzeitel, to marry Lazar Wolf, an older, and widowed, wealthy butcher. Tzeitel is in love with her childhood sweetheart, Motel Kamzoil, and begs her father not to make her marry Lazar Wolf. Although he is initially angry, Tevye realizes that Tzeitel loves Motel and yields to his daughter's demands.
</p><p>In order to convince his wife Golde that Tzeitel should not be married to Lazar Wolf, Tevye claims to have had a nightmare. He says that Golde's deceased grandmother told him Tzeitel is supposed to marry Motel, and that Lazar Wolf's late wife, Fruma-Sarah, threatened to kill Tzeitel if the two are married. Golde concludes that the dream was a message from their ancestors, and Tzeitel and Motel arrange to be married.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Tevye's second daughter, Hodel, and Perchik begin to fall in love. They argue over the story of <a href="/wiki/Leah" title="Leah">Leah</a> and the place of old religious traditions in a changing world. The two dance together, which is considered forbidden by Orthodox Jewish tradition. Perchik tells Hodel that they just changed an old tradition.
</p><p>At Tzeitel and Motel's wedding, an argument breaks out after Lazar Wolf presents the newlyweds with gifts. When Tevye tries to speak to Lazar about the Torah, Lazar refuses to listen, arguing that the wedding should have been his all along. Minutes later, another argument breaks out over whether a girl should be able to choose her own husband. Perchik addresses the crowd and says that, since they love each other, it should be left for the couple to decide. He creates further controversy by asking Hodel to dance with him.
</p><p>The crowd gradually warms to the idea and Tevye and Golde, then Motel and Tzeitel, join in dancing. The wedding proceeds with great joy. Suddenly, the military presence in the town and the constable arrive and begin a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anti-Jewish_pogroms_in_the_Russian_Empire" title="Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire">pogrom</a>, the "demonstration" which he had earlier warned Tevye was coming. The constable stops the attack on the wedding celebration after Perchik is wounded in the scuffle with the tsar's men; however, he allows the men to continue destroying property in the village. Tevye and the immediate family stand still, until Tevye angrily orders them to clean up instead of standing around. Tevye silently asks why God allowed this to happen to them.
</p><p>In its original <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Theatrical_release" title="Theatrical release">theatrical release</a>, the film was shown with an intermission and <a href="/wiki/Entr%27acte" title="Entr'acte">entr'acte music</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-afi_4-0"><a href="#cite_note-afi-4">[4]</a></sup>
</p><p>Months later, Perchik prepares to leave Anatevka for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Russian_Revolution_of_1905" title="Russian Revolution of 1905">revolution</a>. He proposes to Hodel, and she accepts. When they tell Tevye, he is furious that they have decided to marry without his permission, but he again relents because they love each other. Tevye tells Golde his reasons for consenting to their daughter's marriage, which leads them to re-evaluate their own arranged marriage. Tevye and Golde ultimately realize that, despite having been paired by a matchmaker, they do love each other.
</p><p>Weeks later, Perchik is arrested in <a href="/wiki/Kiev" title="Kiev">Kiev</a> and is <a href="/wiki/Exile" title="Exile">exiled</a> to <a href="/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a>. Hodel decides to join him there. She promises Tevye that she and Perchik will be married under a <a href="/wiki/Chuppah" title="Chuppah">canopy</a>. Meanwhile, Tzeitel and Motel become parents, and Motel finally buys the sewing machine for which he has long scrimped and saved.
</p><p>Tevye's third daughter Chava falls in love with a <a href="/wiki/Russian_Orthodox_Church" title="Russian Orthodox Church">Russian Orthodox</a> Christian named Fyedka. Tevye tells Chava to be distant friends with Fyedka, because of the difference in their religions. When Chava eventually works up the courage to ask Tevye's permission to marry Fyedka, Tevye tells her that marrying outside the family's faith is against tradition. He forbids her from having any contact with Fyedka or from even mentioning his name. The next morning, Fyedka and Chava elope and are married in a Russian Orthodox church.
</p><p>Golde learns of the marriage when she meets up with the priest. When a grief-stricken Golde tells Tevye about the marriage, he tells her that Chava is dead to the family and that they shall forget her altogether. Chava asks Tevye to accept her marriage. In a <a href="/wiki/Soliloquy" title="Soliloquy">soliloquy</a>, Tevye concludes that he cannot accept Chava <a href="/wiki/Interfaith_marriage_in_Judaism" title="Interfaith marriage in Judaism">marrying a non-Jew</a>. He accuses her of abandoning the Jewish faith and <a href="/wiki/Disownment" title="Disownment">disowns</a> her.
</p><p>One winter day, the Jews of Anatevka are notified that they have three days to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anti-Jewish_pogroms_in_the_Russian_Empire" title="Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire">leave the village or be forced out</a> by the government. Tevye, his family and friends begin packing up to leave, heading for various parts of <a href="/wiki/Europe" title="Europe">Europe</a>, Palestine, and the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a>.
</p><p>Yente, the <a href="/wiki/Shadchan" title="Shadchan">Matchmaker</a>, plans to emigrate to <a href="/wiki/Jerusalem" title="Jerusalem">Jerusalem</a>, and says goodbye to Golde with an embrace before departing. Lazar Wolf plans to emigrate to Chicago, to live with his former brother in law, whom he detests, but "a relative is a relative". Lazar and Tevye share one last embrace before departing.
</p><p>Tevye receives letters from Hodel mentioning that she is working hard while Perchik stays in the Siberian prison. It is hoped that when Perchik is released, they will join the others in the United States. Chava and her husband Fyedka come to Tevye's house and tell the family that they are leaving for <a href="/wiki/Krak%C3%B3w" title="Kraków">Kraków</a>, <a href="/wiki/Poland" title="Poland">Poland</a>, being unable to stay in a place that would force innocent people out. Tevye shows signs of forgiving Chava by murmuring under his breath "And God be with you," silently urging Tzeitel to repeat his words to Chava. Golde calls out to Chava and Fyedka, telling them where they will be living in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York</a> with a relative.

</p><p>While assassins <a href="/wiki/Mr._Wint_and_Mr._Kidd" title="Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd">Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd</a> systematically kill several diamond smugglers, <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" title="M (James Bond)">M</a> suspects that <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South African</a> diamonds are being stockpiled to depress prices by <a href="/wiki/Dumping_(pricing_policy)" title="Dumping (pricing policy)">dumping</a>, and orders Bond to uncover the smuggling ring.

The real Franks shows up on the way, but Bond intercepts and kills him, then switches IDs to make it seem like Franks is Bond.

At a funeral home, Franks' body is cremated and the diamonds are passed on to another smuggler, Shady Tree. Bond is nearly killed by Wint and Kidd when they put him into a coffin and send to a cremation oven, but Tree stops the process when he discovers that the diamonds in Franks' body were fakes planted by Bond and the CIA.
</p><p>Bond tells Leiter to ship him the real diamonds. Bond then goes to the Whyte House, a casino-hotel owned by the reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte, where Tree works as a stand-up comedian. Bond discovers there that Tree has been killed by Wint and Kidd, who did not know that the diamonds were fake.
</p><p>At the <a href="/wiki/Craps" title="Craps">craps</a> table Bond meets the opportunistic <a href="/wiki/Bond_girl" title="Bond girl">Plenty O'Toole</a>, and after gambling, brings her to his room. Gang members ambush them, throwing O'Toole out the window and into the pool. Bond spends the rest of the night with Tiffany Case, instructing her to retrieve the real diamonds at the <a href="/wiki/Circus_Circus_Las_Vegas" title="Circus Circus Las Vegas">Circus Circus</a> casino.
</p><p>Tiffany reneges on her deal to meet back with Bond and instead flees, passing off the diamonds to the next smuggler. However, seeing that O'Toole was killed after being mistaken for her, Tiffany changes her mind. She drives Bond to the airport, where the diamonds are given to Whyte's casino manager, Bert Saxby, who is followed to a remote facility. Bond enters the apparent destination of the diamonds; a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where a satellite is being built by Professor Metz, a laser refraction specialist. When Bond's cover is blown, he escapes by stealing a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Moon_buggy" title="Moon buggy">moon buggy</a> and reunites with Tiffany.
</p><p>Bond scales the walls to the Whyte House's top floor to confront Whyte. He is instead met by two identical Blofelds, who use an electronic device to sound like Whyte. Bond kills one of the Blofelds, which turns out to be a look-alike. He is then knocked out by gas, picked up by Wint and Kidd, and taken out to <a href="/wiki/Las_Vegas_Valley" title="Las Vegas Valley">Las Vegas Valley</a>, where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die.
</p><p>Bond escapes, then calls Blofeld, using a similar electronic device to pose as Saxby. He finds out Whyte's location and rescues him, Saxby being killed in the gunfight. In the meantime, Blofeld abducts Case. With the help of Whyte, Bond raids the lab and uncovers Blofeld's plot to create a <a href="/wiki/Sun_gun" title="Sun gun">laser satellite</a> using the diamonds, which by now has already been sent into orbit. With the satellite, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and the United States, then proposes an international auction for global nuclear supremacy.

Johnny Fontane, a famous singer and Vito's <a href="/wiki/Godparent" title="Godparent">godson</a>, seeks Vito's help in securing a movie role; Vito dispatches his <a href="/wiki/Consigliere" title="Consigliere">consigliere</a>, <a href="/wiki/Tom_Hagen" title="Tom Hagen">Tom Hagen</a>, to Los Angeles to persuade studio head Jack Woltz to give Johnny the part. Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized <a href="/wiki/Stud_(animal)" title="Stud (animal)">stallion</a>.
</p><p>Shortly before Christmas, drug baron Virgil "The Turk" Sollozzo, backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, <a href="/wiki/Luca_Brasi" title="Luca Brasi">Luca Brasi</a>, to spy on them. Brasi is <a href="/wiki/Garrote" title="Garrote">garroted</a> during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later Sollozzo has Vito gunned down in the street, then kidnaps Hagen. With Corleone first-born <a href="/wiki/Sonny_Corleone" title="Sonny Corleone">Sonny</a> in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca "sleeps with the fishes." Vito survives, and at the hospital Michael thwarts another attempt on his father; Michael's jaw is broken by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NYPD" title="NYPD">NYPD</a> Captain Marc McCluskey, Sollozzo's unofficial bodyguard. Sonny retaliates with a <a href="/wiki/Contract_killing" title="Contract killing">hit</a> on Bruno Tattaglia. Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey: on the deception of settling the dispute, Michael meets them in a <a href="/wiki/The_Bronx" title="The Bronx">Bronx</a> restaurant. There, retrieving a planted handgun, he kills both men.
</p><p>Despite a clampdown by the authorities, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Five_Families_(The_Godfather)" title="Five Families (The Godfather)">Five Families</a> erupt in open warfare and Vito fears for his sons' safety.

When it does, Sonny speeds to their home, but is ambushed at a highway toll booth and riddled with submachine gun fire. While in Sicily, Michael meets and marries Apollonia Vitelli, but a car bomb intended for him takes her life.
</p><p>Devastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant Don <a href="/wiki/Emilio_Barzini" title="Emilio Barzini">Emilio Barzini</a>, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s, and with his father at the end of his career and his brother too weak, Michael takes the family reins. He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Tom is not a "wartime consigliere"; Vito agrees Tom should "have no part in what will happen" in the coming battles with rival families. Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos. Michael is dismayed to see that Fredo has fallen under Greene's sway.
</p><p>In 1955, Vito suffers a fatal <a href="/wiki/Myocardial_infarction" title="Myocardial infarction">heart attack</a>. At the funeral, <a href="/wiki/Salvatore_Tessio" title="Salvatore Tessio">Tessio</a>, a Corleone <a href="/wiki/Caporegime" title="Caporegime">capo</a>, asks Michael to meet with Don Barzini, signalling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone assassins murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is executed for his treachery and Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini. A Corleone capo, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Clemenza" title="Peter Clemenza">Clemenza</a>, garrotes Carlo with a wire.

</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Georgetown_(Washington,_D.C.)" title="Georgetown (Washington, D.C.)">Georgetown</a>, actress Chris MacNeil is living on location with her 12-year-old daughter <a href="/wiki/Regan_MacNeil" title="Regan MacNeil">Regan</a>; she is starring in a film about student activism directed by her friend and associate Burke Dennings. After playing with a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ouija_board" title="Ouija board">Ouija board</a> and contacting a supposedly imaginary friend who she calls Captain Howdy, Regan begins acting strangely, including making mysterious noises, stealing, constantly using obscene language and exhibiting abnormal strength. Chris hosts a party, during which Regan comes downstairs unannounced, tells one of the guests—an astronaut—that he will die in space and then urinates on the floor. Later, Regan's bed begins to shake violently, adding further to her mother's horror. Chris consults a number of physicians, but Dr. Klein and his associates find nothing physiologically wrong with her daughter, despite Regan undergoing a battery of diagnostic tests. 
</p><p>One night when Chris is out, Burke Dennings is babysitting a heavily sedated Regan. Chris returns to hear he has died falling out the window. Although this is assumed to have been an accident given Burke's history of heavy drinking, his death is investigated by Lieutenant William Kinderman. Kinderman interviews Chris. He also consults psychiatrist Father Damien Karras, recently shaken after the death of his frail mother.
</p><p>The doctors, thinking that Regan's aberrations are mostly psychological in origin, recommend an exorcism be performed, reasoning that believing oneself to be possessed can sometimes be cured by believing that exorcism works. Chris arranges a meeting with Karras. After Regan speaks backward, in different voices, and exhibits scars in the form of the words "Help Me" on her stomach, Karras is convinced that Regan is possessed. Believing her soul is in danger, he decides to perform an exorcism. The experienced Merrin is selected for performing the actual exorcism with Karras assisting.
</p><p>Both priests witness Regan perform a series of bizarre, vulgar acts. They attempt to exorcise the demon, but the stubborn entity toys with them, especially Karras. Karras shows weakness and is dismissed by Merrin, who attempts the exorcism alone. Karras enters the room later and discovers Merrin has died of a heart attack. After failing to revive Merrin, the enraged Karras confronts the mocking, laughing spirit, and wrestles Regan's body to the ground. At Karras' invitation, it leaves Regan's body and possesses Karras. In a moment of self-sacrifice, the priest throws himself out of the window before being compelled to harm Regan. He is mortally injured. Father Dyer, an old friend of Karras, happens upon the scene and administers the last rites to his friend.
</p><p>A few days later, Regan, now back to her normal self, prepares to leave for Los Angeles with her mother. Although Regan has no apparent recollection of her possession, she is moved by the sight of Dyer's clerical collar to kiss him on the cheek. Kinderman, who narrowly misses their departure, befriends Father Dyer as he investigates Karras' death.
</p><p>The film takes place in 1936, at the height of the <a href="/wiki/Great_Depression_in_the_United_States" title="Great Depression in the United States">Great Depression</a>. Johnny Hooker, a <a href="/wiki/Confidence_trick" title="Confidence trick">grifter</a> in <a href="/wiki/Joliet,_Illinois" title="Joliet, Illinois">Joliet, Illinois</a>, cons $11,000 in cash in a <a href="/wiki/Pigeon_drop" title="Pigeon drop">pigeon drop</a> from an unsuspecting victim with the aid of his partners Luther Coleman and Joe Erie. Buoyed by the windfall, Luther announces his retirement and advises Hooker to seek out an old friend, Henry Gondorff, in <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> to teach him "the big con". Unfortunately, their victim was a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Numbers_racket" title="Numbers racket">numbers racket</a> courier for vicious crime boss Doyle Lonnegan. Corrupt Joliet police Lieutenant William Snyder confronts Hooker, revealing Lonnegan's involvement and demanding part of Hooker's cut. Having already spent his share, Hooker pays Snyder in counterfeit bills. Lonnegan's men murder both the courier and Luther, and Hooker flees for his life to Chicago.
</p><p>Hooker finds Henry Gondorff, a once-great con-man now hiding from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/FBI" title="FBI">FBI</a>, and asks for his help in taking on the dangerous Lonnegan. Gondorff is initially reluctant, but he relents and recruits a core team of experienced con men to dupe Lonnegan. They decide to resurrect an elaborate obsolete scam known as "the wire", using a larger crew of con artists to create a phony <a href="/wiki/Off-track_betting" title="Off-track betting">off-track betting</a> parlor. Aboard the opulent <i><a href="/wiki/20th_Century_Limited" title="20th Century Limited">20th Century Limited</a></i>, Gondorff, posing as boorish Chicago bookie Shaw, buys into Lonnegan's private, high-stakes <a href="/wiki/Poker" title="Poker">poker</a> game. Shaw infuriates Lonnegan with his obnoxious behavior, then outcheats him to win $15,000. Hooker, posing as Shaw's disgruntled employee, Kelly, is sent to collect the winnings and instead convinces Lonnegan that he wants to take over Shaw's operation. Kelly reveals that he has a partner named Les Harmon (actually con man Kid Twist) in the Chicago <a href="/wiki/Western_Union" title="Western Union">Western Union</a> office, who will allow them to win bets on horse races by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Past-posting" title="Past-posting">past-posting</a>.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Snyder has tracked Hooker to Chicago, but his pursuit is thwarted when he is summoned by undercover FBI agents led by Agent Polk, who orders him to assist in their plan to arrest Gondorff using Hooker. At the same time, Lonnegan has grown frustrated with the inability of his men to find and kill Hooker for the Joliet con. Unaware that Kelly is Hooker, he demands that Salino, his best assassin, be given the job. A mysterious figure with black leather gloves is then seen following and observing Hooker.
</p><p>Kelly's connection appears effective, as Harmon provides Lonnegan with the winner of one horse race and the <a href="/wiki/Trifecta" title="Trifecta">trifecta</a> of another. Lonnegan agrees to finance a $500,000 bet at Shaw's parlor to break Shaw and gain revenge. Shortly thereafter, Snyder captures Hooker and brings him before FBI Agent Polk. Polk forces Hooker to betray Gondorff by threatening to incarcerate Luther Coleman's widow.
</p><p>The night before the sting, Hooker sleeps with Loretta, a waitress from a local restaurant. As Hooker leaves the building the next morning, he sees Loretta walking toward him. The black-gloved man appears behind Hooker and shoots her dead – she was Lonnegan's hired killer, Loretta Salino, and the gunman was hired by Gondorff to protect Hooker.
</p><p>Armed with Harmon's tip to "place it on Lucky Dan", Lonnegan makes the $500,000 bet at Shaw's parlor on Lucky Dan to win. As the race begins, Harmon arrives and expresses shock at Lonnegan's bet, explaining that when he said "place it" he meant, literally, that Lucky Dan would "place" (i.e., <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Across_the_board" title="Across the board">finish <i>second</i></a>). In a panic, Lonnegan rushes the teller window and demands his money back. A moment later Polk, Lt. Snyder, and a half dozen FBI agents storm the parlor. Polk confronts Gondorff, then tells Hooker he is free to go. Gondorff, reacting to the betrayal, shoots Hooker in the back. Polk then shoots Gondorff and orders Snyder to get the ostensibly-respectable Lonnegan away from the crime scene. With Lonnegan and Snyder safely away, Hooker and Gondorff rise amid cheers and laughter. Agent Polk is actually Hickey, a con man, running a con atop Gondorff's con to divert Snyder and provide a solid "blow off". As the con men strip the room of its contents, Hooker refuses his share of the money, saying "I'd only blow it", and walks away with Gondorff.
</p><p>Architect Doug Roberts returns to <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> for the dedication of the Glass Tower, which he designed for contractor James Duncan. The Tower, 1,688 feet tall and 138 stories, is the world's tallest building. During pre-dedication testing, an electrical short starts an undetected fire on the 81st floor. Roberts suspects that Roger Simmons, the electrical subcontractor and Duncan's son-in-law, cut corners. Roberts confronts Simmons, who feigns innocence.
</p><p>During the dedication ceremony, chief of Public Relations Dan Bigelow turns on all the tower's lights, but Roberts orders them shut off to reduce the load on the electrical system. Smoke is seen on the 81st floor, and the <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Fire_Department" title="San Francisco Fire Department">San Francisco Fire Department</a> (SFFD) is summoned. Roberts and engineer Will Giddings go to the 81st floor, where Giddings is fatally burned pushing a guard away from the fire. Roberts reports the fire to Duncan, who is courting Senator Gary Parker for an <a href="/wiki/Urban_renewal" title="Urban renewal">urban renewal</a> contract and refuses to order an evacuation.
</p><p>SFFD Chief Michael O'Halloran arrives and forces Duncan to evacuate the guests from the Promenade Room on the 135th floor. Simmons admits to Duncan that he cut corners, doing so to bring the project back under budget, and suggests other subcontractors did likewise. Lisolette Mueller, a guest being wooed by <a href="/wiki/Confidence_trick" title="Confidence trick">con man</a> Harlee Claiborne, rushes to the 87th floor to check on a deaf mother. Security Chief Jernigan rescues the mother, but fire forces her children – along with Roberts and Lisolette – up to the Promenade Room. Bigelow and his mistress Lorrie are killed when fire traps them in the Duncan Enterprises offices on the 65th floor.
</p><p>Fire overtakes the express elevators, killing a group whose elevator stops on the engulfed 81st floor. Though the scenic elevator is still working, the stairways from the Promenade Room are blocked – one by fire, the other by mishandled cement. Just as the firemen begin to bring the fire under control, the electrical system fails, deactivating the passenger elevators; O’Hallorhan must <a href="/wiki/Abseiling" title="Abseiling">rappel</a> down the elevator shaft to safety.
</p><p>An attempt at a helicopter rescue fails when panicky party-goers rush the helipad, causing the helicopter to veer off, crash, and set the roof ablaze. Naval rescue teams attach a <a href="/wiki/Breeches_buoy" title="Breeches buoy">breeches buoy</a> to an adjacent skyscraper and rescue a number of guests, including Patty Simmons, Duncan's daughter. Roberts rigs a <a href="/wiki/Check_valve" title="Check valve">gravity brake</a> on the scenic elevator, allowing one trip down for twelve people, including Lisolette and the children. An explosion near the 110th floor throws Lisolette from the elevator and leaves the elevator hanging by a single cable, but O’Hallorhan rescues the elevator with a Navy helicopter.
</p><p>As fire reaches the Promenade Room, a group of men led by Simmons attempts to commandeer the breeches buoy, which is subsequently destroyed in an explosion, killing Simmons, Senator Parker, and several other men. In a last-ditch strategy, O'Halloran and Roberts blow up water tanks atop the Tower with <a href="/wiki/Plastic_explosive" title="Plastic explosive">plastic explosives</a>. Most of the party-goers survive as water rushes through the ruined building, extinguishing the flames.
</p><p>Jernigan gives Claiborne, who is heartbroken at Lisolette's death, her cat. Duncan, consoling his grieving daughter, promises that such a tragic debacle will never happen again. Roberts accepts O’Hallorhan’s offer of guidance on how to build a fire-safe skyscraper. O’Hallorhan drives away, exhausted.
</p><p>On the <a href="/wiki/American_frontier" title="American frontier">American frontier</a> of 1874, a new railroad will soon be rerouted through Rock Ridge, in order to avoid running through <a href="/wiki/Quicksand" title="Quicksand">quicksand</a>. Realizing this will make Rock Ridge worth millions, the conniving attorney general <a href="/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr" title="Hedy Lamarr">Hedley Lamarr</a> wants to force Rock Ridge's residents to abandon their town, and sends a gang of thugs, led by his flunky Taggart, to shoot the sheriff and trash the town. The townspeople demand that Governor <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Le_Petomane" title="Le Petomane">William J. Le Petomane</a> appoint a new sheriff to protect them. Lamarr persuades the dim-witted Le Petomane to appoint Bart, a black railroad worker, who was about to be executed for assaulting Taggart earlier. A black sheriff, he reasons, will offend the townspeople, create chaos, and leave the town at his mercy.
</p><p>After an initial hostile reception (where Sheriff Bart has to take himself hostage to escape), he relies on his quick wits and the assistance of Jim, an alcoholic gunslinger known as the "Waco Kid", to overcome the townspeople's hostility. He subdues Mongo, an immensely strong, dim-witted, but philosophical henchman sent to kill him, then he beats German seductress-for-hire Lili von Shtüpp at her own game, with Lili falling in love with him. Upon Mongo's release, he vaguely informs Bart of Lamarr's connection to the railroad, so Bart and Jim visit the railroad work site and discover from Charlie, Bart's best friend, that the railway is planned to go through Rock Ridge. Just as Taggart and his men arrive to kill Bart, Jim outshoots the thugs, forcing Taggart to retreat to Lamarr. Lamarr, furious that his schemes have backfired, hatches a larger plan involving a recruited army of thugs, including common criminals, <a href="/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan" title="Ku Klux Klan">Ku Klux Klansmen</a>, Nazis, and <a href="/wiki/Methodism" title="Methodism">Methodists</a>.
</p><p>Three miles east of Rock Ridge, Bart introduces the white townspeople to the black, Chinese, and Irish railroad workers, who have agreed to help in exchange for acceptance by the community, and explains his plan to defeat Lamarr's army. They labor all night to build a perfect replica of their town, as a diversion; with no people in it, though, Bart realizes it will not fool the villains. While the townspeople construct replicas of themselves, Bart, Jim, and Mongo buy time by constructing the "<a href="/wiki/New_York_State_Thruway" title="New York State Thruway">Gov. William J. Le Petomane Thruway</a>", forcing the raiding party to turn back for "a shitload of dimes" to pay the toll. Once through the tollbooth, the raiders attack the fake town populated with dummies, which are booby-trapped with dynamite bombs. After Jim detonates the bombs with his sharpshooting, launching bad guys and horses skyward, the Rock Ridgers storm the villains.
</p><p>The resulting brawl between townsfolk, railroad workers, and Lamarr's thugs breaks the <a href="/wiki/Fourth_wall" title="Fourth wall">fourth wall</a>, spilling onto a neighboring set, where director Buddy Bizarre is directing a <a href="/wiki/Busby_Berkeley" title="Busby Berkeley">Busby Berkeley</a>-style top-hat-and-tails musical number; then into the studio commissary for a food fight; and then out of the <a href="/wiki/Warner_Bros._Studios,_Burbank" title="Warner Bros. Studios, Burbank">Warner Bros. film lot</a> into the streets of Burbank. Lamarr, realizing he has been beaten, hails a taxi and orders the driver to "drive me off this picture". He ducks into <a href="/wiki/Grauman%27s_Chinese_Theatre" title="Grauman's Chinese Theatre">Grauman's Chinese Theatre</a>, which is playing the premiere of <i>Blazing Saddles</i>. As he settles into his seat, he sees Bart arriving on horseback outside the theatre. Bart blocks Lamarr's escape, and then shoots him in the groin. Bart and Jim then go into Grauman's to watch the end of the film, in which Bart announces to the townspeople that he is moving on. Riding out of town, he finds Jim, and invites him along to "nowhere special". They ride off into the sunset on horseback, but stop at a chauffeured <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Stretch_limousine" title="Stretch limousine">stretch limousine</a> and continue outward in the vehicle.
</p><p>During a beach party at dusk on Amity Island, <a href="/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a>, a young woman, Chrissie Watkins, goes <a href="/wiki/Nude_swimming" title="Nude swimming">skinny dipping</a> in the ocean. While <a href="/wiki/Treading_water" title="Treading water">treading water</a>, she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner's ruling that the death was due to a <a href="/wiki/Shark_attack" title="Shark attack">shark attack</a> leads police chief Martin Brody to close the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly thereafter. A bounty is placed on the shark, prompting an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, and confirms her death was caused by a shark—an unusually large one.
</p><p>When local fishermen catch a <a href="/wiki/Tiger_shark" title="Tiger shark">tiger shark</a>, the mayor proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes that it is the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable <a href="/wiki/Great_white_shark" title="Great white shark">great white shark</a>'s tooth embedded in the submerged hull. He drops it in fright after encountering a partial corpse. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's statements that a huge great white shark is responsible for the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank in which the presence of a shark is simulated, the real shark enters a nearby <a href="/wiki/Estuary" title="Estuary">estuary</a>, killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces Vaughn to hire Quint.
</p><p>Quint, Brody, and Hooper set out on Quint's boat, the <i>Orca</i>, to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a <a href="/wiki/Chumming" title="Chumming">chum</a> line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating its length at 25 feet (7.6 m) and weight at 3 tonnes (3.0 long tons; 3.3 short tons), harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.
</p><p>At nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars and Quint reveals that he survived the <a href="/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)" title="USS Indianapolis (CA-35)">USS <i>Indianapolis</i></a>. The shark returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull, and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he intentionally pushes the damaged engine past the safety limits and the overtaxed engine fails.
</p><p>With the <i>Orca</i> slowly sinking, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on <a href="/wiki/Scuba_set" title="Scuba set">scuba gear</a> and enters the water in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shark-proof_cage" title="Shark-proof cage">shark-proof cage</a>, intending to lethally inject the shark with <a href="/wiki/Strychnine" title="Strychnine">strychnine</a>, using a hypodermic spear. The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly and devours Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody jams a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion obliterates the shark. Hooper surfaces, and he and Brody paddle back to Amity Island clinging to the remaining barrels.
</p><p>In late 1975, the <a href="/wiki/Heavyweight" title="Heavyweight">heavyweight</a> <a href="/wiki/Boxing" title="Boxing">boxing</a> world champion, Apollo Creed, announces plans to hold a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Title_bout" title="Title bout">title bout</a> in <a href="/wiki/Philadelphia" title="Philadelphia">Philadelphia</a> during the upcoming <a href="/wiki/United_States_Bicentennial" title="United States Bicentennial">United States Bicentennial</a>. However, he is informed five weeks from the fight date that his scheduled opponent is unable to compete due to an injured hand. With all other potential replacements booked up or otherwise unavailable, Creed decides to spice things up by giving a local contender a chance to challenge him. He settles in on <a href="/wiki/Rocky_Balboa" title="Rocky Balboa">Rocky Balboa</a>, an aspiring <a href="/wiki/Southpaw_stance" title="Southpaw stance">southpaw</a> boxer from an Italian neighborhood of Philadelphia, known by the nickname "The Italian Stallion".
</p><p>Rocky meets with <a href="/wiki/Promoter_(entertainment)" title="Promoter (entertainment)">promoter</a> Miles Jergens, unexpectedly presuming Creed is seeking local sparring partners. Reluctant at first, Rocky eventually agrees to the fight which will pay him $150,000. After several weeks of training, using whatever he can find, including meat carcasses as <a href="/wiki/Punching_bag" title="Punching bag">punching bags</a>, Rocky accepts an offer of assistance from gym proprietor Mickey "Mighty Mick" Goldmill, a respected trainer and former <a href="/wiki/Bantamweight" title="Bantamweight">bantamweight</a> fighter from the 1920s, who always criticized Rocky for wasting his potential.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Rocky meets Adrian Pennino, who is working part-time at the J&amp;M Tropical Fish <a href="/wiki/Pet_store" title="Pet store">pet store</a>. He begins to build a romantic relationship with Adrian, culminating in a kiss. Adrian's brother, Paulie, becomes jealous of Rocky's success, but Rocky calms him by agreeing to advertise his <a href="/wiki/Meat_packing_industry" title="Meat packing industry">meatpacking business</a> before the upcoming fight. The night before the fight, Rocky begins to lose confidence after touring the arena. He confesses to Adrian that he does not expect to win, but wants to <a href="/wiki/The_distance_(boxing)" title="The distance (boxing)">go the distance</a> against Creed, which no other fighter has done, and prove himself to everyone.
</p><p>On <a href="/wiki/New_Year%27s_Day" title="New Year's Day">New Year's Day</a>, the fight is held, with Creed making a dramatic entrance dressed as <a href="/wiki/George_Washington" title="George Washington">George Washington</a> and then <a href="/wiki/Uncle_Sam" title="Uncle Sam">Uncle Sam</a>. Taking advantage of his overconfidence, Rocky knocks him down in the first round—the first time that Creed has ever been knocked down. Humiliated, Creed takes Rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight, though his ego never fully fades. The fight goes on for the full fifteen rounds, with both combatants sustaining various injuries, Rocky with a detached retina in his right eye and hits to the head, and Apollo with internal bleeding and a broken rib. As the fight progresses, Creed's superior skill is countered by Rocky's apparently unlimited ability to absorb punches, and his dogged refusal to go down. As the final round bell sounds, with both fighters locked in each other's arms, they promise to each other that there will be no rematch.
</p><p>After the fight, the sportscasters and the audience go wild. Jergens announces over the loudspeaker that the fight was "the greatest exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the ring", and Rocky calls out repeatedly for Adrian, who runs down and comes into the ring as Paulie distracts arena security. As Jergens declares Creed the winner by virtue of a split decision (8:7, 7:8, 9:6), Adrian and Rocky embrace and profess their love to each other, not caring about the result of the fight.

</p><p>In the summer of 1958, <a href="/wiki/Greaser_(subculture)" title="Greaser (subculture)">greaser</a> Danny Zuko and sweet Australian girl Sandy Olsson meet at the beach and fall in love. When the summer comes to an end, Sandy, whose family is returning to Australia, worries that they might never meet again, but Danny tells her that their love is "only the beginning." At the beginning of the new school year at Rydell High School ("Grease"), Danny reunites with his fellow gang members, the T-Birds, of whom his best friend Kenickie, along with Doody, Sonny, and Putzie are members. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Danny, Sandy arrives at school, with her family's plans having changed, with her new friend Frenchy, a member of the Pink Ladies. Other Pink Ladies Rizzo, Marty, and Jan also arrive, excited to be seniors, as does Patty Simcox, a high-achieving cheerleader.
</p><p>At lunch, Frenchy introduces Sandy to the other Pink Ladies while Danny and the T-Birds make fun of practicing football players, including the handsome Tom Chisum. Each group asks Danny and Sandy, respectively, about their summers and they each independently describe their romance without using the other's name, with Sandy's description far more innocent than Danny's ("Summer Nights"). Headed back to class, Sandy reveals that it was Danny Zuko she met, and Rizzo teases that perhaps she'll meet him again.
</p><p>At a pep rally before a <a href="/wiki/American_football" title="American football">football</a> game, Sandy and Patty perform as cheerleaders; there, Sandy and Tom flirt.  Kenickie arrives with a used car he plans on rebuilding so he can race it at Thunder Road, a popular <a href="/wiki/Street_racing" title="Street racing">street race</a> spot; as he says this, Leo Balmudo, a rival greaser from the Scorpions, drives by in a menacing manner. Rizzo puts Sandy and Danny together, surprising both of them.  At first, they both are thrilled to see each other, but Danny almost instantly after acts boyish, obnoxious and indifferent to her in front of his friends to seem impressive, upsetting Sandy. Frenchy invites Sandy to a sleepover with the Pink Ladies to cheer her up.
</p><p>Rizzo and the other girls pressure Sandy into smoking a cigarette and having a drink of wine at the sleepover. Frenchy reveals that she plans to drop out of Rydell to go to beauty school and in an effort to prove herself, tries to pierce Sandy's ear, making Sandy sick. Rizzo makes fun of her innocent nature ("Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee") and leaves when the T-Birds arrive in Kenickie's car. Rizzo tries to make Danny jealous by flirting with Kenickie, but Danny is unmoved and leaves.  Kenickie leaves with Rizzo, stranding Putzie, Sonny, and Doody. Sandy laments over her feelings towards Danny, despite his earlier behavior ("Hopelessly Devoted to You").
</p><p>Kenickie and Rizzo, while in the midst of sex, are interrupted when Leo, along with his girlfriend Cha-Cha, deliberately crashes his own street racer into Kenickie's and insults Rizzo. At the same time, Kenickie's condom breaks.
</p><p>The next day, the T-Birds look over Kenickie's car, and although they are initially skeptical of its potential, Danny and Kenickie explain the modifications they could add to make it a hot-rodding sex machine ("Greased Lightnin'"). At the popular hangout The Frosty Palace, Danny, after brushing off an attempt by Patty to flirt with him, apologizes to Sandy for his behavior at the pep rally, but she rejects him having started dating Tom instead. Danny approaches Coach Calhoun about playing a sport.

</p><p>Danny takes Sandy to the Frosty Palace for a date; they are soon joined by the rest of the greasers, and Danny and Sandy quickly leave in discomfort. Putzie and Jan, in an awkward exchange, agree to pair off for the dance; Kenickie and Rizzo get into an argument and go their separate ways, while Sonny unsuccessfully tries to court Marty. After everyone else has left, Frenchy, whose hair has turned bright pink, tells Vi, a waitress, that she has dropped out of beauty school and is visited by a <a href="/wiki/Guardian_angel" title="Guardian angel">guardian angel</a> who advises her to return to Rydell ("Beauty School Dropout").
</p><p>At the school dance, Leo and Cha-Cha show up as Rizzo's and Kenickie's respective dates. Vince Fontaine, who is hosting a live telecast of the dance, flirts with Marty. All of the students take part in a dance contest that descends into chaos ("Born to Hand Jive"). Danny and Sandy do well, but Sonny pulls Sandy off the dance floor, allowing Cha Cha to step in and win with Danny. During the last dance ("Blue Moon"), Sonny, Putzie, and Doody <a href="/wiki/Mooning" title="Mooning">moon</a> the national TV audience.
</p><p>Danny apologizes to Sandy and tries to make it up to her by taking her to a drive-in movie theater. She's unmoved by his pleas for forgiveness until he asks her to wear his ring, which she gleefully accepts. Danny then tries to make out with her, causing Sandy to angrily throw his ring at him and run off in disgust, leaving Danny distraught ("Sandy"). Meanwhile, Rizzo admits she may be pregnant to Marty and asks her to keep it a secret, but the story gets back to Kenickie, and he tells Rizzo he doesn't run away from his mistakes. Rizzo tells Kenickie the baby isn't his, which both relieves and upsets him.
</p><p>The next day, the T-Birds have finished Kenickie's car and he is eager to race it against Leo's at Thunder Road. Sandy tells Rizzo she plans to watch the race and offers to help Rizzo despite the rumors about Rizzo's character that have been spread around school. She thanks Sandy and muses to herself about how her sins are not as bad as they could be ("There Are Worse Things I Could Do").
</p><p>The T-Birds, Pink Ladies, and Scorpions gather for the race, with the winner receiving the loser's car as a prize. Just before the race begins, Kenickie hits his head, and Danny takes the wheel. Despite Leo using bladed hub caps (in a sequence paying homage to <i><a href="/wiki/Ben-Hur_(1959_film)" title="Ben-Hur (1959 film)">Ben-Hur</a></i>), Danny wins the race. Sandy watches from afar and concludes that she must change her approach to life if she wants to win over Danny, asking Frenchy for help ("Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee (Reprise)").
</p><p>The gang celebrates graduation at a school carnival where Rizzo tells Kenickie she isn't pregnant and they reunite. Danny arrives wearing a <a href="/wiki/Letterman_(sports)" title="Letterman (sports)">letterman's</a> sweater, to the other T-Birds' dismay. Sandy shocks everyone when she arrives with a new, wilder hairstyle and wearing a revealing black outfit and leather jacket. In song, Danny and Sandy reaffirm their commitment to each other ("You're the One That I Want"). As the film ends, the greasers promise to stay together after school ends ("We Go Together") and Danny and Sandy depart in a red hot rod, which takes flight as they wave goodbye to their friends.

</p><p>Bond again encounters Goodhead in Venice and observes her snooping around a door near the glass factory. Then he is chased through the canals by Drax's henchmen. He returns to the factory at night to check the door out, and discovers a secret biological laboratory, and learns that the glass vials are to hold a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nerve_gas" title="Nerve gas">nerve gas</a> deadly to humans, but harmless to animals. Chang attacks Bond, but Bond hurls him through the stained glass clockface of the Saint Mark's clocktower, killing him; during the fight, Bond finds evidence that Drax is moving his operation to Rio de Janeiro. Rejoining Goodhead, he deduces that she is a <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</a> agent spying on Drax. Bond has saved one of the vials he found earlier, as the only evidence of the now-empty laboratory; he gives it to M for analysis, who permits him to go to Rio de Janeiro under the pretence of being on leave.

Jaws captures Bond and Goodhead, to whom Drax reveals his plan to destroy human life by launching 50 globes that would dispense the nerve gas into Earth's atmosphere. Drax had transported several dozen genetically perfect young men and women of varying races to the space station in the shuttles. They would live there until Earth was safe again for human life; their descendants would be the seed for a "new master race". Bond persuades Jaws to switch his allegiance by getting Drax to admit that anyone not measuring up to his physical standards, including Dolly, would be exterminated. Jaws attacks Drax's guards, and a laser battle ensues between Drax's forces and Bond, Jaws, and the Marines.

</p><p>On New Year's Day in 1976, world heavyweight boxing champion Apollo Creed has successfully defended his title in a split decision against challenger <a href="/wiki/Rocky_Balboa" title="Rocky Balboa">Rocky Balboa</a>. He and Rocky are taken to the same hospital. Apollo challenges Rocky to a rematch, but Rocky declines and retires from <a href="/wiki/Professional_boxing" title="Professional boxing">professional boxing</a>. His girlfriend, Adrian, supports his choice, and so do his doctors, who reveal that he will require surgery for a <a href="/wiki/Retinal_detachment" title="Retinal detachment">detached retina</a>, a condition that could lead to permanent blindness. In a private moment, Rocky goes to see a recuperating Apollo, and wants a truthful response to his question of whether Apollo gave his all in the fight; Creed confirms that he did. After Rocky is released from the hospital, he enjoys the benefits of his life's changes: Rocky's new fame attracts an agent who sees Rocky as a potential endorsement and sponsorship goldmine, and his sudden wealth encourages him to propose to Adrian. She happily accepts, and they marry in a small ceremony. Soon after, Adrian reveals that she is pregnant.
</p><p>Meanwhile, fueled by hate mail, Apollo becomes obsessed with the idea that a rematch is the only way to prove that Rocky's performance was simply a fluke. Determined to rectify his boxing career's only blemish, Apollo ignores all pleas by his friends and family to forget the fight, and move on to other potential opponents, and instead demands his team do whatever necessary to goad Rocky out of retirement and have a rematch with him.
</p><p>Rocky, at first, seems unaffected by Apollo's smear campaign, but his inexperience with money causes him to run into financial problems. After several unsuccessful attempts to find employment, Rocky visits Mickey Goldmill, his trainer and manager, at his gym to talk about the possibility of returning to boxing. At first, Mickey declines, concerned about Rocky's health, but he soon accepts after Apollo publicly insults Rocky. Adrian confronts Rocky about the danger of returning to boxing and reminds him of the risk to his eyesight. Rocky argues that he knows nothing else, so this is the only way he can provide. Adrian, furious at Rocky for breaking his promise, refuses to support him.
</p><p>Rocky and Mickey begin training, but Rocky's mind is not fully set due to Adrian's disapproval. Adrian's brother, Paulie, confronts his sister about not supporting her husband, but she faints during the confrontation, and is rushed to the hospital, where she goes into labor. Despite being premature, the baby is healthy, but Adrian falls into a coma. Rocky blames himself for what happened, refusing to leave Adrian's bedside until she wakes up, and will not go to see his new baby until they can see it together. When Adrian comes out of her coma, she finds Rocky by her bedside, and the couple are shown their new baby, a boy, which they name Robert "Rocky Jr." Adrian gives her blessing to the rematch, and Rocky quickly gets into shape for the match. 
</p><p>The night of the match arrives, and Apollo makes a public goal of beating Rocky in no more than two rounds to prove the first match going the full fifteen rounds was a fluke. Rocky, fighting right-handed to protect his eye instead of his natural <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Southpaw" title="Southpaw">southpaw</a>, is knocked down twice by Creed and outclassed for much of the fight. As with their first fight, this match goes the full fifteen rounds, by which time Creed is well ahead on points and only needs to stay away from Balboa to win the fight by decision. However, Creed, not wanting the fight to end like it did the first time, ignores his trainer's pleas to stay back and attempts to beat Rocky by knockout. In the final round, Rocky switches back to his natural stance, and in dramatic fashion, unleashes a series of counter punches on Creed, turning the tide. Both men, exhausted, trade punches until they knock each other down. Apollo gets up on the ropes early while Rocky is on the canvas and has to make his way over. Rocky is able to will himself up on 9 while Apollo collapses from exhaustion, giving Rocky the win by knockout, making him the new heavyweight champion. Rocky then gives an impassioned speech to the crowd and holds the belt over his head with a message for his wife, who is watching the fight on TV: "Yo, Adrian, I did it!"

</p><p>In 1936, American archaeologist <a href="/wiki/Indiana_Jones" title="Indiana Jones">Indiana Jones</a> braves an ancient booby-trapped temple in <a href="/wiki/Peru" title="Peru">Peru</a> and retrieves a <a href="/wiki/Golden_Idol" title="Golden Idol">golden idol</a>. He is confronted by rival archaeologist <a href="/wiki/List_of_Indiana_Jones_characters#René_Belloq" title="List of Indiana Jones characters">René Belloq</a> and the indigenous <a href="/wiki/Jibito" title="Jibito">Hovito</a> people. Surrounded and outnumbered, Jones surrenders the idol to Belloq and escapes aboard a waiting <a href="/wiki/Floatplane" title="Floatplane">floatplane</a>, where he uncomfortably shares his seat with the pilot's pet snake.
</p><p>Jones returns to his teaching position at Marshall College in the fictional town of Bedford, <a href="/wiki/Connecticut" title="Connecticut">Connecticut</a>, where he is interviewed by two <a href="/wiki/Military_Intelligence_Corps_(United_States_Army)" title="Military Intelligence Corps (United States Army)">Army Intelligence</a> agents. They inform Jones that the <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazis</a> are searching for his old mentor, Abner Ravenwood, under whom Jones studied at the <a href="/wiki/University_of_Chicago" title="University of Chicago">University of Chicago</a>. The Nazis know that Ravenwood is the leading expert on the ancient city of <a href="/wiki/Tanis" title="Tanis">Tanis</a> in <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Egypt" title="Kingdom of Egypt">Egypt</a>, and that he possesses the headpiece of an <a href="/wiki/Ancient_Egypt" title="Ancient Egypt">ancient Egyptian</a> artifact known as "the Staff of <a href="/wiki/Ra" title="Ra">Ra</a>". Jones deduces that the Nazis are searching for the <a href="/wiki/Ark_of_the_Covenant" title="Ark of the Covenant">Ark of the Covenant</a> — the Nazis believe that if they acquire the Ark, their armies will become invincible. The Staff of Ra (used to project a beam of <a href="/wiki/Sunlight" title="Sunlight">sunlight</a> on a building in a diorama of the city) is the key to finding the <a href="/wiki/Well_of_Souls" title="Well of Souls">Well of Souls</a>, a secret chamber in Tanis, Egypt, in which the Ark is buried.
</p><p>The agents authorize Jones to recover the Ark to prevent the Nazis from obtaining it. He travels to <a href="/wiki/Kingdom_of_Nepal" title="Kingdom of Nepal">Nepal</a> and discovers that Ravenwood has died, and the headpiece is in the possession of Ravenwood's daughter <a href="/wiki/Marion_Ravenwood" title="Marion Ravenwood">Marion</a>. Jones visits Marion at her <a href="/wiki/Tavern" title="Tavern">tavern</a>, where she reveals her bitter feelings toward him from a previous romantic affair. She physically rebuffs his offer to buy the headpiece, and Jones leaves. Shortly after, a group of thugs arrive with their Nazi commander <a href="/wiki/List_of_Indiana_Jones_characters#Arnold_Ernst_Toht" title="List of Indiana Jones characters">Arnold Toht</a>, who had followed Jones on his flight leaving the United States. Toht threatens Marion to get the headpiece but Jones returns to the bar and fights the Nazis to save Marion. During the fight, the bar is set ablaze and the headpiece lands in the flames. Toht severely burns his hand trying to take the hot headpiece and flees the tavern screaming in agony. Jones and Marion escape with the headpiece, and Marion decides to accompany Jones in his search for the Ark so he can pay the $5,000 he has promised her.
</p><p>The pair travels to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cairo,_Egypt" title="Cairo, Egypt">Cairo, Egypt</a>, where they meet up with Jones' friend and skilled digger <a href="/wiki/Sallah" title="Sallah">Sallah</a>. Sallah informs them that Belloq and the Nazis are digging for the Well of Souls with a replica of the headpiece (created from the scar on Toht's hand). They quickly realize the Nazi headpiece is incomplete and that the Nazis are digging in the wrong place. The Nazis kidnap Marion and it appears to Jones that she is killed in an exploding truck. After a confrontation with Belloq in a local bar, Jones and Sallah infiltrate the Nazi dig site and use their staff to correctly locate the Ark. Jones discovers Marion is alive when he finds her bound and gagged in a tent. He refuses to release her out of fear of alerting the Nazis. Jones, Sallah, and a small group of diggers unearth the snake infested Well of Souls and acquire the Ark. Belloq and Nazi officer <a href="/wiki/List_of_Indiana_Jones_characters#Colonel_Dietrich" title="List of Indiana Jones characters">Colonel Dietrich</a> arrive and seize the Ark from Jones, throwing Marion into the Well of Souls with him before sealing it back up. Jones and Marion escape to a local airstrip, where Jones has a fistfight with a Nazi mechanic and destroys the <a href="/wiki/Flying_wing" title="Flying wing">flying wing</a> that was to transport the Ark to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Berlin,_Germany" title="Berlin, Germany">Berlin, Germany</a>. The panicked Nazis remove the Ark in a truck and set off for Cairo, but Jones catches them and retakes it. He makes arrangements to take the Ark to <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a> aboard <a href="/wiki/Tramp_trade" title="Tramp trade">tramp steamer</a> <i>Bantu Wind</i>.
</p><p>The next day, a Nazi <a href="/wiki/U-boat" title="U-boat">U-boat</a> appears and intercepts the ship. Belloq and Dietrich seize the Ark and Marion but cannot locate Jones, who stows away aboard the U-boat and travels with them to an island in the <a href="/wiki/Aegean_Sea" title="Aegean Sea">Aegean Sea</a>. Once there, Belloq plans to test the power of the Ark before presenting it to <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Hitler</a>. Jones reveals himself and threatens to destroy the Ark with an anti-tank rocket, but Belloq calls his bluff and Jones surrenders rather than destroy such an important historical artifact and kill Marion in the process. The Nazis take Jones and Marion to an area where the Ark will be opened and tie them to a post to observe. Belloq, dressed as an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Israelite" title="Israelite">Israelite</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/High_priest_of_Israel" title="High priest of Israel">kohen gadol</a>, performs a ceremonial opening of the Ark and finds it full of sand. Spirits emerge from the Ark, destroying the equipment the Nazis are using to film the opening, and Jones tells Marion to close her eyes and not look. Belloq and the others look on in astonishment as the ghosts are suddenly revealed to be <a href="/wiki/Destroying_angel_(Bible)" title="Destroying angel (Bible)">angels of death</a>. A vortex of flame forms above the Ark and shoots bolts of fiery energy into the gathered Nazi soldiers, killing them all.  Belloq, Toht and Dietrich all scream in terror as the Ark turns its fury on them: Dietrich's head shrivels up, Toht's face is melted off his skull and Belloq's head explodes.  Flames then engulf the remains of the doomed assembly, save for Jones and Marion, and the pillar of fire rises into the sky.  The Ark's lid is blasted high into the air before dropping back down onto the Ark and sealing it.  Jones and Marion find their ropes burned off and embrace.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a>, the Army Intelligence agents inform Jones and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Indiana_Jones_characters#Marcus_Brody" title="List of Indiana Jones characters">Marcus Brody</a> that the Ark is someplace safe and will be studied by "top men". The Ark is then shown being stored in a giant government warehouse (<a href="/wiki/Area_51" title="Area 51">Hangar 51</a>) among countless similar crates.
</p><p>A group of alien botanists secretly visit <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> under cover of night to gather plant specimens in a California forest. When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, but in their haste, one of them is left behind. In a suburban neighborhood in the <a href="/wiki/San_Fernando_Valley" title="San Fernando Valley">San Fernando Valley</a>, a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves <a href="/wiki/Reese%27s_Pieces" title="Reese's Pieces">Reese's Pieces</a> candy to lure the alien to his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its <a href="/wiki/Planetary_system" title="Planetary system">planetary system</a> and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead <a href="/wiki/Chrysanthemum" title="Chrysanthemum">chrysanthemums</a>.
</p><p>At school the next day, Elliott begins to experience a psychic connection with the alien, including exhibiting signs of intoxication (because it is at his home, drinking beer and watching <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tom_%26_Jerry" title="Tom &amp; Jerry">Tom &amp; Jerry</a></i>), and he begins freeing all the frogs in his biology class. As the alien watches <a href="/wiki/John_Wayne" title="John Wayne">John Wayne</a> kiss <a href="/wiki/Maureen_O%27Hara" title="Maureen O'Hara">Maureen O'Hara</a> in <i><a href="/wiki/The_Quiet_Man" title="The Quiet Man">The Quiet Man</a></i> on television, Elliott then kisses a girl he likes in the same manner and he is sent to the principal's office.
</p><p>The alien learns to speak English by repeating what Gertie says as she watches <i><a href="/wiki/Sesame_Street" title="Sesame Street">Sesame Street</a></i> and, at Elliott's urging, dubs itself "E.T." E.T. reads a comic strip where <a href="/wiki/Buck_Rogers" title="Buck Rogers">Buck Rogers</a>, stranded, calls for help by building a makeshift communication device and is inspired to try it himself. E.T. receives Elliott's help in building a device to "phone home" by using a <a href="/wiki/Speak_%26_Spell_(toy)" title="Speak &amp; Spell (toy)">Speak &amp; Spell</a> toy. Michael notices that E.T.'s health is declining and that Elliott is referring to himself as "we".
</p><p>On <a href="/wiki/Halloween" title="Halloween">Halloween</a>, Michael and Elliott dress E.T. as a ghost so they can sneak him out of the house. That night, Elliott and E.T. head through the forest, where they make a successful call home. The next day, Elliott wakes up in the field, only to find E.T. gone. Elliott returns home to his distressed family. Michael searches for and finds E.T. dying next to a culvert. Michael takes E.T. home to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son's illness and the dying alien, just as government agents invade the house. Scientists set up a hospital at the house, questioning Michael, Mary and Gertie while treating Elliott and E.T. Their connection disappears and E.T. then appears to die while Elliott recovers. A grief-stricken Elliott is left alone with the motionless E.T. when he notices a dead chrysanthemum, the plant E.T. had previously revived, coming back to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael's friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bicycles. Suddenly facing a police roadblock, they escape as E.T. uses <a href="/wiki/Psychokinesis" title="Psychokinesis">telekinesis</a> to lift them into the air and toward the forest, like he had done for Elliott before.
</p><p>Standing near the spaceship, E.T.'s heart glows as he prepares to return home. Mary, Gertie, and "Keys", a friendly government agent, show up. E.T. says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, as she presents him with the chrysanthemum that he had revived. Before boarding the spaceship, he embraces Elliott and tells him "I'll be right here", pointing his glowing finger to Elliott's forehead. He then picks up the chrysanthemum, boards the spaceship, and it takes off, leaving a rainbow in the sky as everyone watches it leave.

</p><p>The Rebel Alliance learns that the Empire has been constructing a new <a href="/wiki/Death_Star" title="Death Star">Death Star</a> under the supervision of the <a href="/wiki/Palpatine" title="Palpatine">Emperor</a> himself. As the station is protected by an energy shield, Han leads a strike team to destroy the shield generator on the forest moon of <a href="/wiki/Endor_(Star_Wars)" title="Endor (Star Wars)">Endor</a>; doing so would allow a squadron of starfighters to destroy the Death Star. Luke and Leia accompany the strike team to Endor in a stolen Imperial shuttle. Luke and his companions encounter a tribe of <a href="/wiki/Ewok" title="Ewok">Ewoks</a> and, after an initial conflict, gain their trust. Later, Luke tells Leia that she is his sister, Vader is their father, and that he must confront him. Surrendering to Imperial troops, Luke is brought before Vader, and he tries to convince his father to return from the dark side of the Force.
</p><p>Vader takes Luke to the Death Star to meet the Emperor, intent on turning him to the dark side. The Emperor reveals that the Death Star is operational and that the Rebel Fleet will fall into a trap. On Endor, Han's team is captured by Imperial forces, but a counterattack by the Ewoks allows the Rebels to infiltrate the shield generator. Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Lando_Calrissian" title="Lando Calrissian">Lando Calrissian</a> leads the Rebel Fleet in the <i><a href="/wiki/Millennium_Falcon" title="Millennium Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a></i>, only to find that the Death Star's shield is still active, and the Imperial fleet waiting for them. The Emperor tempts Luke to give in to his anger, and Luke engages Vader in a lightsaber duel. Vader senses that Luke has a sister, and threatens to turn her to the dark side. Enraged, Luke attacks and severs Vader's <a href="/wiki/Prosthesis" title="Prosthesis">prosthetic</a> hand. The Emperor entreats Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses, declaring himself a Jedi as his father had been. Furious, the Emperor tortures Luke with Force lightning. Unwilling to let his son die, Vader throws the Emperor down a pit, but is mortally electrocuted in the process. At his last request, Luke removes the redeemed Anakin's mask before he dies in Luke's arms.
</p><p>After the strike team destroys the shield generator, Lando leads a group of Rebel fighters into the Death Star core and destroys its main reactor. As the <i>Falcon</i> flies out of the Death Star's superstructure and Luke escapes on a shuttle with his father's body, the station explodes. On Endor, Leia reveals to Han that Luke is her brother, and they kiss. Luke cremates Anakin's body on a <a href="/wiki/Pyre" title="Pyre">pyre</a>.

</p><p>In 1935, Indiana Jones narrowly escapes the clutches of Lao Che, a crime boss in <a href="/wiki/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, <a href="/wiki/Republic_of_China_(1912%E2%80%931949)" title="Republic of China (1912–1949)">China</a>. With his 11-year-old Chinese sidekick Short Round and the nightclub singer Willie Scott in tow, Indy flees Shanghai on an airplane that, unbeknownst to them, is owned by Lao Che. While the three of them are asleep on the plane, the pilots dump the fuel and parachute out, leaving the plane to crash over the Himalayas. Indy, Shorty, and Willie discover the sabotage and narrowly manage to escape by jumping out of the plane on an inflatable raft. They ride down the mountain slopes and fall into a raging river, eventually arriving at the village of Mayapore in northern India. The impoverished villagers believe the three to have been sent by <a href="/wiki/Shiva" title="Shiva">Shiva</a> to retrieve the sacred <a href="/wiki/Lingam" title="Lingam">sivalinga</a> stone stolen from their shrine, as well as the community's missing children, from evil forces in the nearby Pankot Palace. During the journey to Pankot, Indy hypothesizes that the stone may be one of the five fabled Sankara stones that promise fortune and glory.
</p><p>The trio receive a warm welcome from the Prime Minister of Pankot Palace, Chattar Lal. The visitors are allowed to stay the night as guests, during which they attend a lavish but grotesque banquet given by the young <a href="/wiki/Maharaja" title="Maharaja">Maharaja</a>, Zalim Singh. Lal rebuffs Indy's questions about the villagers' claims and his theory that the ancient <a href="/wiki/Thuggee" title="Thuggee">Thuggee</a> cult is responsible for their troubles. Later that night, Indy is attacked by an assassin, leading Indy, Willie, and Shorty to believe that something is amiss. After Indy kills the assassin, they discover a series of tunnels hidden behind a statue in Willie's room and set out to explore them, overcoming a number of booby-traps along the way.
</p><p>The trio eventually reach an underground temple where the Thugs worship <a href="/wiki/Kali" title="Kali">Kali</a> with human sacrifice. They watch as the Thugs chain one of their victims in a cage and slowly lower him into a ceremonial lava pit, burning him alive. They discover that the Thugs, led by their high priest Mola Ram, are in possession of three of the five Sankara stones, and have enslaved the children to mine for the last two. As Indy tries to retrieve the stones, he, Willie, and Shorty are captured and separated. Indy is <a href="/wiki/Flagellation" title="Flagellation">whipped</a> and forced to drink a potion called the Blood of Kali, causing him to enter a trance-like state and mindlessly serve the Thugs. Willie is prepared for sacrifice, while Shorty is whipped and put to work in the mines alongside the children. Shorty breaks free and escapes back into the temple, where he burns Indy with a torch to bring him back to his senses. After fighting off the guards and defeating Lal, Indy stops Willie's cage and cranks it out of the pit just in time to save her from the fire, while Mola Ram escapes. Indy retrieves the Sankara stones, and the three return to the mines to free the children. As Indy fights a hulking overseer, Singh—also under Mola Ram's control—tries to cripple him with a voodoo doll. Shorty knocks the doll away and burns him to break the trance, and a restored Indy escapes and leaves the overseer to die in a rock crusher.
</p><p>The trio escape from the temple in a mine cart, pursued by Thugs, while Mola Ram orders a water cistern dumped in an attempt to flood them out. After barely escaping the deluge, they are again cornered by Mola Ram and his henchmen on a rope bridge high above a crocodile-infested river. Indy cuts the bridge in half with one man's sword, leaving everyone to hang on for their lives. As he and Mola Ram struggle over the stones, he invokes the name of <a href="/wiki/Shiva" title="Shiva">Shiva</a>, causing them to glow white-hot. Mola Ram burns his hand on the stones, causing him to lose his grip and fall to his death; Indy catches the last one safely and climbs up as a company of <a href="/wiki/British_Indian_Army" title="British Indian Army">British Indian Army</a> riflemen, summoned by Singh, arrive and open fire on the Thuggee archers trying to shoot him. Indy, Willie, and Shorty return to Mayapore with the children and give the missing stone back to the villagers.

Lorraine recalls how she met George when her father hit him with his car.
</p><p>Marty is invited by his friend, eccentric inventor <a href="/wiki/Emmett_Brown" title="Emmett Brown">Dr. Emmett Brown</a>, to meet him in a parking lot in the early hours. Doc unveils a <a href="/wiki/DeLorean_time_machine" title="DeLorean time machine">time machine built from a modified DeLorean</a> and powered by <a href="/wiki/Plutonium" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> obtained from <a href="/wiki/History_of_Libya_under_Muammar_Gaddafi" title="History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi">Libyan</a> terrorists. While showing Marty the controls, Doc sets the date to November 5, 1955: the day he conceived a time travel device. The terrorists arrive unexpectedly and shoot Doc.  Marty escapes in the DeLorean, but inadvertently activates the time machine.
</p><p>Marty finds himself in 1955 without any plutonium to return. He encounters the teenaged George, who is bullied by his classmate Biff. After Marty saves George from an oncoming car, he is knocked unconscious and awakens to find himself tended to by Lorraine, who is infatuated with him.
</p><p>Marty tracks down Doc's younger self for help. With no plutonium, Doc explains that the only power source capable of generating the necessary 1.21 gigawatts (1,620,000 hp) of electricity for the time machine is a bolt of lightning. Marty shows Doc a flyer from the future that recounts a lightning strike at the town's courthouse due the coming Saturday night. Doc instructs Marty to not leave his house or interact with anyone, as he could inadvertently <a href="/wiki/Temporal_paradox" title="Temporal paradox">alter the future</a>; because of this, Doc refuses to heed warnings from Marty about his death in 1985. When they realize that he has prevented his parents from meeting by saving George from the car, Doc warns Marty that he must find a way to introduce George to Lorraine or he will be erased from existence. Doc formulates a plan to harness the power of the lightning, while Marty sets about introducing his parents.
</p><p>After Lorraine asks Marty to the school dance, Marty concocts a plan: he will feign inappropriate advances on Lorraine, allowing George to "rescue" her. The plan goes awry when a drunken Biff attempts to force himself on Lorraine. George, enraged, knocks out Biff, and Lorraine accompanies him to the dance floor, where they kiss while Marty performs with the band.
</p><p>As the storm arrives, Marty returns to the clock tower and the lightning strikes, sending Marty back to 1985. Doc has survived the shooting, as he had listened to Marty's warnings and worn a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bullet-proof_vest" title="Bullet-proof vest">bullet-proof vest</a>. Doc takes Marty home and departs to the future. Marty awakens the next morning to find that George is a successful author, Lorraine is fit and happy, and Biff is now an obsequious <a href="/wiki/Auto_detailing" title="Auto detailing">auto valet</a>.

During an interception with two hostile <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_fictional_military_aircraft#MiG-28" title="List of fictional military aircraft">MiG-28</a> aircraft (portrayed by a <a href="/wiki/Northrop_F-5" title="Northrop F-5">Northrop F-5</a>), Maverick gets missile lock on one, while the other hostile aircraft locks onto Maverick's wingman, Cougar. While Maverick drives off the remaining MiG-28, Cougar is too shaken to land, and Maverick, defying orders, shepherds him back to the carrier. Cougar gives up his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wings_of_Gold" title="Wings of Gold">wings</a>, citing his newborn child that he has never seen. Despite his dislike for Maverick's recklessness, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Commander,_Air_Group" title="Commander, Air Group">CAG</a> "Stinger" sends him and Goose to attend Topgun,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-6"><a href="#cite_note-6">[6]</a></sup> the Naval Fighter Weapons School at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Naval_Air_Station_Miramar" title="Naval Air Station Miramar">Naval Air Station Miramar</a>.
</p><p>At a bar the day before Topgun starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman. He learns the next day that she is Charlotte "Charlie" Blackwood, an <a href="/wiki/Astrophysics" title="Astrophysics">astrophysicist</a> and civilian Topgun instructor. She becomes interested in Maverick upon learning of his inverted maneuver with the MiG-28, which disproves US intelligence on the enemy aircraft's performance.
</p><p>During Maverick's first training sortie he defeats instructor LCDR Rick "Jester" Heatherly but through reckless flying breaks two <a href="/wiki/Rules_of_engagement" title="Rules of engagement">rules of engagement</a> and is reprimanded by chief instructor CDR Mike "Viper" Metcalf. Maverick also becomes a rival to top student LT Tom "Iceman" Kazansky, who considers Maverick's flying "dangerous." Charlie also objects to Maverick's aggressive tactics but eventually admits that she admires his flying and omitted it from her reports to hide her feelings for him, and the two begin a romantic relationship.
</p><p>During a training sortie, Maverick abandons his wingman "Hollywood" to chase Viper, but is defeated when Viper maneuvers Maverick into a position from which his wingman Jester can shoot down Maverick from behind, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual prowess.
</p><p>Maverick and Iceman, now direct competitors for the Topgun Trophy, chase an <a href="/wiki/Douglas_A-4_Skyhawk" title="Douglas A-4 Skyhawk">A-4</a> in a later training engagement. Maverick pressures Iceman to break off his engagement so he can shoot it down, but Maverick's F-14 flies through the <a href="/wiki/Wake_turbulence" title="Wake turbulence">jet wash</a> of Iceman's aircraft and suffers a <a href="/wiki/Flameout" title="Flameout">flameout</a> of both engines, going into an unrecoverable <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spin_(flight)" title="Spin (flight)">flat spin</a>.

</p><p>Although the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility for Goose's death, he is overcome by guilt and his flying skill diminishes. Charlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers retiring. He seeks advice from Viper, who reveals that he served with Maverick's father Duke Mitchell on the <a href="/wiki/USS_Oriskany_(CV-34)" title="USS Oriskany (CV-34)">USS <i>Oriskany</i></a> and was in the air battle in which Mitchell was killed. Contrary to official reports which faulted Mitchell, Viper reveals classified information that proves Mitchell died heroically, and informs Maverick that he can succeed if he can regain his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate, though Iceman wins the Top Gun Trophy.
</p><p>During the graduation party, Viper calls in the newly graduated aviators with the orders to deploy. Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately return to <i>Enterprise</i> to deal with a "crisis situation", providing air support for the rescue of a stricken ship that has drifted into hostile waters.
</p><p>Maverick and Merlin (Cougar's former RIO) are assigned as back-up for F-14s flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman's reservations over Maverick's state of mind. The subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs sees Hollywood shot down; Maverick is scrambled alone due to a <a href="/wiki/Aircraft_catapult" title="Aircraft catapult">catapult</a> failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose's death. Upon finally rejoining Iceman, Maverick shoots down three MiGs, and Iceman one, forcing the other two to flee. Upon their triumphant return to <i>Enterprise</i>, Iceman and Maverick express newfound respect for each other.
</p><p>Offered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to Topgun as an instructor. At a bar in Miramar, Maverick and Charlie reunite.
</p><p>Dan Gallagher is a successful, happily married <a href="/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> lawyer whose work leads him to meet Alexandra "Alex" Forrest, an editor for a <a href="/wiki/Publishing" title="Publishing">publishing company</a>. While his wife, Beth, and daughter, Ellen, are out of town for the weekend, Dan has an affair with Alex. Though it was initially understood by both as just a fling, Alex starts clinging to him.
</p><p>Dan spends a second unplanned evening with Alex after she persistently asks him over. When Dan tries to leave, she cuts her wrists in a suicide attempt. He helps her bandage the cuts and then leaves. He thinks the affair is forgotten, but she shows up at various places to see him. She waits at his office one day to apologize and invites him to a performance of <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Madame_Butterfly" title="Madame Butterfly">Madame Butterfly</a></i>, but he politely turns her down. She then continues to call him until he tells his secretary that he will no longer take her calls. Alex then phones his home at all hours, claiming that she is pregnant and plans to keep the baby. Although he wants nothing to do with her, she argues that he must take responsibility. After he changes his home phone number, she shows up at his apartment (which is for sale) and meets Beth, feigning interest as a buyer. Later that night, Dan goes to Alex's apartment to confront her, which results in a scuffle. In response, she replies that she will not be ignored.
</p><p>Dan moves his family to <a href="/wiki/Bedford_(town),_New_York" title="Bedford (town), New York">Bedford</a>, but this does not deter Alex. She has a tape recording delivered to him filled with verbal abuse. She stalks him in a parking garage, pours acid on his car, and follows him home one night to spy on him, Beth, and Ellen from the bushes in their yard; the sight of their content family literally makes her sick to her stomach. Her obsession escalates further when Dan approaches the police to apply for a <a href="/wiki/Restraining_order" title="Restraining order">restraining order</a> against Alex (claiming that it is "for a client"). The lieutenant claims that he cannot violate her rights without <a href="/wiki/Probable_cause" title="Probable cause">probable cause</a>, and that the "client" has to own up to his <a href="/wiki/Adultery" title="Adultery">adultery</a>.
</p><p>At one point, while the Gallaghers are not home, Alex kills Ellen's pet rabbit, and puts it on their stove to boil. After this, Dan tells Beth of the affair and Alex's supposed pregnancy. Enraged, she demands that Dan leave. Before he goes, Dan calls Alex to tell her that Beth knows about the affair. Beth gets on the phone and warns Alex that she will kill her if she persists. Without Dan and Beth's knowledge, Alex picks up Ellen from school and takes her to an amusement park. Beth panics when she realizes that she does not know where Ellen is. She drives around frantically searching and rear-ends a car stopped at an intersection. Beth gets injured and is then hospitalized. Alex later takes Ellen home, asking her for a kiss on the cheek. Following Beth's release from the hospital, she forgives Dan and they return home.
</p><p>Dan barges into Alex's apartment and attacks her, choking her and coming close to strangling her. He stops himself, but as he does, she lunges at him with a kitchen knife. He overpowers her but decides to put the knife down and leave, while Alex is leaning against the kitchen counter, smiling. The police begin to search for her after Dan confronts them about having her arrested.
</p><p>Beth prepares a bath for herself when Alex suddenly appears, again with the kitchen knife. She starts to explain her resentment of Beth, nervously fidgeting (which causes Alex to cut her own leg) and then attacks Beth. Dan hears the screaming, rushes in, wrestles Alex into the bathtub, and seemingly drowns her. She suddenly emerges from the water, swinging the knife. Beth, who went searching for Dan's gun, shoots Alex in the chest, killing her. The final scene shows police cars outside the Gallaghers' house. As Dan finishes delivering his statement to the police, he walks inside, where Beth is waiting for him. They embrace and proceed to the living room as the camera focuses on a picture of them and Ellen.
</p><p>Charlie Babbitt is in the middle of importing four <a href="/wiki/Lamborghini" title="Lamborghini">Lamborghinis</a> to <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> for resale. He needs to deliver the vehicles to impatient buyers who have already made down payments in order to repay the loan he took out to buy the cars, but the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Environmental_Protection_Agency" title="United States Environmental Protection Agency">EPA</a> is holding the cars at the port due to the cars failing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emissions_regulations" title="Emissions regulations">emissions regulations</a>.

</p><p>When Charlie learns that his estranged father has died, he and his girlfriend Susanna travel to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cincinnati,_Ohio" title="Cincinnati, Ohio">Cincinnati, Ohio</a>, in order to settle the estate. He learns he is receiving the classic 1949 <a href="/wiki/Buick_Roadmaster" title="Buick Roadmaster">Buick Roadmaster</a> convertible which he and his father fought over, but the bulk of the $3 million estate is going to an unnamed <a href="/wiki/Trustee" title="Trustee">trustee</a>. Through <a href="/wiki/Social_engineering_(security)" title="Social engineering (security)">social engineering</a>, he learns the money is being directed to a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mental_institution" title="Mental institution">mental institution</a>, where he meets his elder brother, Raymond Babbitt, of whom he was previously unaware.
</p><p>Raymond has <a href="/wiki/Savant_syndrome" title="Savant syndrome">savant syndrome</a> and adheres to strict routines. He has <a href="/wiki/Eidetic_memory" title="Eidetic memory">superb recall</a>, but he shows little emotional expression except when in distress. Charlie spirits Raymond out of the mental institution and into a hotel for the night. Susanna becomes upset with the way Charlie treats his brother and leaves. Charlie asks Raymond's doctor, Dr. Gerald R. Bruner, for half the estate in exchange for Raymond's return, but he refuses. Charlie decides to attempt to gain custody of his brother in order to get control of the money.
</p><p>After Raymond refuses to fly back to Los Angeles, they set out on a cross-country road trip together. They make slow progress because Raymond insists on sticking to his routines, which include watching <a href="/wiki/Joseph_Wapner" title="Joseph Wapner">Judge Wapner</a> on television every day and getting to bed by 11:00 PM. He also objects to traveling on the <a href="/wiki/Interstate_Highway_System" title="Interstate Highway System">interstate</a> after they pass a bad accident. During the course of the journey, Charlie learns more about Raymond, including that he is a <a href="/wiki/Mental_calculator" title="Mental calculator">mental calculator</a> with the ability to instantly count hundreds of objects at once, far beyond the normal range of human <a href="/wiki/Subitizing" title="Subitizing">subitizing</a> abilities. He also learns that Raymond actually lived with the family when Charlie was young and he realizes that the comforting figure from his childhood, whom he falsely remembered as an imaginary friend named "Rain Man", was actually Raymond. He then figures that Raymond was sent away to the institution after he almost bathed a young Charlie in hot water.
</p><p>After the Lamborghinis are seized by his creditor, Charlie finds himself $80,000 in the hole and hatches a plan to return to <a href="/wiki/Las_Vegas_Strip" title="Las Vegas Strip">Las Vegas</a>, which they passed the night before, and win money at <a href="/wiki/Blackjack" title="Blackjack">blackjack</a> by <a href="/wiki/Card_counting" title="Card counting">counting cards</a>. Though the casino bosses are skeptical that anyone can count cards with a six deck <a href="/wiki/Shoe_(cards)" title="Shoe (cards)">shoe</a>, after reviewing security footage they ask Charlie and Raymond to leave. Charlie has made over $86,000 to cover his debts and has reconciled with Susanna who rejoined them in Las Vegas.
</p><p>Back in Los Angeles, Charlie meets with Dr. Bruner, who offers him $250,000 to walk away from Raymond. Charlie refuses and says that he is no longer upset about what his father left him, but he wants to have a relationship with his brother. At a meeting with a court-appointed psychiatrist, Raymond is shown to be unable to decide for himself what he wants. Charlie stops the questioning and tells Raymond he is happy to have him as his brother.
</p><p>Charlie takes Raymond to the train station where he boards an <a href="/wiki/Amtrak" title="Amtrak">Amtrak</a> train with Dr. Bruner to return to the mental institution. Charlie promises Raymond that he will visit in two weeks.
</p><p>In 1912, thirteen-year-old <a href="/wiki/Indiana_Jones" title="Indiana Jones">Henry "Indiana" Jones, Jr</a> is horseback riding with his <a href="/wiki/Boy_Scouts_of_America" title="Boy Scouts of America">Boy Scout</a> troop at <a href="/wiki/Arches_National_Park" title="Arches National Park">Arches National Park</a> in <a href="/wiki/Utah" title="Utah">Utah</a>. While scouting caves, Indy discovers a group of grave robbers who have found a golden <a href="/wiki/Crucifix" title="Crucifix">crucifix</a> belonging to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Francisco_V%C3%A1squez_de_Coronado" title="Francisco Vásquez de Coronado">Coronado</a> and steals it from them, hoping to donate it to a museum. The men give chase through a passing <a href="/wiki/Circus_train" title="Circus train">circus train</a>, leaving Indy with a bloody cut across his chin from a <a href="/wiki/Bullwhip" title="Bullwhip">bullwhip</a> and a new <a href="/wiki/Ophidiophobia" title="Ophidiophobia">phobia of snakes</a>. Indy escapes, but the local sheriff makes him return the cross to the robbers, who immediately turn it over to a mysterious benefactor wearing a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Panama_Hat" title="Panama Hat">Panama Hat</a>. Impressed with Indy's bravery, the leader of the robbers gives Indy his <a href="/wiki/Fedora" title="Fedora">fedora</a>, and tells him that he may have lost this battle, but that he does not have to like it.
</p><p>In 1938, Indy battles "Panama Hat" and his henchmen on a ship off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Estado_Novo_(Portugal)" title="Estado Novo (Portugal)">Portugal</a>. A violent <a href="/wiki/Gale" title="Gale">gale</a> ensues, and Indy escapes overboard just before the ship explodes. He recovers the cross and donates it to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Marcus_Brody" title="Marcus Brody">Marcus Brody</a>'s museum. Later, Indy is introduced to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Walter_Donovan" title="Walter Donovan">Walter Donovan</a>, who informs him that his father, <a href="/wiki/Henry_Jones,_Sr." title="Henry Jones, Sr.">Henry Jones, Sr.</a>, has vanished while searching for the <a href="/wiki/Holy_Grail" title="Holy Grail">Holy Grail</a>, using an incomplete inscription from a stone tablet as his guide. Indy receives Henry's Grail diary via mail from <a href="/wiki/Venice" title="Venice">Venice</a>. Realizing that he would not have sent the diary unless he was in trouble, Indy and Marcus travel to Venice, where they meet Henry's <a href="/wiki/Federal_State_of_Austria" title="Federal State of Austria">Austrian</a> colleague Dr. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Elsa_Schneider" title="Elsa Schneider">Elsa Schneider</a>. Beneath the library where Henry was last seen, Indy and Elsa discover a set of half-flooded catacombs that house the tomb of a <a href="/wiki/First_Crusade" title="First Crusade">First Crusade</a> knight, which contains a complete version of the inscription that Henry had used, revealing the location of the Grail. They flee when the <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">petroleum</a>-saturated waters of the catacombs are set aflame by the Brotherhood of the Cruciform Sword, a <a href="/wiki/Secret_society" title="Secret society">secret society</a> that protects the Grail from evildoers. Indy and Elsa capture one of the Brotherhood, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Indiana_Jones_series#Kazim" title="List of characters in the Indiana Jones series">Kazim</a>, who tells Indy where Henry is being held after Indy explains that his only goal is to find Henry, not the Grail. Marcus reveals a map drawn by Henry of the route to the Grail, which begins in Alexandretta. Indy removes the map from the diary, gives it to Marcus for safekeeping, and sends him to <a href="/wiki/%C4%B0skenderun" title="İskenderun">İskenderun</a>, the city built on the ruins of Alexandretta, to rendezvous with their old friend <a href="/wiki/Sallah" title="Sallah">Sallah</a>.
</p><p>Indy and Elsa head to a <a href="/wiki/Nazi_Germany" title="Nazi Germany">Nazi</a>-controlled castle where Henry is being held. Indy finds Henry, but learns that both Elsa and Donovan are actually working with the Nazis and are using the Joneses to find the Grail for them. Meanwhile, Marcus is captured in <a href="/wiki/Hatay_State" title="Hatay State">Hatay</a>, while waiting with Sallah. After escaping from the castle, Henry tells Indy that the Grail is guarded by three <a href="/wiki/Booby_trap" title="Booby trap">booby traps</a> and his diary contains the clues needed to pass them safely. They recover the diary from Elsa at a <a href="/wiki/Nazi_book_burnings" title="Nazi book burnings">book burning</a> rally in <a href="/wiki/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a>, briefly coming face-to-face with <a href="/wiki/Adolf_Hitler" title="Adolf Hitler">Hitler</a>. They board a <a href="/wiki/Zeppelin" title="Zeppelin">Zeppelin</a> to leave Germany, but the Nazis discover the Joneses are aboard and they escape in a <a href="/wiki/Parasite_aircraft" title="Parasite aircraft">parasite</a> <a href="/wiki/Biplane" title="Biplane">biplane</a>. They crash while engaging in a <a href="/wiki/Dogfight" title="Dogfight">dogfight</a> with <a href="/wiki/Luftwaffe" title="Luftwaffe">Luftwaffe</a> fighters.
</p><p>The two meet up with Sallah in Hatay, where they learn of Marcus' abduction. The Nazis are already moving toward the Grail's location, using the map possessed by Marcus. In exchange for a <a href="/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Phantom_II" title="Rolls-Royce Phantom II">Rolls-Royce</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Sultan" title="Sultan">Sultan</a> of Hatay has given the Nazis full access to his equipment for the expedition, including a large tank. Indy, Henry, and Sallah find the Nazi expedition, which is ambushed by the Brotherhood. During the battle, Henry is captured by SS Colonel <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_characters_in_the_Indiana_Jones_series#Vogel" title="List of characters in the Indiana Jones series">Ernst Vogel</a> while attempting to rescue Marcus from the tank; Kazim and his comrades are killed. Indy pursues the tank on horseback and, with the aid of Sallah, saves Henry and Marcus. He is caught up in a fight with Vogel, and barely escapes before the tank goes over a cliff, sending Vogel to his death.
</p><p>Indy, Henry, Marcus, and Sallah catch up with the surviving Nazis, led by Donovan and Elsa, who have found the temple where the Holy Grail is kept but their men are unable to pass through the three protective booby traps. Donovan shoots and mortally wounds Henry in order to force Indy to risk his life in the traps to find the Grail and use its healing power to save his father. Using the information in the diary and followed by Donovan and Elsa, Indy safely overcomes the traps and reaches the Grail's chamber, which is guarded by a knight. He has been kept alive for 700 years by the power of the Grail, which is hidden among dozens of false grails; only the true Grail grants eternal life, while a false one will kill the drinker. Elsa selects a golden chalice studded with emeralds for Donovan, who rapidly ages into dust after drinking from it, proving it to be false. Indy selects a simple <a href="/wiki/Ceramic" title="Ceramic">ceramic</a> cup,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup> and the knight tells him that he has "chosen wisely," but warns that the Holy Grail cannot be taken beyond the temple's entrance. Indy fills the Grail with <a href="/wiki/Holy_water" title="Holy water">holy water</a> and gives it to Henry, healing him instantly. Elsa disregards the knight's warning and tries to take the Grail with her, causing the temple to collapse around them. When the Grail falls into a chasm in the floor, Elsa plummets to her death trying to recover it. Indy nearly suffers the same fate before Henry urges him to leave it. The Joneses, Marcus, and Sallah escape the temple and ride off into the sunset.
</p><p>Sam Wheat, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Banker" title="Banker">banker</a>, and his girlfriend Molly Jensen, a <a href="/wiki/Pottery" title="Pottery">potter</a>, renovate and move into an apartment in <a href="/wiki/Manhattan" title="Manhattan">Manhattan</a> with the help of Sam's friend and co-worker Carl Bruner. One afternoon, Sam confides in Carl his discovery of unusually high balances in obscure bank accounts. He decides to investigate the matter himself, declining Carl's offer of assistance. That night, Sam and Molly are attacked by a <a href="/wiki/Robbery" title="Robbery">mugger</a> who shoots and kills Sam in a scuffle before stealing his wallet. Sam sees Molly crying over his body and discovers he is now a <a href="/wiki/Ghost" title="Ghost">ghost</a>, invisible and unable to interact with the mortal world.
</p><p>Molly remains distraught in the days after Sam's death, as Sam remains close to her. Carl comes over and suggests Molly take a walk with him and Sam cannot bring himself to follow. Moments later, the mugger enters the apartment in search of something. When Molly returns, Sam scares their cat into attacking the thug, who flees. Sam follows the mugger to his <a href="/wiki/Brooklyn" title="Brooklyn">Brooklyn</a> apartment and learns that the man, Willie Lopez, was sent by an unknown party.
</p><p>After leaving Willie's residence, Sam happens upon the parlor of <a href="/wiki/Psychic" title="Psychic">psychic</a> Oda Mae Brown, a <a href="/wiki/Charlatan" title="Charlatan">charlatan</a> pretending to <a href="/wiki/Mediumship" title="Mediumship">commune with spirits of the dead</a> who is shocked to discover her true psychic gift when she can hear Sam speaking. Sam persuades her to warn Molly that she is in danger. To allay Molly's skepticism, Oda Mae relays information that only Sam could know. Molly gives Willie's address to Carl; she then goes to the police, who have no file for Willie but they show her Oda Mae's lengthy one as a forger and con artist.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Sam follows Carl and is devastated to learn he and Willie are working together. Carl is <a href="/wiki/Money_laundering" title="Money laundering">laundering money</a> for drug dealers and he had Willie rob Sam to get his apartment key, which Carl uses to obtain Sam's book of passwords and transfer the money into a single account under the fictitious "Rita Miller".
</p><p>Sam learns from a violent <a href="/wiki/Poltergeist" title="Poltergeist">poltergeist</a> haunting the <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Subway" title="New York City Subway">subway system</a> how to manipulate objects with his mind. Sam then persuades Oda Mae to help him thwart Carl. Before Carl can transfer the money for his clients, Oda Mae impersonates Rita Miller, closes the account, and reluctantly gives the $4 million cashier's check to charity. As Carl desperately searches for the money, Sam reveals his presence by typing his name on the computer keyboard. Carl goes to Molly, who reveals she spotted Oda Mae closing an account at the bank. Carl and Willie go to Oda Mae's place but Sam warns her and her sisters to take shelter. When Willie arrives, Sam tosses objects at him, who flees into the street in a fit of panic and is killed by an oncoming car. Shadowy creatures emerge from the darkness to drag Willie's ghost down to <a href="/wiki/Hell" title="Hell">Hell</a>.
</p><p>Sam and Oda Mae return to the apartment where—by levitating a penny into Molly's hand—he convinces Molly that Oda Mae is telling the truth about him. Oda Mae allows Sam to <a href="/wiki/Spirit_possession" title="Spirit possession">possess her body</a> so he and Molly can share a slow dance. Carl breaks into the apartment but Sam is too exhausted from the possession to fight Carl. The women run onto the fire escape, to a loft under construction, but Carl catches Oda Mae and holds her at gunpoint, demanding the check. A recovered Sam pushes Carl off her so Carl takes Molly hostage, pleading with Sam for the check. Sam disarms Carl and attacks him again. Carl tries to escape through a window and tosses a suspended hook at Sam, but the hook swings back, shatters the window and it slides down, fatally impaling and killing Carl with a glass shard. The shadowy creatures return to claim Carl's ghost for Hell.
</p><p>Sam asks if the women are all right. Miraculously, Molly can now hear him. A heavenly light shines in the room, illuminating Sam's presence. Realizing that it is time for him to go with his task now completed, he and Molly share a tearful goodbye and one final kiss. Sam thanks Oda Mae for her help and then walks into the light and onward to <a href="/wiki/Heaven" title="Heaven">Heaven</a>.

They encounter Sarah as she is escaping from the hospital, although she is initially reluctant to trust the T-800.

</p><p>The T-1000 and the T-800 engage in physical combat and the more advanced model seriously damages and shuts down the T-800. However, unbeknownst to the T-1000, the T-800 brings itself back online using emergency power. The T-1000 nearly kills John and Sarah but the T-800 takes it by surprise and blasts it into a vat of molten steel with an <a href="/wiki/M79_grenade_launcher" title="M79 grenade launcher">M79 grenade launcher</a>, destroying it. John tosses the arm and CPU of the original Terminator into the vat as well. As Sarah expresses relief that the ordeal is over, the Terminator explains that to ensure that it is not used for reverse engineering it must also be destroyed. It asks Sarah to assist in lowering it into the vat of molten steel, since it is unable to "self-terminate". Although John begs and eventually orders the Terminator to reconsider, it makes the decision to disobey him, bids them farewell and hugs a tearful John before it is lowered into the vat, giving a final thumbs-up as it disappears into the molten steel. John and Sarah drive down a highway and  Sarah says in a voice over, “The unknown future rolls toward us. I face it for the first time with a sense of hope. Because if a machine, a Terminator, can learn the value of human life, maybe we can too."
</p><p>Jafar, the Royal Vizier of the fictional city of Agrabah, placed near the <a href="/wiki/Jordan_River" title="Jordan River">Jordan River</a>, and his parrot Iago seek a lamp hidden within the Cave of Wonders. They are told that only one person is worthy to enter: "the diamond in the rough", whom Jafar later identifies Aladdin, an Agrabah street urchin. Princess Jasmine of Agrabah, upset that the law requires her to marry a prince instead of one she loves, escapes the palace and meets Aladdin and his pet monkey, Abu. The palace guards capture Aladdin on Jafar's orders. Jasmine confronts Jafar to demand Aladdin's release, but he lies and says that Aladdin has been executed.
</p><p>Disguised as an old man, Jafar frees Aladdin and Abu and brings them to the cave, ordering them to retrieve the lamp. Inside, Aladdin finds a <a href="/wiki/Magic_carpet" title="Magic carpet">magic carpet</a> and obtains the lamp. Defying Aladdin's instruction to touch nothing but the lamp, Abu grabs a jewel. Aladdin, Abu, and the carpet rush to escape the cave as it collapses. Aladdin gives the lamp to Jafar, who throws both Aladdin and Abu back into the cave, though not before Abu steals the lamp back. Trapped, Aladdin rubs the lamp and meets the Genie who lives inside it. The Genie grants Aladdin three wishes. Aladdin tricks the Genie into freeing them all from the cave without using a wish. He uses his first wish to assume the identity of a prince to woo Jasmine, and promises to use his third wish to free the Genie from servitude.
</p><p>At Iago's suggestion, Jafar plots to become Sultan by marrying Jasmine. Aladdin, as "Prince Ali Ababwa", arrives in Agrabah with a large host, but Jasmine becomes angry when he discusses her fate with her father the Sultan and Jafar without her. As a means of apologizing, Aladdin takes Jasmine on a ride on the magic carpet. When she deduces his true identity, he convinces her that he only dresses as a <a href="/wiki/Peasant" title="Peasant">peasant</a> to escape the stresses of royal life. After Aladdin brings Jasmine home, the palace guards capture Aladdin on Jafar's behest and throw him into the sea. The Genie appears, intuits that the unconscious Aladdin would want to use his second wish to be rescued, and saves him. Aladdin returns to the palace and exposes Jafar's evil plot. Jafar flees after spotting the lamp and thus discovering Aladdin's true identity.
</p><p>Fearing that he will lose Jasmine if the truth is revealed, Aladdin breaks his promise and refuses to free the Genie. Iago steals the lamp, and Jafar becomes the Genie's new master. He uses his first two wishes to become Sultan and the world's most powerful sorcerer. He then exposes Aladdin's identity and exiles him, Abu, and the carpet to a frozen wasteland. They escape and return to the palace. Jasmine tries to help Aladdin steal the lamp back, but Jafar notices and overpowers the heroes with his magic. Aladdin taunts Jafar for being less powerful than the Genie, tricking Jafar into using his last wish to become an all-powerful genie himself. Now bound to his new lamp, Jafar ends up trapped inside it, taking Iago with him.
</p><p>With Agrabah returned to normal, the Genie banishes Jafar's lamp and advises Aladdin use his third wish to regain his royal title so the law will allow him to stay with Jasmine. Aladdin decides instead to keep his promise and free the Genie. Realizing Aladdin and Jasmine's love, the Sultan changes the law to allow Jasmine to marry whom she chooses. The Genie leaves to explore the world, while Aladdin and Jasmine start their new life together.
</p><p>Industrialist John Hammond and his <a href="/wiki/Biological_engineering" title="Biological engineering">bioengineering</a> company, InGen, have created a <a href="/wiki/Animal_theme_park" title="Animal theme park">theme park</a> featuring cloned dinosaurs and prehistoric plants, called Jurassic Park, on <a href="/wiki/Isla_Nublar" title="Isla Nublar">Isla Nublar</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rican</a> island. After a dinosaur handler is killed by a <i><a href="/wiki/Velociraptor" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a></i>, the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro, demand that experts visit the park and certify it is safe. To perform the inspection, Gennaro invites <a href="/wiki/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chaos_theory" title="Chaos theory">chaos theorist</a> Ian Malcolm, while Hammond invites <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paleontologist" title="Paleontologist">paleontologist</a> Dr. Alan Grant and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paleobotanist" title="Paleobotanist">paleobotanist</a> Dr. Ellie Sattler. Upon arrival, the group is shocked to see a live <i><a href="/wiki/Brachiosaurus" title="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a></i>, in addition to two more with a herd of <i><a href="/wiki/Parasaurolophus" title="Parasaurolophus">Parasaurolophus</a></i>.
</p><p>At the park's visitor center, the group learns the cloning was accomplished by extracting <a href="/wiki/Ancient_DNA" title="Ancient DNA">dinosaur DNA</a> from <a href="/wiki/Mosquito" title="Mosquito">mosquitoes</a> preserved in <a href="/wiki/Amber" title="Amber">amber</a>. DNA from <a href="/wiki/Frog" title="Frog">frogs</a> was used to fill in gaps in the dinosaurs' <a href="/wiki/Genome" title="Genome">genome</a>. To prevent breeding, all the dinosaurs were made female. Malcolm scoffs at the idea, saying it will inevitably break down. The group witnesses the hatching of a baby <i><a href="/wiki/Velociraptor" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a></i> and visits the raptor enclosure. At lunch, the group debates the <a href="/wiki/Ethics_of_cloning" title="Ethics of cloning">ethics of cloning</a> and the creation of the park. Malcolm gives a harsh warning about the implications of <a href="/wiki/Genetic_engineering" title="Genetic engineering">genetic engineering</a>.
</p><p>The group is joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Tim and Lex, for a tour of the park, while Hammond oversees the tour from the park's control room. The tour does not go as planned. Most of the dinosaurs fail to appear and the group encounters a sick <i><a href="/wiki/Triceratops" title="Triceratops">Triceratops</a></i>. It is cut short as a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" title="Tropical cyclone">tropical storm</a> approaches Isla Nublar. Most park employees leave for the mainland on a boat, while the visitors return to their electric tour vehicles. Sattler stays behind with the park's veterinarian to study the <i>Triceratops</i>.
</p><p>Jurassic Park's lead computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, has been bribed by Dodgson, a man working for Hammond's corporate rival, to steal fertilized dinosaur <a href="/wiki/Embryo" title="Embryo">embryos</a>. Nedry deactivates the park's security system to gain access to the embryo storage room and puts the stolen embryos inside a canister disguised as a <a href="/wiki/Barbasol" title="Barbasol">Barbasol</a> shaving-cream can. The power goes out, stalling the tour vehicles. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated, allowing the <i><a href="/wiki/Tyrannosaurus" title="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></i> to escape and attack the group. Grant and Hammond's grandchildren survive. The <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro. While taking the embryos to the island's dock, Nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes his <a href="/wiki/Jeep_Wrangler" title="Jeep Wrangler">Jeep Wrangler</a>, and is killed by a <i><a href="/wiki/Dilophosaurus" title="Dilophosaurus">Dilophosaurus</a></i>.
</p><p>Sattler helps the park's game warden, Robert Muldoon, search for survivors. They find only Malcolm before the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> returns. Grant, Tim, and Lex take shelter in a treetop. They later discover broken dinosaur egg shells. Grant concludes the dinosaurs have been breeding. This occurred because their West African frog DNA—<a href="/wiki/Common_reed_frog" title="Common reed frog">Common reed frog</a> can change their sex in a single-sex environment, allowing the dinosaurs to do so as well, proving Malcolm right.
</p><p>Unable to decipher Nedry's code to reactivate the security system, Hammond and the park's chief engineer Ray Arnold reboot the park's system. The group shuts down the park's grid and retreats to an emergency bunker, while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When Arnold fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head to the shed. They discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining fences and released the <i>Velociraptors</i>. Muldoon distracts the raptors, while Sattler goes to turn the power back on. As she is turning the power on, Grant, Lex and Tim are climbing the perimeter fence. Grant and Lex make it down in time but Tim is electrocuted. Grant gives Tim <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CPR" title="CPR">CPR</a> and he survives. Sattler is attacked by a raptor and discovers Arnold's severed arm. Muldoon is caught off guard and killed by the other two raptors.
</p><p>After encountering a <i><a href="/wiki/Brachiosaurus" title="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a></i> and narrowly escaping the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> during a <i><a href="/wiki/Gallimimus" title="Gallimimus">Gallimimus</a></i> stampede, Grant, Tim, and Lex reach the visitor center. Grant heads out to look for Sattler, leaving Tim and Lex inside. They are pursued by the raptors in an industrial kitchen but escape and join Grant and Sattler. Lex restores full power from the control room, allowing them to call Hammond, who in turn calls for help. Grant, Tim, Lex, and Sattler are cornered by the raptors, but they escape when the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> suddenly appears and kills the raptors. Hammond arrives in a jeep with Malcolm, and the survivors board a helicopter to leave the island.
</p><p>In the Pride Lands of <a href="/wiki/Africa" title="Africa">Africa</a>, a pride of lions rule over the animal kingdom from Pride Rock. King Mufasa's and Queen Sarabi's newborn son, <a href="/wiki/Simba" title="Simba">Simba</a> (whose name is <a href="/wiki/Swahili_language" title="Swahili language">Swahili</a> for lion<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-4"><a href="#cite_note-4">[4]</a></sup>), is presented to the gathering animals by Rafiki the baboon (with the colorful facial marking of a <a href="/wiki/Mandrill" title="Mandrill">mandrill</a>)<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-grasset_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-grasset-5">[5]</a></sup> who serves as the <a href="/wiki/Shamanism" title="Shamanism">shaman</a> and advisor. Mufasa shows Simba the Pride Lands and explains to him the responsibilities of kingship and the "circle of life", which connects all living things. Mufasa's younger brother, <a href="/wiki/Scar_(The_Lion_King)" title="Scar (The Lion King)">Scar</a>, covets the throne and plots to eliminate Mufasa and Simba, so he may become king. He tricks Simba and his best friend Nala (to whom Simba is betrothed) into exploring a forbidden <a href="/wiki/Elephants%27_graveyard" title="Elephants' graveyard">elephants' graveyard</a>, where they are attacked by three <a href="/wiki/Spotted_hyena" title="Spotted hyena">spotted hyenas</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_characters_in_The_Lion_King#Shenzi,_Banzai_and_Ed" title="List of characters in The Lion King">Shenzi, Banzai, and Ed</a>, who are in league with Scar. Mufasa is alerted about the incident by his <a href="/wiki/Majordomo" title="Majordomo">majordomo</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Hornbill" title="Hornbill">hornbill</a> Zazu, and rescues the cubs. Though upset with Simba, Mufasa forgives him and explains that the great kings of the past watch over them from the night sky, from which he will one day watch over Simba.
</p><p>Scar sets a trap for his brother and nephew, luring Simba into a gorge and having the hyenas drive a large herd of <a href="/wiki/Wildebeest" title="Wildebeest">wildebeest</a> into a stampede that will trample him. He informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing that the king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge. Scar refuses to help Mufasa, instead sending him falling to his death. He then convinces Simba that the tragedy was Simba's own fault and advises him to leave the kingdom and never return. He orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing his three hyena minions and the rest of their large pack to live in the Pride Lands.
</p><p>Simba collapses in a desert and is rescued by <a href="/wiki/Timon_and_Pumbaa" title="Timon and Pumbaa">Timon and Pumbaa</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Meerkat" title="Meerkat">meerkat</a> and <a href="/wiki/Common_warthog" title="Common warthog">warthog</a>, who are fellow outcasts. Simba grows up in the jungle with his two new friends, living a carefree life under the motto "<a href="/wiki/Hakuna_matata" title="Hakuna matata">hakuna matata</a>" ("no worries" in <a href="/wiki/Swahili_language" title="Swahili language">Swahili</a>). Now a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reunite and fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him that Pride Lands have become a drought-stricken wasteland under Scar's reign. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He then encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him that he must take his rightful place as king. Realizing that he can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.
</p><p>Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who had just struck Sarabi. Scar taunts Simba over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to him that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame the hyenas for his actions; Simba spares his life, but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever (just like Scar demanded Simba to do when he was a cub). Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to toss him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. Afterwards, Simba takes over the kingship as rain begins to fall. He also makes Nala his queen.
</p><p>Later, with Pride Rock restored to its usual state, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of life.
</p><p>In a world where toys are living things but pretend to be lifeless when humans are present, a group of toys, owned by a boy named Andy Davis, are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as his family (including his mother and infant sister Molly) is preparing to move the following week. Andy's toys – including Bo Peep the shepherdess, Mr. Potato Head, Rex the dinosaur, Hamm the piggy bank and Slinky Dog – fear they will be replaced by new toys from the birthday. A pull-string cowboy doll named Sheriff Woody – the toys' leader and Andy's favorite toy – sends out <a href="/wiki/Army_men" title="Army men">army men</a>, led by Sergeant, to spy on the party and report the gift results to the others via <a href="/wiki/Baby_monitor" title="Baby monitor">baby monitors</a>. The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them being replaced by new toys, but then Andy receives a surprise gift – a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who thinks he is a real space ranger.
</p><p>Buzz impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, making Woody feel abandoned. As Andy prepares for a family outing at Pizza Planet, his mother allows him to bring one toy. Fearing Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap him behind a desk, but ends up accidentally knocking him out of a window. The other toys, except Bo Peep and Slinky, rebel against Woody, believing he did harm to Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, Andy takes Woody and leaves for Pizza Planet. When the family stops for gas, Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on their van. They have a fight, only to find the family has left without them. They manage to make their way to the restaurant by stowing away on a pizza delivery truck. Buzz, still thinking he is a real space ranger, despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a crane game, where they are won by Andy's toy-abusing neighbor, a boy named Sid Phillips.
</p><p>Woody attempts to escape from Sid's house, but Buzz, finally realizing he is a toy after watching a Buzz Lightyear TV ad and trying and failing to fly out a window, sinks into despondency. Sid plans to launch Buzz on a fireworks rocket, but his plans are delayed by a thunderstorm. Woody tells Buzz about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy, restoring his confidence. The next day, Woody and Sid's mutant creature toys rescue Buzz just as Sid is about to launch the rocket and scare Sid into no longer abusing toys, and he runs into his house screaming in horror. Woody and Buzz leave just as Andy and his family drive away toward their new home.
</p><p>The duo tries to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog, Scud, sees them and gives chase. Buzz gets left behind while saving Woody from Scud, and Woody tries rescuing him with Andy's radio-controlled car (RC). Thinking that Woody is trying to get rid of RC as well, the other toys attack and toss him off the truck. Having evaded Scud, Buzz and RC retrieve Woody and continue to chase the truck. Upon seeing Woody and Buzz together on RC, the other toys realize their mistake and try to help them get back aboard, but RC's batteries become depleted, stranding them. Buzz realizes Sid's rocket is still strapped to his back, and they ignite it, hurtling them toward the truck. Woody manages to throw RC into the truck before they soar into the air, and Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket before it explodes, gliding with Woody to land safely into a box in the van, right next to Andy. Andy is delighted to see his favorite toys again.
</p><p>On Christmas Day, at their new house, Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals. One of the toys is Mrs. Potato Head, much to Mr. Potato Head's delight. As Woody jokingly asks what might be worse than Buzz, they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Bonwit_Teller" title="Bonwit Teller">Bonwit Teller</a> department store is destroyed by a bomb during the morning commute. The <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department" title="New York City Police Department">New York City Police Department</a> gets a call from "Simon", the terrorist, ordering that suspended police officer Lt. <a href="/wiki/John_McClane" title="John McClane">John McClane</a> be dropped in <a href="/wiki/Harlem" title="Harlem">Harlem</a> wearing only his underwear and a <a href="/wiki/Sandwich_board" title="Sandwich board">sandwich board</a> with "I Hate Niggers" written on it, and threatening to detonate another bomb if they do not comply. After locating a hung-over McClane, the NYPD complies. McClane is saved from an angry group of black men by Zeus Carver, a nearby locksmith and shop owner, and they take a cab to NYPD headquarters. While at headquarters, the NYPD is briefed by explosives expert Charlie, who introduces them to the binary liquids Simon is using to create his powerful explosives, and they learn that two thousand pounds had been recently stolen. Simon calls again and demands that both McClane and Carver follow his continuing instructions.
</p><p>Simon sends the two on a series of children's riddles, which ultimately require them to reach the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Wall_Street_(IRT_Broadway_%E2%80%93_Seventh_Avenue_Line)" title="Wall Street (IRT Broadway – Seventh Avenue Line)">Wall Street subway station</a> 90 blocks south within 30 minutes to stop a bomb planted on a Brooklyn-bound <a href="/wiki/3_(New_York_City_Subway_service)" title="3 (New York City Subway service)">3 train</a>. McClane boards the subway while Carver drives to the stop. Though Carver answers Simon's call and McClane locates the bomb, Simon detonates it immediately after McClane throws it off the train in the station, derailing the train and damaging the subway station. As McClane and Carver regroup with the police, they are met by <a href="/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</a> agents, who reveal Simon is "Peter Krieg", a former Colonel in the East German <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volksarmee" title="Volksarmee">People's Army</a> and a mercenary-for-hire. However, Krieg's real name is Simon Peter Gruber, the brother of Hans Gruber -- whom McClane had killed <a href="/wiki/Die_Hard" title="Die Hard">years earlier in Los Angeles</a>. 
</p><p>Simon then calls the police, knowing the FBI is there, to inform them that he has placed a bomb in a NYC public school that is rigged with a radio detonator triggered by the use of the FBI and police bands. Simon tells them that he will give McClane and Carver the school's location if they continue to play his game. While McClane and Carver set off on Simon's next task, the police organize all NYC's public works to search schools, using <a href="/wiki/9-1-1" title="9-1-1">9-1-1</a> to coordinate activities. As McClane and Carver solves Simon's riddles, McClane realizes that Simon is using the school bomb as a distraction to draw the police away from the bomb damage at Wall Street. They return there to find that Simon and his team used fake repair crews to dig into the <a href="/wiki/Federal_Reserve_Bank_of_New_York" title="Federal Reserve Bank of New York">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a> and steal $140 billion of <a href="/wiki/Precious_metal#Bullion" title="Precious metal">gold bullion</a> in dump trucks. They follow the trucks to an <a href="/wiki/Aqueduct_(water_supply)" title="Aqueduct (water supply)">aqueduct</a> in the <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Water_Tunnel_No._3" title="New York City Water Tunnel No. 3">New York City Water Tunnel No. 3</a>. McClane then follows the trucks, while Carver continues with Simon's games. 
</p><p>Within the tunnel McClane kills some of Simon's men, discovering they have a pre-wrapped roll of quarters on them. Simon destroys a <a href="/wiki/Cofferdam" title="Cofferdam">cofferdam</a>, flooding the tunnel, but McClane escapes through a vent, ending up near Carver. After surviving a car chase with Simon's men who had followed Carver and finding that they also had a pre-wrapped roll of quarters, they realize that the roll of quarters would pay for a toll bridge, and they head to a tanker vessel in the <a href="/wiki/Long_Island_Sound" title="Long Island Sound">Long Island Sound</a>. They sneak aboard, learning that the bullion isn't there, but are both captured. 
</p><p>Simon confirms McClane's suspicions that the school bomb (which had been found using the clues provided by Simon, but turned out to be a dummy) was a trick to distract police before handcuffing the two to the real bomb. He says he is going to destroy the tanker, redistributing the bullion across the Sound, to destroy the economies of the world. Before Simon leaves, McClane jokingly asks him for some aspirin for his hangover, much to Simon's amusement. He happens to have a bottle of aspirin and tosses it to McClane. After Simon leaves, McClane passes a cable splinter to Carver, who picks the handcuffs to free them. They barely escape before the bomb detonates, sinking the tanker.
</p><p>As McClane and Carver are debriefed by the police, McClane reports that none of the bullion was on the tanker. McClane notices the bottle of aspirin came from a truckstop located in <a href="/wiki/Quebec" title="Quebec">Quebec</a> at the Canada-US border. McClane, Carver, and the police arrive at a warehouse near the truckstop where Simon and his men are in the process of distributing the bullion and planning their escape. The rest of Simon's men are captured, while Simon and his girlfriend Katya attempt to escape in a helicopter, stopping to fire upon McClane and Carver. McClane, armed only with a small revolver, shoots an overhead power line that falls onto the helicopter, crashing it and killing Simon and Katya. Carver then convinces McClane to call his estranged wife, <a href="/wiki/John_McClane#Family" title="John McClane">Holly</a>.

After <a href="/wiki/United_States_Secret_Service" title="United States Secret Service">Secret Service</a> agents and military personnel kill the alien which leaves Dr. Okun in a coma, Whitmore reluctantly authorizes a nuclear attack; a <a href="/wiki/Northrop_Grumman_B-2_Spirit" title="Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit">B-2 Spirit</a> fires a nuclear warhead tipped cruise missile at a saucer positioned above <a href="/wiki/Houston" title="Houston">Houston</a>, but the saucer remains intact, whilst wiping out the city.
</p><p>On <a href="/wiki/Independence_Day_(United_States)" title="Independence Day (United States)">July 4</a>, David demonstrates the key to defeating the aliens is to deactivate their force fields, and devises a plan to do this by uploading a <a href="/wiki/Computer_virus" title="Computer virus">computer virus</a> into the mothership using the refurbished alien fighter, which Steven volunteers to pilot. The U.S military establishes contacts with other airborne squadrons around the world through <a href="/wiki/Morse_code" title="Morse code">Morse code</a>, working with them to organize a united counter-offense against the aliens. With military pilots in short supply, Whitmore enlists the help of volunteers with flight experience, including Russell, to fly the remaining F/A-18s at Area 51; and leads an attack on a saucer bearing down on the base. Flying into space, Steven and David upload the virus and successfully deploy a nuclear weapon on board the mothership, blowing it to pieces. With the aliens' shields deactivated, the fighter jets are able to successfully fight back against the enemy craft, but their supply of missiles is exhausted before they can destroy the ship. As the ship prepares to fire on the base, Russell has one last missile to spare, but when the firing control on the missile fails, he bravely <a href="/wiki/Kamikaze" title="Kamikaze">rams</a> his jet into the directed-energy weapon port, causing a chain reaction that destroys the entire ship. Human resistance forces around the world are informed of the alien ships' weak point, and successfully destroy the other saucers. As humankind is rejoicing in victory, Steven and David return to Area 51 unharmed and reunite with their families. They then accompany Whitmore and his daughter in watching the wreckage from the mothership blowing up, resembling a <a href="/wiki/Fireworks" title="Fireworks">fireworks</a> display as it enters Earth's atmosphere.
</p><p>In 1996, treasure hunter Brock Lovett and his team aboard the research vessel <i><a href="/wiki/Akademik_Mstislav_Keldysh" title="Akademik Mstislav Keldysh">Akademik Mstislav Keldysh</a></i> search the wreck of RMS <i>Titanic</i> for a necklace with a rare diamond, the <a href="/wiki/Heart_of_the_Ocean" title="Heart of the Ocean">Heart of the Ocean</a>. They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[Note 1]</a></sup> Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard <i>Keldysh</i> and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard <i>Titanic</i>.
</p><p>In 1912 <a href="/wiki/Southampton" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>, 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fiancé Cal Hockley, and her mother Ruth board the luxurious <i>Titanic</i>. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve their family's financial problems and retain their high-class persona. Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class.
</p><p>Aware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cal's bodyguard, Mr. Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with an iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.
</p><p>Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Lovejoy slips the necklace into Jack's pocket and he and Cal accuse him of theft. Jack is arrested, taken to the <a href="/wiki/Master-at-arms" title="Master-at-arms">master-at-arms</a>' office, and handcuffed to a pipe. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.
</p><p>With the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.
</p><p>After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for only one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of <a href="/wiki/Hypothermia" title="Hypothermia">hypothermia</a><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Carlson_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Carlson-9">[8]</a></sup> but Rose is saved.
</p><p>With Rose hiding from Cal en route, the <a href="/wiki/RMS_Carpathia" title="RMS Carpathia">RMS <i>Carpathia</i></a> takes the survivors to New York City where Rose gives her name as Rose Dawson. Rose says she later read that Cal committed suicide after losing all his money in the <a href="/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929" title="Wall Street Crash of 1929">Wall Street Crash of 1929</a>.
</p><p>Back in the present, Lovett decides to abandon his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of <i>Keldysh</i>, Rose takes out the Heart of the Ocean – in her possession all along – and drops it into the sea over the wreck site. While she is seemingly asleep or has died in her bed,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-comm-sleep-or-dead_10-0"><a href="#cite_note-comm-sleep-or-dead-10">[9]</a></sup> photos on her dresser depict a life of freedom and adventure inspired by the life she wanted to live with Jack.

NASA scientists, led by Dan Truman (Thornton) plan to drill a shaft into the asteroids' surface of at least 800 ft. (243 m) deep, and plant a H-bomb device into it which, when detonated, will split the asteroid in two, driving the halves apart so that they both will fly safely past the Earth. NASA contacts Harry Stamper (Willis), considered the best deep-sea oil driller in the world, for assistance and advice. Harry returns to NASA along with his daughter Grace (Tyler) to keep her away from her new boyfriend, one of Harry's young and rambunctious drillers, A.J. Frost (Affleck). Harry and Grace learn about the asteroid and Harry explains he will need his team, including A.J., Charles "Chick" Chapel (Patton), Rockhound (Buscemi), Max Lennert (Campbell), Oscar Choice (Wilson), J. Otis "Bear" Curlene (Duncan) and Freddie Noonan (Brolly) to carry out the mission. Once they have been rounded up and the situation is explained, they agree to help, but only after their list of unusual rewards and demands are met. As NASA puts Harry and his crew through a short and rigorous 12-day astronaut training program at the <a href="/wiki/Johnson_Space_Center" title="Johnson Space Center">Johnson Space Center</a>, Harry and his team re-outfit the mobile drillers, named the "Armadillos", that will be used on the asteroid. When a meteorite from the asteroid wipes out the coastal area of <a href="/wiki/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, NASA and other space agencies are forced to reveal their plans to the world before Harry and his crew go to Florida for training revisions and last-minute preparations. Afterwards, two of the latest X-71 Space Shuttles, called the <i>Freedom</i> and the <i>Independence</i>, are launched from the <a href="/wiki/Kennedy_Space_Center" title="Kennedy Space Center">Kennedy Space Center</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cape_Canaveral" title="Cape Canaveral">Cape Canaveral</a> in <a href="/wiki/Florida" title="Florida">Florida</a>. Once in <a href="/wiki/Orbit" title="Orbit">orbit</a>, the shuttles dock with the new 11-year old modified Russian space station <a href="/wiki/Mir" title="Mir">Mir</a> manned by Lev Andropov (Stormare) to refuel. A fire breaks out during the transfer and the station is evacuated just before it explodes, with Lev and A. J. making a narrow escape. After 60 hours, the shuttles <a href="/wiki/Slingshot" title="Slingshot">slingshot</a> around the Moon at a maximum speed of 22.500 miles per hour in order to land on the backside of the asteroid. Traveling through the asteroid's debris field Independence's hull is punctured and crashes onto the rock and Oscar, Noonan, Air Force Colonel Davis, Air Force Captain Tucker and munitions specialist Lieutenant Halsey are killed during the crash. Grace, watching from NASA headquarters, is distraught by A.J.'s apparent death.
</p><p><i>Freedom</i> lands safely, but misses the target area, so the team must now drill through a 50 ft. thick crust of compressed iron ferrite rather than the planned softer stone, but still on the fault line parallel with the asteroids' course. When they fall significantly behind schedule and communications are about to fail after one and a half hour, the military initiates "Secondary Protocol"; to remote detonate the weapon on the asteroid's surface, which apparently will not have any effect. While Truman delays the military at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mission_Control" title="Mission Control">Mission Control</a>, Harry persuades the shuttle commander Colonel Willie Sharp to disarm the bomb so they can complete the drilling.
</p><p>Distracted by Rockhound, who is having a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mental_breakdown" title="Mental breakdown">mental breakdown</a>, the Freedom crew loses their Armadillo with Max in it when it strikes a methane gas pocket and is blown into space. Worldwide panic ensues as the mission is presumed lost and <a href="/wiki/Martial_law" title="Martial law">martial law</a> is declared to evacuate people to underground shelters, just as another meteorite destroys most of Paris. Suddenly, A.J., Lev, and Bear, having survived the Independence crash, arrive in the Independence's Armadillo in time to complete the drilling.
</p><p>As the asteroid approaches the Earth, it heats up, causing a dangerous rock storm that damages the bomb's remote trigger and kills munition specialist sergeant Gruber. They realize that someone must stay behind to detonate it manually. After all the non-flight crew volunteers, they draw straws, and A.J. is selected. As he and Harry exit the airlock, Harry rips off A.J.'s air hose and shoves him back inside, telling him that he is the son he never had and he would be proud to have him marry Grace. Harry prepares to detonate the bomb and contacts Grace to say his last goodbyes. After the Freedom moves to a safe distance, Harry pushes the button at the last minute (after some difficulty) and his life passes before his eyes as the asteroid is destroyed. It breaks in two and both halves fly past the Earth. Freedom lands, and the surviving crew are treated as heroes. The film ends with A.J. and Grace's wedding, complete with photos of Harry and the other lost crew members present in memoriam.

</p><p>Bio-chemical expert Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich sends a message to the <a href="/wiki/Impossible_Missions_Force" title="Impossible Missions Force">IMF</a> for <a href="/wiki/Ethan_Hunt" title="Ethan Hunt">Ethan Hunt</a>, an old friend of his, warning that his employer, Biocyte Pharmaceuticals, forced him to develop a biological epidemic to profit from its remedy. He arranges to meet with Ethan to deliver the <a href="/wiki/Chimera_(virus)" title="Chimera (virus)">Chimera</a> virus, and its cure, <a href="/wiki/Bellerophon" title="Bellerophon">Bellerophon</a>. With Ethan on vacation and incommunicado, the IMF sends agent Sean Ambrose disguised as Ethan to meet Nekhorvich on a passenger plane. Ambrose goes rogue, killing Nekhorvich and stealing Bellerophon before his men destroy the plane.
</p><p>IMF Commander Swanbeck informs Ethan of the circumstances of Nekhorvich's death and they determine Ambrose is responsible. Swanbeck tasks Ethan with recovering the virus and its cure, and has him recruit Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a professional thief presently operating in <a href="/wiki/Seville" title="Seville">Seville</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>. After recruiting Nyah and romancing her, Ethan finds out that she is Ambrose's ex-girlfriend and he reluctantly convinces her to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spy" title="Spy">spy</a> on Ambrose.
</p><p>Ethan assembles his team, computer expert Luther Stickell and pilot Billy Baird, in <a href="/wiki/Sydney" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, where Biocyte laboratories are located and Ambrose is staying. As Ethan stakes out Biocyte, Nyah rekindles her former relationship with Ambrose and relays information to Ethan's team. At a <a href="/wiki/Horse_racing" title="Horse racing">horse racing</a> event, Ambrose meets with Biocyte's CEO, John C. McCloy. He shows McCloy a memory card video of Chimera affecting one of Nekhorvich's colleagues before blackmailing McCloy into cooperating with him. Nyah steals the camera's memory card and delivers it to Ethan. They learn that Chimera has a 20-hour dormant period before it causes death by mass destruction of the victim's <a href="/wiki/Red_blood_cell" title="Red blood cell">red blood cells</a>. Bellerophon can only save the victim if used within that 20-hour window. When Nyah discreetly returns the memory card to Ambrose, he notices it is in the wrong pocket of his jacket.
</p><p>Ethan's team kidnaps McCloy to force him to give up Bellerophon. However, the only Bellerophon samples were taken by Nekhorvich, and are now in Ambrose's hands. Ambrose has the cure, but does not have the virus; unbeknownst to him at the time, Nekhorvich injected himself with Chimera to smuggle it out of Biocyte. Ambrose plans to exchange a sample of Bellerophon to McCloy for a sample of Chimera. Ethan's team breaks into Biocyte to destroy the virus before the exchange can take place. Ambrose, posing as Ethan, tricks Nyah into revealing the plan, then captures Nyah and raids Biocyte to secure the virus. Ethan is able to destroy all but one sample of Chimera before Ambrose intervenes, and a firefight ensues, culminating in the sample being dropped on the floor between Ambrose and Ethan. Ambrose orders Nyah to retrieve the sample; she instead injects herself with it, preventing Ambrose from simply killing her after she retrieved it for him. Nyah insists that Ethan kill her to destroy the virus but Ethan is unwilling to do so. Ambrose takes Nyah away as Ethan escapes from the laboratory.
</p><p>Ambrose releases Nyah to wander the streets of Sydney in a daze, intending to start a <a href="/wiki/Pandemic" title="Pandemic">pandemic</a>. He offers to sell Bellerophon to McCloy in exchange for stock options, to make him Biocyte's majority shareholder. He predicts that the price of Biocyte's stock will skyrocket due to demand for Bellerophon after the Chimera outbreak. Ethan infiltrates the meeting and steals the remaining samples of Bellerophon. While Ethan is pursued by Ambrose and his men, Luther and Billy locate Nyah, who has wandered to a cliff side, intent on killing herself to prevent the eventual outbreak. Ethan kills Ambrose's men but Ambrose chases him to a beach where Ethan defeats him in a brutal fistfight. With little time left on the 20-hour countdown, Luther reaches Ethan at the beach. As Ethan is about to give Luther the Bellerophon canister, Ambrose recovers and points a gun at Ethan. Ethan throws the canister to Luther and jumps away from Ambrose's shot while kicking up a gun from the sand which he uses to finally kill Ambrose. Luther injects Nyah with the Bellerophon in time to cure her.

They discover an already asleep Fluffy and face a series of safeguards including a deadly plant known as Devil's Snare, a room filled with aggressive flying keys that bruise Harry, and a dangerous life-sized game of <a href="/wiki/Chess" title="Chess">chess</a> that almost kills Ron.
</p><p>After getting past the tasks, Harry discovers that it was <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> teacher <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Quirinus Quirrell</a> who was trying to claim the stone: Snape had actually been protecting Harry all along. Quirrell removes his turban and reveals a weak Voldemort living on the back of his head. Through an enchantment placed by Dumbledore, Harry finds the stone in his possession. Voldemort attempts to bargain the stone from Harry in exchange for reviving his parents, but Harry refuses. Quirrell attempts to kill Harry in response; however, he is instead killed after Harry ends up burning his skin - reducing Quirrell to dust and causing Voldemort's to rise from his ashes. Harry is knocked unconscious in the process.
</p><p>Harry recovers in the school hospital with Dumbledore at his side. Dumbledore explains that the stone has been destroyed and that Ron and Hermione are safe. Dumbledore also reveals how Harry was able to defeat Quirrell: when Harry's mother died to save him, her death gave Harry a love-based protection against Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances - tying them for first place with Slytherin. Dumbledore then awards ten points to Neville for attempting to stop the trio, granting Gryffindor the House Cup. Harry returns home for the summer, happy to finally have a real home in Hogwarts.

After capturing him, a sympathetic Frodo decides to use Gollum as a guide to Mordor, despite Sam's objections. 
</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Aragorn" title="Aragorn">Aragorn</a>, <a href="/wiki/Legolas" title="Legolas">Legolas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Gimli_(Middle-earth)" title="Gimli (Middle-earth)">Gimli</a> pursue the <a href="/wiki/Uruk-hai" title="Uruk-hai">Uruk-hai</a> to save their companions <a href="/wiki/Meriadoc_Brandybuck" title="Meriadoc Brandybuck">Merry</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peregrin_Took" title="Peregrin Took">Pippin</a>. The Uruk-hai are ambushed by the Rohirrim, the exiled army of <a href="/wiki/Rohan_(Middle-earth)" title="Rohan (Middle-earth)">Rohan</a>, while the two <a href="/wiki/Hobbit" title="Hobbit">Hobbits</a> escape into <a href="/wiki/Fangorn" title="Fangorn">Fangorn</a> Forest and encounter the <a href="/wiki/Ent" title="Ent">Ent</a> <a href="/wiki/Treebeard" title="Treebeard">Treebeard</a>. Aragorn's group later meets the Rohirrim and their leader <a href="/wiki/%C3%89omer" title="Éomer">Éomer</a>, who reveals that their king <a href="/wiki/Th%C3%A9oden" title="Théoden">Théoden</a> is being manipulated by <a href="/wiki/Saruman" title="Saruman">Saruman</a>'s servant <a href="/wiki/Gr%C3%ADma_Wormtongue" title="Gríma Wormtongue">Gríma Wormtongue</a> into turning a blind eye to Saruman's forces running rampant in Rohan. While tracking down the Hobbits in Fangorn, Aragorn's group encounters <a href="/wiki/Gandalf" title="Gandalf">Gandalf</a>, who, after succumbing to his injuries while killing the Balrog in <a href="/wiki/Moria_(Middle-earth)" title="Moria (Middle-earth)">Moria</a>, has been resurrected as Gandalf the White to help save <a href="/wiki/Middle-earth" title="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a>.
</p><p>Aragorn's group travels to Rohan's capital city Edoras, where Gandalf releases Théoden from Saruman's influence and Wormtongue is banished. After learning about Saruman's plans to wipe out Rohan with his Uruk-hai army, Théoden decides to move his citizens to <a href="/wiki/Helm%27s_Deep" title="Helm's Deep">Helm's Deep</a>, an ancient fortress that has provided refuge to Rohan's people in times past, while Gandalf departs to acquire the aid of the Rohirrim. Aragorn builds a friendship with Théoden's niece, <a href="/wiki/%C3%89owyn" title="Éowyn">Éowyn</a>, who quickly becomes infatuated with him. When the exodus comes under attack by <a href="/wiki/Warg_(Middle-earth)" title="Warg (Middle-earth)">Warg</a>-riding Orcs, Aragorn falls off a cliff into a river and is presumed dead. However, he is found by his horse <a href="/wiki/List_of_Middle-earth_animals#Brego" title="List of Middle-earth animals">Brego</a> and taken to Helm's Deep. The Uruk-hai army arrives at Helm's Deep that night, finding a makeshift army of civilians and Elves from <a href="/wiki/Lothl%C3%B3rien" title="Lothlórien">Lothlórien</a> waiting for them as a night-long battle follows. Using gunpowder-like explosives on a sewer drain that Wormtongue told Saruman about, the Uruk-hai breach the outer wall and force the remaining defenders to retreat into the inner castle.
</p><p>At Fangorn, Merry and Pippin, having met Gandalf in the forest and convincing Treebeard they were allies, are brought to an Ent Council where the Ents decide not to assist in the war. Pippin then tells Treebeard to take them to a route passing <a href="/wiki/Isengard" title="Isengard">Isengard</a>, where they witness the devastation caused to the forest by Saruman's war efforts. An enraged Treebeard summons the Ents and they storm Isengard, drowning the orcs by breaking their river dam and stranding Saruman in Orthanc. 
</p><p>At Helm's Deep, Aragorn convinces a despairing Theoden to ride out and meet the Uruks in one last charge. Gandalf and the Rohirrim then arrive at sunrise, turning the tide of the battle and decimating the Uruk-hai while those remaining flee and are slaughtered. Despite this victory, Gandalf warns that Sauron's retaliation will be terrible and swift.
</p><p>Meanwhile, becoming loyal to Frodo after taking him and Sam through the <a href="/wiki/Dead_Marshes" title="Dead Marshes">Dead Marshes</a>, Gollum convinces the Hobbits of another entrance besides the <a href="/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth" title="Minor places in Middle-earth">Black Gate</a>. Frodo and Sam are later captured by the <a href="/wiki/Rangers_of_Ithilien" title="Rangers of Ithilien">Rangers of Ithilien</a> led by <a href="/wiki/Faramir" title="Faramir">Faramir</a>, brother of the late <a href="/wiki/Boromir" title="Boromir">Boromir</a>. After torturing Gollum while inadvertently instilling in him the notion that he has been betrayed when Frodo saves him from being killed, Faramir learns of the One Ring and takes his captives with him to <a href="/wiki/Gondor" title="Gondor">Gondor</a> to win his father's respect. While passing through the besieged Gondorian city of <a href="/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth" title="Minor places in Middle-earth">Osgiliath</a>, Sam reveals that Boromir's death was because he was driven mad by and tried to take the Ring. An attacking <a href="/wiki/Nazg%C3%BBl" title="Nazgûl">Nazgûl</a> nearly captures Frodo, who momentarily attacks Sam before coming to his senses, forcing Sam to remind him that they are fighting for the good still left in Middle-earth. Faramir is impressed by Frodo's rekindled hope and releases them along with Gollum. While leading the hobbits once more, Gollum decides to take revenge on Frodo and reclaim the ring by leading the group to "<a href="/wiki/Shelob" title="Shelob">Her</a>" upon arriving at <a href="/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth" title="Minor places in Middle-earth">Cirith Ungol</a>.
</p><p>Two <a href="/wiki/Hobbit" title="Hobbit">Hobbits</a>, Sméagol and <a href="/wiki/D%C3%A9agol" title="Déagol">Déagol</a>, are fishing when Déagol discovers the <a href="/wiki/One_Ring" title="One Ring">One Ring</a> in the river.

He retreats into the <a href="/wiki/Misty_Mountains" title="Misty Mountains">Misty Mountains</a> as the Ring twists his body and mind, until he becomes the creature <a href="/wiki/Gollum" title="Gollum">Gollum</a>.

Gandalf retrieves the defeated <a href="/wiki/Saruman" title="Saruman">Saruman</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Palant%C3%ADr" title="Palantír">palantír</a></i>. Pippin later looks into the seeing-stone, and is telepathically attacked by <a href="/wiki/Sauron" title="Sauron">Sauron</a>. Gandalf deduces that Sauron will attack <a href="/wiki/Gondor" title="Gondor">Gondor</a>'s capital <a href="/wiki/Minas_Tirith" title="Minas Tirith">Minas Tirith</a>. He rides there to warn Gondor's steward <a href="/wiki/Denethor" title="Denethor">Denethor</a>, taking Pippin with him.
</p><p>Gollum leads <a href="/wiki/Frodo_Baggins" title="Frodo Baggins">Frodo Baggins</a> and <a href="/wiki/Samwise_Gamgee" title="Samwise Gamgee">Samwise Gamgee</a> to <a href="/wiki/Minas_Morgul" title="Minas Morgul">Minas Morgul</a>. The hobbits begin climbing a stair carved in the cliff face that will take them into Mordor via a 'secret way' - unaware that Gollum plans to kill them and take the Ring. Sauron's army strikes and overwhelms <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Osgiliath" title="Osgiliath">Osgiliath</a>, forcing <a href="/wiki/Faramir" title="Faramir">Faramir</a> and his garrison to retreat to Minas Tirith.
</p><p>Gollum disposes of the Hobbits' food, blaming Sam. Frodo tells Sam to go home, before Frodo and Gollum continue to the tunnel leading to Mordor, where Gollum tricks him into venturing into the lair of the giant spider <a href="/wiki/Shelob" title="Shelob">Shelob</a>. Frodo narrowly escapes and confronts Gollum, telling him that he must destroy the Ring for both their sakes. Gollum attacks Frodo, but falls down a chasm. Frodo continues on, but Shelob discovers, paralyses and binds him. However, Sam arrives and drives her away. Sam hides as <a href="/wiki/Orc" title="Orc">Orcs</a> appear and take Frodo with them. Sam follows the Orcs into the Tower of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cirith_Ungol" title="Cirith Ungol">Cirith Ungol</a>, and frees Frodo so they can continue their journey.
</p><p>Aragorn learns from <a href="/wiki/Elrond" title="Elrond">Elrond</a> that <a href="/wiki/Arwen" title="Arwen">Arwen</a> is dying, having refused to leave Middle Earth after seeing a vision of <a href="/wiki/Eldarion" title="Eldarion">her son with Aragorn</a>.

Joined by Legolas and Gimli, Aragorn travels to the <a href="/wiki/Paths_of_the_Dead" title="Paths of the Dead">Paths of the Dead</a>, recruiting the Army of the Dead by pledging to release them from the curse Isildur put on them. Faramir is gravely wounded after a futile effort to retake Osgiliath; believing his son to be dead, Denethor falls into madness. Gandalf is left to defend the city against the Orc army, led by <a href="/wiki/Gothmog_(Third_Age)" title="Gothmog (Third Age)">Gothmog</a>. As Gothmog's army forces its way into the city, Denethor attempts to kill himself and Faramir on a <a href="/wiki/Pyre" title="Pyre">pyre</a>. Pippin alerts Gandalf and they save Faramir, but a burning Denethor leaps to his death from the top of Minas Tirith just before Théoden and his nephew, <a href="/wiki/%C3%89omer" title="Éomer">Éomer</a>, arrive with the Rohirrim. During the <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Pelennor_Fields" title="Battle of the Pelennor Fields">ensuing battle</a>, they are overwhelmed by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oliphaunt" title="Oliphaunt">Oliphaunt</a>-riding <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Haradrim" title="Haradrim">Haradrim</a>, while the <a href="/wiki/Witch-king_of_Angmar" title="Witch-king of Angmar">Witch-king of Angmar</a> mortally wounds Théoden. Though Théoden's niece <a href="/wiki/%C3%89owyn" title="Éowyn">Éowyn</a> destroys the Witch-King with Merry's help, Théoden dies of his wounds. Aragorn arrives with the Army of the Dead, who overcome the Orcs and win the battle; Aragorn then frees them from the curse. Aragorn decides to lead his army upon the Black Gate as a distraction, so Frodo and Sam can get to <a href="/wiki/Mount_Doom" title="Mount Doom">Mount Doom</a>.
</p><p>Aragorn's army <a href="/wiki/Battle_of_the_Morannon" title="Battle of the Morannon">draw out Sauron's forces</a> and empties Mordor, allowing Frodo and Sam to reach the volcano, but Gollum attacks them just as they reach Mount Doom. Frodo succumbs to the Ring and claims it as his own. Gollum attacks Frodo and bites his finger off to reclaim the Ring. Frodo fights back and knocks Gollum, who is holding the Ring, into the volcano, destroying the Ring and killing Gollum. As Frodo and Sam escape, Sauron is destroyed and Mordor crumbles. Gandalf flies in with <a href="/wiki/Eagle_(Middle-earth)" title="Eagle (Middle-earth)">eagles</a> to rescue the Hobbits, who awaken later in Minas Tirith and are reunited with the surviving Fellowship members. Aragorn is crowned King of Gondor and takes Arwen as his queen.

Shrek refuses to go at first, but Fiona talks him into it, and along with <a href="/wiki/Donkey_(Shrek)" title="Donkey (Shrek)">Donkey</a>, they travel to the kingdom of Far Far Away. They meet Fiona's parents, King Harold and Queen Lillian, who are shocked to see both their daughter and son-in-law are ogres, with Harold particularly repulsed. At dinner, Shrek and Harold get into a heated argument over how Shrek and Fiona will raise their family, and Fiona, disgusted at Shrek and Harold's behavior, locks herself away in her room that evening. Shrek worries that he has lost his true love, particularly after finding her childhood diary and reading that she was once infatuated with Prince Charming.
</p><p>Harold is reprimanded by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fairy_Godmother_(Shrek)" title="Fairy Godmother (Shrek)">Fairy Godmother</a> and her son Prince Charming by reminding him that Charming was to marry Fiona in exchange for his own happy ending. She implores him to find a way of getting rid of Shrek. Harold arranges for Shrek and Donkey to join him on a fictitious hunting trip, which is actually a trap to lure them into the hands of an assassin, <a href="/wiki/Puss_in_Boots_(Shrek)" title="Puss in Boots (Shrek)">Puss in Boots</a>. Unable to defeat Shrek, Puss reveals that he was paid by Harold and offers to come along and make amends. The three sneak into the Fairy Godmother's potion factory and steal a "Happily Ever After" potion that Shrek thinks will restore Fiona's love for him.
</p><p>Shrek and Donkey both drink the potion and fall into a deep sleep, awakening the next morning to discover its effects: Shrek is now a handsome man while Donkey has turned into an elegant white stallion. In order to make the change permanent, Shrek must kiss Fiona by midnight. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss return to the castle to discover that the potion has transformed Fiona back into her former human self as well. However, the Fairy Godmother, having discovered the potion's theft, intercepts Shrek and sends Charming to pose as him and win Fiona's love. At the Fairy Godmother's urging, Shrek leaves the castle, thinking that the best way to make Fiona happy is to let her go.
</p><p>To ensure that Fiona falls in love with Charming, the Fairy Godmother gives Harold a love potion to put into Fiona's tea. This exchange is overheard by Shrek, Donkey, and Puss, who are arrested by the royal guards and thrown into a dungeon. While the royal ball begins, several of Shrek's friends band together to free the trio with the help of The Muffin Man's monster-sized <a href="/wiki/Gingerbread_man" title="Gingerbread man">gingerbread man</a>, which breaks through the castle's defenses. Shrek is too late to prevent Charming from kissing Fiona, but instead of falling in love with Charming, Fiona knocks him out with a headbutt. Harold reveals that he never gave Fiona the love potion, whereupon the now-enraged Fairy Godmother attacks Shrek. In the ensuing melee, Harold sacrifices himself to save Shrek; his armor ricochets a spell cast by the Fairy Godmother which disintegrates her, and Harold is turned back into the <a href="/wiki/The_Frog_Prince" title="The Frog Prince">Frog Prince</a>, his true form. Harold gives his blessing to the marriage and apologizes for his earlier behavior, admitting his use of the Happily Ever After potion years earlier to gain Lillian's love, Lillian urges Harold that she loves him over his appearance.
</p><p>As the clock strikes midnight, Fiona rejects Shrek's offer to remain humans, and they happily let the potion's effects wear off and revert to their ogre forms, while Donkey changes back to his natural form as well. In the mid-credits scene, Dragon, who had previously romanced Donkey, reveals that they now have several dragon-donkey hybrid babies, much to his surprise.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_(character)" title="Harry Potter (character)">Harry</a> awakens from a nightmare wherein a man named <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Frank_Bryce" title="Frank Bryce">Frank Bryce</a> is killed after overhearing <a href="/wiki/Lord_Voldemort" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> conspiring with <a href="/wiki/Death_Eater#Peter_Pettigrew" title="Death Eater">Peter Pettigrew</a> and another man.

</p><p>At <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts" title="Hogwarts">Hogwarts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> introduces ex-<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Auror</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alastor_Moody" title="Alastor Moody">Alastor "Mad-Eye" Moody</a> as the new <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> teacher. He also announces that the school will host an event known as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Triwizard_Tournament" title="Triwizard Tournament">Triwizard Tournament</a>, in which three magical schools compete across three dangerous challenges. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Goblet_of_Fire" title="Goblet of Fire">Goblet of Fire</a> selects "champions" to take part in the competition: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric Diggory</a> of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hufflepuff" title="Hufflepuff">Hufflepuff</a> representing Hogwarts, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Viktor_Krum" title="Viktor Krum">Viktor Krum</a> representing the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Durmstrang_Institute" title="Durmstrang Institute">Durmstrang Institute</a> from Eastern Europe, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fleur_Delacour" title="Fleur Delacour">Fleur Delacour</a> representing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Beauxbatons_Academy_of_Magic" title="Beauxbatons Academy of Magic">Beauxbatons Academy of Magic</a> from <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>. The Goblet then unexpectedly selects Harry as a fourth champion. Dumbledore is unable to pull the underage Harry out of the tournament, as Ministry official <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Barty_Crouch_Sr." title="Barty Crouch Sr.">Barty Crouch Sr.</a> insists that the champions are bound by a contract after being selected.
</p><p>For the first task, each champion must retrieve a golden egg guarded by the dragon they pick. Harry succeeds in retrieving the egg, which contains information about the second challenge. Shortly after, a formal dance event known as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Yule_Ball" title="Yule Ball">Yule Ball</a> takes place; Harry and Ron attends with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parvati_Patil" title="Parvati Patil">Parvati</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Padma_Patil" title="Padma Patil">Padma Patil</a>, Harry's crush <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cho_Chang" title="Cho Chang">Cho Chang</a> attends with Cedric, and Hermione attends with Viktor, making Ron jealous. The second task involves the champions diving underwater to rescue their mates. Harry finishes third, but is promoted to second behind Cedric due to his "moral fibre", after saving Fleur's sister Gabrielle as well as Ron. Afterwards, Harry discovers the corpse of Crouch Sr. in the forest. Later, while waiting for Dumbledore in his office, Harry discovers a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pensieve" title="Pensieve">Pensieve</a>, which holds Dumbledore's memories. Harry witnesses a trial in which <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Igor_Karkaroff" title="Igor Karkaroff">Igor Karkaroff</a> confesses to the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic" title="Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> names of other Death Eaters after Voldemort's defeat. When he names <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> as one, Dumbledore vouches for Snape's innocence; Snape turned spy against Voldemort before the latter's downfall. After Karkaroff names Barty Crouch Jr., a devastated Crouch Sr. imprisons his son in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a>. Exiting the Pensieve, Harry realizes that Crouch Jr. is the man he saw in his dream.
</p><p>For the final task, the champions must reach the Triwizard Cup, located in a <a href="/wiki/Hedge_maze" title="Hedge maze">hedge maze</a>. After Fleur and Viktor are incapacitated, Harry and Cedric reach the cup together. The two claim a draw and together grab the cup, which turns out to be a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Portkey" title="Portkey">Portkey</a> and transports them to a graveyard where Pettigrew and Voldemort are waiting. Pettigrew kills Cedric with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Avada_Kedavra" title="Avada Kedavra">Killing Curse</a> and performs a ritual that rejuvenates Voldemort, who then summons the Death Eaters. Voldemort releases Harry and challenges him to a duel to prove he is the better wizard. A vulnerable Harry tries the Expelliarmus charm to block Voldemort's attempted Killing Curse. The beams from their wands entwine and Voldemort's wand disgorges the last spells it performed. The spirits of the people he murdered are seen in the graveyard, including Cedric, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lily_and_James_Potter" title="Lily and James Potter">Harry's parents</a>. This distracts Voldemort and his Death Eaters, allowing Harry to use the Portkey and escape with Cedric's body.
</p><p>Harry tells Dumbledore that Voldemort returned and killed Cedric. Moody takes Harry back to his office to interrogate him about Voldemort, but inadvertently blows his cover by asking Harry whether there were "others in the graveyard", despite Harry not mentioning a graveyard. Moody reveals that he submitted Harry's name to the Goblet of Fire and manipulated Harry throughout the tournament to ensure he would win. Moody attempts to attack Harry, but Dumbledore, Snape, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a> intervene and subdue him. The teachers force Moody to drink <a href="/wiki/Potions_in_Harry_Potter#Veritaserum" title="Potions in Harry Potter">Veritaserum</a>, and he reveals that the real Moody is imprisoned in a magical trunk as his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polyjuice_Potion" title="Polyjuice Potion">Polyjuice Potion</a> wears off. He is revealed as Crouch Jr. and returned to Azkaban.
</p><p>Dumbledore reveals to the students that Voldemort killed Cedric, although the Ministry of Magic opposes the revelation. Later, Dumbledore visits Harry in his dormitory, apologizing to him for the dangers he endured. Harry reveals that he saw his parents in the graveyard; Dumbledore names this effect as "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Priori_Incantatem" title="Priori Incantatem">Priori Incantatem</a>".

Shortly after, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_characters#Governor_Swann" title="List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters">Governor Swann</a> frees Elizabeth from jail, but he is then captured. Elizabeth bargains with Beckett to find the compass. Disguised as a cabin boy aboard a Scottish merchant vessel, she makes her way to Tortuga where she later finds Jack and also a drunken Norrington. After escaping the cannibals, Jack and the crew visit <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/voodoo" title="wikt:voodoo">voodoo</a> priestess <a href="/wiki/Tia_Dalma" title="Tia Dalma">Tia Dalma</a>, who reveals Jones' weakness is his heart, which is locked within the Dead Man's Chest. Jack must find it and the key that opens it. Locating the <i>Dutchman</i>, Will makes a deal with Jack to find the key to the chest in return for Jack's compass. Jack tricks Will, who is <a href="/wiki/Shanghaiing" title="Shanghaiing">shanghaied</a> into service aboard the <i>Dutchman</i>. Jones agrees to release Jack from their bargain in exchange for one hundred souls. Will meets his father aboard the <i>Dutchman</i> and learns that Jones possesses the key to the chest. They play a game of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Liar%27s_Dice" title="Liar's Dice">Liar's Dice</a> against Jones to try and win the key, but they lose. Despite this, Will escapes with the key and is taken aboard the same ship Elizabeth was on. Jones sends the Kraken after him, sinking the ship, but Will escapes.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/List_of_locations_in_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean#Tortuga" title="List of locations in Pirates of the Caribbean">Tortuga</a>, Jack hires a new crew, including Elizabeth and Norrington. With Elizabeth's use of Jack's compass, they are able to locate the chest. All parties arrive on <a href="/wiki/List_of_locations_in_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean#Isla_Cruces" title="List of locations in Pirates of the Caribbean">Isla Cruces</a>, where the chest is buried, but a three-way sword fight breaks out between Jack, Will, and Norrington, who all want the heart for their respective goals: Jack wants to call off the Kraken; Will wants to rescue his father; and Norrington wants to regain his life as a Navy officer. In the chaos, Norrington secretly steals the heart and runs off, pretending to lure away the <i>Dutchman</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s crew. Jones attacks the <i>Pearl</i> with the Kraken, which kills most of the crew and destroys all but one of the <i>Pearl</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s lifeboats, but Jack, who briefly flees the battle, returns and wounds the Kraken with a net full of gunpowder and rum.
</p><p>Jack orders the survivors to abandon ship, but Elizabeth, realizing the Kraken only wants Jack, tricks him and chains him to the mast so that the crew can escape. The Kraken drags Jack and the <i>Pearl</i> to Davy Jones' Locker. Jones opens the chest to discover his heart is gone. In Port Royal, Norrington gives Beckett the heart and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Letters_of_Marque" title="Letters of Marque">Letters of Marque</a> meant for Jack, allowing him back into the navy as well as allowing Beckett to gain control of Davy Jones and the seas. The <i>Pearl</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s crew take shelter with Tia Dalma, where they all agree to rescue Jack. Tia Dalma introduces the captain who will guide them: the resurrected <a href="/wiki/Hector_Barbossa" title="Hector Barbossa">Hector Barbossa</a>.

</p><p>The crew travels to the Locker and rescues Jack. The crew encounters many dead souls, including Elizabeth's father <a href="/wiki/Weatherby_Swann" title="Weatherby Swann">Governor Swann</a>, who was executed by Beckett. Tia Dalma reveals that the Goddess Calypso charged Davy Jones with the job to guide the souls of those who died at sea to the next world. Once every ten years he could come ashore to be with the woman he loved. But he corrupted his purpose and was cursed to become a monster. The soul of Governor Swann reveals that the <i>Dutchman</i> must always have a captain.
</p><p>Returning to the living world, the <i>Pearl</i> stops at an island for fresh water, where the crew find the <a href="/wiki/Kraken_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" title="Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)">Kraken</a> lying dead on the beach, having been killed by Jones under orders from Beckett.

Jack throws Will off the ship as part of the plan to seize control of the <i>Dutchman</i>. Sao Feng tells Elizabeth that the first Brethren Court bound Calypso in human form after she betrayed her lover, Davy Jones. He plans to release her to defeat Beckett. Davy Jones attacks Feng's ship, the <i>Empress</i>, mortally wounding Feng in the process. Feng appoints Elizabeth his successor as Pirate Lord before dying. Elizabeth and the crew are locked in the brig of the <i>Dutchman</i>, where she finds a partially insane Bootstrap Bill Turner. In a moment of clarity, Bootstrap reveals that whoever kills Davy Jones must take his place, bound to serve the <i>Dutchman</i> forever. He reiterates that "the <i>Dutchman</i> must always have a captain." <a href="/wiki/James_Norrington" title="James Norrington">Admiral Norrington</a> frees Elizabeth and her new crew from the <i>Dutchman</i>, but is killed by Bootstrap Bill.
</p><p>The <i>Black Pearl</i> arrives at Shipwreck Cove, where Barbossa attempts to persuade the Brethren Court to release Calypso. Davy Jones visits Tia Dalma in the <i>Pearl</i>'s brig, revealing she is Calypso. Jack's father <a href="/wiki/List_of_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_characters#Captain_Teague" title="List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters">Captain Teague</a>, Keeper of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pirate_Code" title="Pirate Code">Pirate Code</a>, informs the Court that only an elected Pirate King can decide on going into battle.

On board the <i>Dutchman</i>, Jones and Jack engage in a duel for control of Davy Jones' heart. Jones stabs Will, mortally wounding him. Jack gives up his chance for immortality and instead helps Will stab the heart, killing Jones, whose body falls into the maelstrom. Jack and Elizabeth escape the <i>Dutchman</i> as it is sucked into the maelstrom.
</p><p>As Beckett's ship, the <i>Endeavour</i>, approaches to destroy the <i>Pearl</i>, the <i>Dutchman</i> rises from the sea, now captained by Will; the crew has been freed from Jones' curse. Together, the two pirate ships destroy the <i>Endeavour</i>. A stunned Beckett goes down with his ship while his navy retreats.

The Joker interrupts the meeting to warn them that Batman is unhindered by the law, and offers to kill him in exchange for half of their money. The mob bosses disagree, and Gambol places a bounty on the Joker. The Joker finds and kills Gambol, taking over his gang. The mob decides to take the Joker up on his offer.
</p><p>Batman finds Lau in Hong Kong and brings him back to Gotham to testify, allowing Dent to apprehend the entire mob. The Joker threatens to kill people unless Batman reveals his identity, and starts by murdering Police Commissioner <a href="/wiki/Gillian_B._Loeb" title="Gillian B. Loeb">Gillian B. Loeb</a> and the judge presiding over the mob trial. The Joker also tries to kill Mayor Anthony Garcia, but Gordon sacrifices himself to stop the assassination. Dent kidnaps one of Joker’s henchmen and threatens him with a seemingly deadly game of heads or tails using Dent's lucky coin; in fact, Dent's coin has heads on both sides. Dent learns that Rachel is Joker's next target.
</p><p>Bruce decides to reveal his secret identity to prevent more deaths. Before he can, however, Dent falsely announces that <i>he</i> is Batman. Dent is taken into protective custody, but the Joker appears and attacks the convoy. Batman comes to Dent's rescue and Gordon, who faked his death, apprehends the Joker, securing a promotion to Commissioner. Rachel and Dent are escorted away by detectives on Maroni's payroll; Gordon later learns that they never arrived home. Batman interrogates the Joker, who reveals that they have been trapped in separate locations rigged with explosives and that Batman must choose one to save. Batman races to save Rachel, while Gordon attempts to rescue Dent. Batman arrives at the building, but realizes that the Joker has sent him to Dent's location instead. Both buildings explode, killing Rachel and disfiguring Dent. The Joker escapes with Lau, who leads him to the Mob's funds. The Joker burns the money and kills Lau and the Chechen.
</p><p>Coleman Reese, an accountant at <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Enterprises" title="Wayne Enterprises">Wayne Enterprises</a>, deduces that Bruce is Batman and threatens to publicize the information. Not wanting Reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the Joker threatens to destroy a hospital unless Reese is killed within an hour. All hospitals are evacuated and Gordon travels to secure Reese. The Joker, disguised as a hospital nurse, discovers Dent's ward and hands him a gun, convincing him to seek revenge for Rachel's death. The Joker destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. Dent goes on a killing spree, deciding the fates of people he holds responsible for Rachel's death by flipping his lucky coin, one face of which was corroded in the explosion. Dent eventually apprehends Gordon's family, believing Gordon's love for his family parallels his love for Rachel.
</p><p>After announcing that Gotham City will be subject to his rule by nightfall, the Joker rigs two evacuating ferries with explosives; one carrying civilians and the other prisoners. The passengers have been supplied with a trigger to the other boat's explosives, and the Joker announces through an intercom that he will blow both ferries if one of them has not been destroyed by midnight. Batman finds the Joker by using a sonar device that spies on the entire city, with the reluctant help of <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Fox" title="Lucius Fox">Lucius Fox</a>. The civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while Batman apprehends the Joker after a fight. Before the police arrive to take the Joker into custody, he gloats that Gotham's citizens will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes public knowledge.
</p><p>Gordon and Batman arrive at the building where Rachel died and find Dent threatening to kill Gordon's family. Dent again flips his coin and shoots Batman, spares himself, and aims to kill Gordon's son, claiming that Gordon's negligence is responsible for Rachel's death. Batman, who was wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the building to his death. Batman persuades Gordon to let him take responsibility for the killing spree to preserve Dent's heroic image. As the police launch a manhunt for Batman, Gordon destroys the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bat-signal" title="Bat-signal">Bat-signal</a>, Fox watches as the sonar device self-destructs, and <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred</a> burns a letter from Rachel saying she plans to marry Dent.

</p><p>To explore <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere" title="Pandoran biosphere">Pandora's biosphere</a>, scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called "avatars", operated by genetically matched humans; Jake Sully, a paraplegic former <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_Marine" title="United States Marine">Marine</a>, replaces his deceased identical twin brother as an operator of one. Dr. Grace Augustine, head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement but accepts his assignment as a bodyguard. While protecting the avatars of Grace and fellow scientist Dr. Norm Spellman as they collect biological data, Jake's avatar is attacked by a <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere#Fauna" title="Pandoran biosphere">thanator</a> and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Witnessing an auspicious sign, she takes him to her clan, whereupon Neytiri's mother Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Colonel" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's <a href="/wiki/Private_military_company" title="Private military company">private security force</a>, promises Jake that the company will restore his legs if he gathers information about the Na'vi and the clan's gathering place, a giant tree called Hometree,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Script25_36-0"><a href="#cite_note-Script25-36">[36]</a></sup> which stands above the richest deposit of unobtanium in the area. When Grace learns of this, she transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/outpost" title="wikt:outpost">outpost</a>. Over the following three months, Jake grows to sympathize with the natives. After Jake is initiated into the tribe, he and Neytiri choose each other as mates, and soon afterward, Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he attempts to disable a bulldozer that threatens to destroy a sacred Na'vi site. When Quaritch shows a video recording of Jake's attack on the bulldozer to Administrator Parker Selfridge,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Script8and15_37-0"><a href="#cite_note-Script8and15-37">[37]</a></sup> and another in which Jake admits that the Na'vi will never abandon Hometree, Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed.
</p><p>Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biological_neural_network" title="Biological neural network">biological neural network</a> native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate before commencing the attack. While trying to warn the Na'vi, Jake confesses to being a spy, and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Seeing this, Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, frees Jake, Grace, and Norm, and airlifts them to Grace's outpost, but during the escape Quaritch fires at them, hitting Grace.
</p><p>To regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fictional_universe_in_Avatar#The_Tree_of_Souls" title="Fictional universe in Avatar">Tree of Souls</a> and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can be completed. Supported by the new chief Tsu'tey, Jake speaks to unite the clan and tells them to gather all of the clans to battle against the RDA. Noticing the impending gathering, Quaritch organizes a <a href="/wiki/Preemptive_war" title="Preemptive war">pre-emptive strike</a> against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives. On the eve of battle, Jake prays to Eywa, via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na'vi.
</p><p>During the subsequent battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy; but are rescued when <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Characters_and_wildlife_in_Avatar#Fauna" title="Characters and wildlife in Avatar">Pandoran wildlife</a> unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch, wearing an <a href="/wiki/Mecha" title="Mecha">AMP suit</a>, escapes from his own damaged aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation.
</p><p>With the exceptions of Jake, Norm and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora and sent back to Earth, after which Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.

The despondent toys reflect on their future, and the army men leave by parachuting out the window. Andy intends to take Woody with him to college and puts the other toys in a trash bag to put them in the attic; however, Andy's mother thinks the bag is trash and mistakenly throws it out. The toys escape and climb into her car, as they are upset and believe Andy tossed them away, and get into a donation box with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Molly_(Toy_Story)" title="Molly (Toy Story)">Molly</a>'s old <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Barbie_(Toy_Story)" title="Barbie (Toy Story)">Barbie</a> doll, bound for Sunnyside Daycare.  Woody follows but is unable to convince them that Andy meant to keep them, and is forced to go along when Andy's mother drives off to donate them.
</p><p>Andy's toys are welcomed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lots-O%27-Huggin%27_Bear" title="Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear">Lots-O'-Huggin' Bear</a> ("Lotso") and the other toys at Sunnyside. Except Woody, Andy's toys are delighted to learn that Sunnyside never runs out of children to play with, and Barbie is enamored of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ken_(Toy_Story)" title="Ken (Toy Story)">Ken</a> doll there. Woody attempts to return home, but is instead found by Sunnyside student Bonnie, who brings him home and plays with him and her other toys, which are well-treated. Bonnie's clown toy <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chuckles_(Toy_Story)" title="Chuckles (Toy Story)">Chuckles</a> explains that he, Lotso, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Big_Baby_(Toy_Story)" title="Big Baby (Toy Story)">Big Baby</a> once had a beloved owner named Daisy, but were lost during a family trip. When they made it home, Lotso found he had been replaced. His personality changed; he lied to Big Baby, saying Daisy had replaced all of them. When they found Sunnyside, Lotso took over it, turning it into a toy prison, and Chuckles only escaped because Bonnie took him home for repair.
</p><p>At Sunnyside, Andy's toys dislike the toddlers' rough play. Buzz asks Lotso to move the toys to the older children's room, but Lotso switches Buzz to his original factory setting, erasing his memory. Mrs. Potato Head, through an eye she lost in Andy's room, sees Andy searching for them. They realize Woody was telling the truth about Andy's intentions and try to leave. Andy's toys are imprisoned by Lotso's henchmen who rely on "new recruits" to save themselves from the preschoolers' abuse.
</p><p>Woody returns to Sunnyside and learns from a <a href="/wiki/Chatter_Telephone" title="Chatter Telephone">Chatter Telephone</a> that the only way out is through the trash. Andy's toys accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Spanish Buzz promptly allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso's gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals Lotso's deception to Big Baby, who throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso's henchmen retreat and Lotso drags Woody into the dumpster as the truck collects the trash. The rest of the toys fall into the truck while trying to rescue him, except Barbie, Ken and Big Baby. A falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and personality. The truck brings the toys to a landfill, where the Aliens are swept away after spotting an industrial claw and the other toys are deposited on a conveyor belt that leads to an <a href="/wiki/Incineration" title="Incineration">incinerator</a>. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape. The toys resign themselves to their fate and prepare to die, but are rescued by the Aliens operating the claw. Lotso is found by a garbage truck driver, who ties him to his truck's radiator <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grille_(motor_vehicle)" title="Grille (motor vehicle)">grille</a> and drives away. Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.
</p><p>Woody leaves a note for Andy, who, thinking the note is from his mother, donates the toys to Bonnie. Andy introduces the toys individually to Bonnie, and to Andy's surprise, Woody is at the bottom of the donation box and Bonnie recognizes him. Though initially hesitant, Andy passes Woody on to Bonnie, and they play together before he leaves. Woody and the other toys witness Andy's departure as they begin their new lives with Bonnie.
</p><p>In the film’s epilogue, Barbie, Ken, and Big Baby have made vast improvements to Sunnyside and maintain contact with Bonnie's toys through letters. After parachuting in, the army men are welcomed to Sunnyside.

He retrieves it, but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons the trio, leaving them cornered by security. The three release the dragon guardian and flee on its back. Harry sees a vision of <a href="/wiki/Lord_Voldemort" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> killing goblins including Griphook, and learns Voldemort is aware of the theft. Harry also realises there is a Horcrux at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts" title="Hogwarts">Hogwarts</a> somehow connected to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rowena_Ravenclaw" title="Rowena Ravenclaw">Rowena Ravenclaw</a>.

</p><p><a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> hears of Harry's return and warns staff and students of punishment for aiding Harry. Harry confronts Snape, who flees after <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a> challenges him to a duel. McGonagall gathers the Hogwarts community for battle.

In the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a>, Hermione destroys the Horcrux cup with a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Basilisk_(Harry_Potter)" title="Basilisk (Harry Potter)">Basilisk</a> fang.

Goyle casts a Fiendfyre curse; unable to control it, he is burned to death while Harry and his friends save Malfoy and Zabini. Harry stabs the diadem with the Basilisk fang, and Ron kicks it into the Room of Requirement to be destroyed. As Voldemort's army attacks, Harry, seeing into Voldemort's mind, realises that Voldemort's snake <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nagini_(Harry_Potter)" title="Nagini (Harry Potter)">Nagini</a> is the final Horcrux. After entering the boathouse, the trio witness Voldemort telling Snape that the Elder Wand cannot serve Voldemort until Snape dies; he then orders Nagini to kill Snape. Before dying, Snape tells Harry to take his memories to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pensieve" title="Pensieve">Pensieve</a>.

</p><p>Harry learns from Snape's memories that while Snape despised Harry's late father <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/James_Potter_(character)" title="James Potter (character)">James</a>, who bullied him, he loved his late mother <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lily_Potter" title="Lily Potter">Lily</a>. Following her death, Snape worked with <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> to protect Harry from Voldemort due to his love for Lily. Harry also learns that Dumbledore was dying and wished for Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe he saw in the woods that led him to the sword was conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him; he must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within himself. Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort in the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts#Forbidden_Forest" title="Hogwarts">Forbidden Forest</a>. Voldemort casts the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Avada_Kedavra" title="Avada Kedavra">Killing Curse</a> upon Harry, who finds himself in <a href="/wiki/Limbo" title="Limbo">limbo</a>. Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's curse. Harry returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort.
</p><p>Voldemort announces Harry's apparent death to everyone at Hogwarts and demands their surrender. As Neville gives a defiant response and draws the sword from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sorting_Hat" title="Sorting Hat">Sorting Hat</a>, Harry reveals he is still alive; the Malfoys and many <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> abandon Voldemort. While Harry confronts Voldemort in a duel throughout the castle, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Molly_Weasley" title="Molly Weasley">Molly Weasley</a> kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall and Neville decapitates Nagini, making Voldemort mortal. Harry and Voldemort's fight ends with Voldemort's own Killing Curse rebounding and obliterating him. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that the Elder Wand recognised him as its true master after he disarmed Draco, who had earlier disarmed its previous owner, Dumbledore. Harry destroys the Elder Wand rather than claim it.
</p><p>Nineteen years later, Harry, <a href="/wiki/Ginny_Weasley" title="Ginny Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a>, Ron, Hermione, and Draco proudly watch their own children leave for Hogwarts at <a href="/wiki/London_King%27s_Cross_railway_station" title="London King's Cross railway station">King's Cross station</a>.
</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Asgard_(comics)" title="Asgard (comics)">Asgardian</a> <a href="/wiki/Loki_(comics)" title="Loki (comics)">Loki</a> encounters the Other, the leader of an extraterrestrial race known as the <a href="/wiki/Chitauri" title="Chitauri">Chitauri</a>. In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Tesseract_11-0"><a href="#cite_note-Tesseract-11">[N 2]</a></sup> a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. <a href="/wiki/Nick_Fury" title="Nick Fury">Nick Fury</a>, director of the espionage agency <a href="/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D." title="S.H.I.E.L.D.">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a>, and his lieutenant Agent <a href="/wiki/Maria_Hill" title="Maria Hill">Maria Hill</a> arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. <a href="/wiki/Erik_Selvig" title="Erik Selvig">Erik Selvig</a> is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent <a href="/wiki/Phil_Coulson" title="Phil Coulson">Phil Coulson</a> explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a <a href="/wiki/Wormhole" title="Wormhole">wormhole</a>, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a few other agents, including <a href="/wiki/Hawkeye_(comics)" title="Hawkeye (comics)">Clint Barton</a>, to aid him in his getaway.
</p><p>In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the "<a href="/wiki/Avengers_(comics)" title="Avengers (comics)">Avengers Initiative</a>". Agent <a href="/wiki/Black_Widow_(Natasha_Romanova)" title="Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)">Natasha Romanoff</a> is sent to <a href="/wiki/Kolkata" title="Kolkata">Calcutta</a> to recruit <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Banner_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)" title="Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)">Dr. Bruce Banner</a> to trace the Tesseract through its <a href="/wiki/Gamma_ray" title="Gamma ray">gamma radiation</a> emissions. Coulson visits <a href="/wiki/Tony_Stark_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)" title="Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)">Tony Stark</a> to have him review Selvig's research, and Fury approaches <a href="/wiki/Steve_Rogers_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)" title="Steve Rogers (Marvel Cinematic Universe)">Steve Rogers</a> with an assignment to retrieve the Tesseract.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Stuttgart" title="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>, Barton steals <a href="/wiki/Iridium" title="Iridium">iridium</a> needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., <a href="/wiki/Thor_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)" title="Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)">Thor</a>, his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the <a href="/wiki/Helicarrier" title="Helicarrier">Helicarrier</a>. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.
</p><p>The Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk falls to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above <a href="/wiki/Stark_Tower" title="Stark Tower">Stark Tower</a> to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.
</p><p>Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's location. Banner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians. The Hulk finds Loki and beats him into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at <a href="/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan" title="Midtown Manhattan">Midtown Manhattan</a>. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed.

</p><p>Princess <a href="/wiki/Elsa_(Frozen)" title="Elsa (Frozen)">Elsa</a> of Arendelle possesses paranormal powers that allows her to control and create ice and snow, often using it to play with her younger sister, <a href="/wiki/Anna_(Frozen)" title="Anna (Frozen)">Anna</a>. After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents, the King and Queen, take both siblings to a colony of trolls led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna, but alters her memories to remove traces of Elsa's magic, warning Elsa that she must learn to control her powers. He also states that fear will be Elsa's greatest enemy. The King and Queen isolate both sisters within the castle. Elsa shuts Anna out, causing a rift between them. Unable to control it, Elsa can only suppress her power, causing her to  become more insecure. When the sisters are teenagers, their parents die at sea during a storm.
</p><p>When Elsa turns 21, she is to be crowned queen of Arendelle. She is terrified that the kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear her. The castle gates open to the public and visiting dignitaries for the first time in years. Among them is the scheming Duke of Weselton and the dashing <a href="/wiki/Hans_(Frozen)" title="Hans (Frozen)">Prince Hans</a> of the Southern Isles, the latter of whom Anna falls in love with <a href="/wiki/Love_at_first_sight" title="Love at first sight">at first sight</a>. Elsa's <a href="/wiki/Coronation" title="Coronation">coronation</a> happens without a hitch, but she still remains distant from Anna. When Hans proposes to Anna, Elsa objects, accidentally unleashing her powers before the court; the Duke brands her a monster. Elsa flees to the North Mountain, where she builds a palace of ice in which to live a <a href="/wiki/Hermit" title="Hermit">hermit</a> life. In the process, however, her suppressed magic engulfs Arendelle in an eternal winter.
</p><p>Anna ventures out to find Elsa and end the winter, leaving Hans in command. She gets lost, collecting supplies at Wandering Oaken's shop. She meets an <a href="/wiki/Iceman_(occupation)" title="Iceman (occupation)">ice harvester</a> named <a href="/wiki/Kristoff_(Frozen)" title="Kristoff (Frozen)">Kristoff</a> and his <a href="/wiki/Reindeer" title="Reindeer">reindeer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sven_(Frozen)" title="Sven (Frozen)">Sven</a>, convincing them to take her to the mountains.

On foot, they meet <a href="/wiki/Olaf_(Frozen)" title="Olaf (Frozen)">Olaf</a>, a cheerful <a href="/wiki/Snowman" title="Snowman">snowman</a> brought to life unknowingly by Elsa, who offers to lead them to her. When Anna's horse returns to Arendelle, Hans sets out to find Anna and Elsa, accompanied by the Duke's minions, who have secret orders to kill Elsa.
</p><p>Reaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa, but when she reveals what has become of Arendelle, Elsa becomes upset, saying that she cannot undo it, and accidentally freezes Anna's heart, poisoning her. She then makes a giant snow monster named Marshmallow, who chases Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf away.  Realizing the effects of Elsa's spell on Anna, Kristoff takes her to the trolls, his adoptive family. Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless "an act of true love" reverses the spell. Kristoff races Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss. Hans and his men reach Elsa's palace, defeating Marshmallow and capturing Elsa. Anna is delivered to Hans but, rather than kissing her, Hans instead reveals that he has actually been plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters. Hans locks Anna in a room to die, and then manipulates the dignitaries into believing that Elsa killed her. He orders the queen's execution, only to discover she has escaped her detention cell.
</p><p>Olaf frees Anna, and they venture into the <a href="/wiki/Blizzard" title="Blizzard">blizzard</a> outside to meet Kristoff, whom Olaf reveals is in love with her. Hans confronts Elsa outside, claiming that she killed Anna, causing Elsa to break down. Anna spots Hans about to kill Elsa; she leaps in the way and freezes solid, stopping Hans. Devastated, Elsa hugs and mourns over her sister, who <a href="/wiki/Thaw_(weather)" title="Thaw (weather)">thaws</a> out, her heroism constituting "an act of true love". Realizing that love is the key to controlling her magic, Elsa ends the winter and gives Olaf his own snow flurry to survive the warmer climate. Both Hans and the Duke are arrested and exiled from the kingdom. Anna gives Kristoff a new sleigh, and the two kiss. Both sisters are reunited and Elsa promises never to lock the castle gates again.
</p><p>Sixty-five million years ago, an alien race known as the “Creators” used devices called Seeds to terraform Planet Earth, covering it with an alloy called Transformium. In the present day, <a href="/wiki/Geologist" title="Geologist">geologist</a> Darcy Tyril excavates the Transformium for K.S.I. Industries, which uses it to build man-made Transformer drones.
</p><p>Five years after <a href="/wiki/Transformers:_Dark_of_the_Moon" title="Transformers: Dark of the Moon">the Battle of Chicago</a>, humans have begun to view the Transformers as a threat, leading the U.S. government to terminate all human-Autobot joint programs. Although the public believes the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Autobots" title="Autobots">Autobots</a> have been granted sanctuary, they are being hunted by a rogue <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CIA" title="CIA">CIA</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Black_ops" title="Black ops">black ops</a> division known as Cemetery Wind, led by opportunistic government official Harold Attinger, who believes all Transformers should be exterminated regardless of their faction. They are aided by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lockdown_(Transformers)" title="Lockdown (Transformers)">Lockdown</a>, a Cybertronian <a href="/wiki/Bounty_hunter" title="Bounty hunter">bounty hunter</a> working for the Creators, promising to give Attinger a Seed if his division manages to capture <a href="/wiki/Optimus_Prime" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a>. Cemetery Wind locates <a href="/wiki/Ratchet_(Transformers)" title="Ratchet (Transformers)">Ratchet</a> in <a href="/wiki/Mexico_City" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a> and Lockdown kills him when he refuses to give up the whereabouts of Optimus Prime.
</p><p>Optimus, damaged in Mexico City and disguised as an old Marmon 97 semi-truck, is discovered in an abandoned theater by Cade Yeager, a financially struggling Texan inventor, and brings him back to his farm. While his teenage daughter Tessa and business partner Lucas Flannery encourage him to turn Optimus over to the authorities after realizing what he really is, Cade instead fixes Optimus, hoping to understand his technology and unexpectedly revives him. Still skeptical of Optimus, Lucas calls Cemetery Wind, who attacks and destroys the farm, but Optimus and Tessa's boyfriend, Irish <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rally_car" title="Rally car">rally car</a> driver Shane Dyson, come to the family's aid. While on the run from Cemetery Wind and Lockdown, Lucas is killed by one of Lockdown's grenades. Escaping into the desert, they take refuge in an abandoned gas station. Later, Optimus gains an alternate form after scanning a passing Western Star 5700 XE Phantom Custom truck with the original red and blue paint with flames and summons the surviving Autobots – <a href="/wiki/Bumblebee_(Transformers)" title="Bumblebee (Transformers)">Bumblebee</a>, who has assumed an alternate form (a 1967 Chevrolet Camaro), <a href="/wiki/Hound_(Transformers)" title="Hound (Transformers)">Hound</a>, <a href="/wiki/Drift_(Transformers)" title="Drift (Transformers)">Drift</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crosshairs_(Transformers)" title="Crosshairs (Transformers)">Crosshairs</a> – who have come to distrust humans due to Cemetery Wind constantly hunting them down. Using a CIA drone which he stole during the home invasion, Cade discovers K.S.I.'s involvement in the attacks on the Autobots. Optimus vows to personally kill Attinger for his actions against his brethren.
</p><p>Infiltrating K.S.I.'s headquarters in <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, Cade discovers the remains of Autobots and Decepticons are being melted down to make the drones. Joshua Joyce, the ambitious company CEO, is in league with Attinger to revolutionize global defenses and improve human society using the Seed. He has captured Brains and used him and data from <a href="/wiki/Megatron" title="Megatron">Megatron</a>'s head to create the drones and prototype Transformer soldiers <a href="/wiki/Galvatron" title="Galvatron">Galvatron</a> and Stinger. In a fit of rage, the Autobots storm the building, during which Bumblebee regains his original form by scanning a passing 2014 Chevrolet Camaro, where they rescue Brains and destroy the laboratory, but they soon leave after Joshua announces that they are no longer needed. Attinger forces Joshua to deploy Galvatron and Stinger to attack the Autobots. During the battle, Galvatron's behavior becomes slightly erratic when it starts destroying vehicles, and when it fights Optimus it speaks to him. Lockdown then arrives and abducts Optimus while Galvatron and Stinger retreat; Tessa is inadvertently captured alongside Optimus in the midst of the chaos, leaving Cade and Shane devastated.
</p><p>While Lockdown's large prison spacecraft hovers over Chicago to hand over the Seed, Cade, Shane, and the Autobots use the opportunity to sneak on board and rescue Optimus and Tessa, hijacking a smaller ship containing a group of Autobots called the <a href="/wiki/Dinobots" title="Dinobots">Dinobots</a>, just before Lockdown leaves Earth. The Autobots reveal to Cade that "Galvatron" is in fact Megatron, who gave K.S.I. the data to build the Transformer drones so he could transfer his consciousness into the Galvatron drone, after they had unknowingly revived him. What's more, Galvatron is plotting to use the Seed and the K.S.I. drones to conquer the world by detonating the Seed in <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, as K.S.I. has brought it there to use it in the remote Mongolian desert to create vast amounts of usable Transformium. Cade informs Joshua of Megatron's presence, causing him to have a change of heart and agreeing to hand over the Seed with help from Darcy and his Chinese business associate Su Yueming. Meanwhile, Lockdown discovers Optimus' escape with the Dinobots, and returns to Earth to retrieve them. Optimus decides for the Autobots to no longer help the humans because of how they revived Megatron, but Cade explains to Optimus why he shouldn't lose faith in them. At the K.S.I. facility, during a disagreement between Joshua and Attinger over the Seed, Galvatron reactivates himself and promptly takes control of the K.S.I. drones, and a battle follows in Hong Kong's streets between Cade's group, the Autobots, Cemetery Wind, Galvatron, and his drones. During the fight, Optimus gains the alliance of the Dinobots, who become essential to the Autobots' victory while Bumblebee kills Stinger.
</p><p>Lockdown returns to capture Optimus and the Dinobots, using a large <a href="/wiki/Magnet" title="Magnet">magnet</a> in his ship that picks up and drops metal objects, causing destruction to the city. After disabling the magnet, Optimus fights Lockdown at an abandoned factory. In the ensuing duel, Optimus kills Attinger (who still angrily deems all Cybertronians aside from Lockdown as a threat) to save Cade, and avenging the deaths of his fellow Autobots, but this allows Lockdown to pin Optimus down by impaling his chest with his own sword. Cade, Bumblebee, Tessa, and Shane fight Lockdown, with Cade ending up fighting him one-on-one while Tessa and Shane use a tow truck to free Optimus, who kills Lockdown by cutting him in half before using one of his grenades to finish off the remaining drones. Galvatron retreats, vowing to return.
</p><p>As Lockdown's ship leaves Earth, Optimus tells the Autobots to protect the Yeagers (with Joshua offering to help the Yeagers build a new home) and lets the Dinobots go, before flying away into space with the Seed to hide it away, sending a message to the Creators that <a href="/wiki/Transformers:_The_Last_Knight" title="Transformers: The Last Knight">he is coming for them</a>.

At a conference in <a href="/wiki/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> where the Accords are to be ratified, a bomb kills King <a href="/wiki/T%27Chaka" title="T'Chaka">T'Chaka</a> of Wakanda.

Rogers and Wilson track Barnes to <a href="/wiki/Bucharest" title="Bucharest">Bucharest</a> and attempt to protect him from T'Challa and the authorities, but all four, including T'Challa, are apprehended.
</p><p>Impersonating a psychiatrist sent to interview Barnes, Zemo recites the words to make Barnes obey him. He questions Barnes, then sends him on a rampage to cover his own escape. Rogers stops Barnes and sneaks him away. When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed "Winter Soldiers" are kept in <a href="/wiki/Suspended_animation" title="Suspended animation">cryogenic stasis</a>.

</p><p>Stark discovers evidence that Barnes was framed by Zemo and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes, unaware that they were secretly followed by T'Challa. They find that the other super-soldiers have been killed by Zemo, who then shows them footage that reveals that the automobile Barnes had intercepted in 1991 contained Stark's parents, whom Barnes subsequently killed.

After Kylo tells Rey what happened between him and Luke that caused him to choose the dark side, Luke confesses that he momentarily contemplated killing Kylo upon sensing that <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Leader_Snoke" title="Supreme Leader Snoke">Snoke</a> was corrupting him; this prompted Kylo to destroy Luke's new Jedi Order. Convinced that Kylo can be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To.

In a bargain for his freedom, DJ reveals the Resistance's plan to the First Order, and the evacuation transports are slowly destroyed.
</p><p>Ordered to kill Rey, Kylo instead kills Snoke and defeats his guards alongside Rey. Rey hopes that Kylo has returned to the light side, but he instead asks her to rule the galaxy with him. Refusing, she and Kylo each use the Force to try to take <a href="/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Anakin Skywalker</a>'s lightsaber, splitting it in two. Holdo sacrifices herself by ramming into Snoke's flagship at lightspeed, crippling it. Rey escapes in the chaos, while Kylo declares himself Supreme Leader.

Luke, exhausted, dies peacefully on Ahch-To, becoming one with the Force. Rey and Leia sense his death, and Leia tells her that the Resistance has all it needs to rise again.

He confronts Flora and tells her that he desires to get married. Frightened, she flees into the forest, pursued by Gus. Trapped on a precipice, Flora warns Gus she will jump if he comes any closer. When he does, she leaps to her death. Having run through the forest looking for her, Ben has seen her jump; he holds her as she dies, then carries her body back to the Cameron home. In response, the Klan hunts down Gus, tries him, finds him guilty, and <a href="/wiki/Lynching" title="Lynching">lynches</a> him.
</p><p>Lynch then orders a crackdown on the Klan after discovering Gus's murder. He also secures the passing of legislation allowing <a href="/wiki/Interracial_marriage" title="Interracial marriage">mixed-race marriages</a>. Dr. Cameron is arrested for possessing Ben's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan_regalia_and_insignia" title="Ku Klux Klan regalia and insignia">Klan regalia</a>, now considered a crime punishable by death. He is rescued by Phil Stoneman and a few of his black servants. Together with Margaret Cameron, they flee. When their wagon breaks down, they make their way through the woods to a small hut that is home to two sympathetic former Union soldiers who agree to hide them. An <a href="/wiki/Intertitle" title="Intertitle">intertitle</a> states, "The former enemies of North and South are united again in defense of their <a href="/wiki/Aryan" title="Aryan">Aryan</a> birthright."<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-22"><a href="#cite_note-22">[21]</a></sup>
</p><p>Congressman Stoneman leaves to avoid being connected with Lt. Gov. Lynch's crackdown. Elsie, learning of Dr. Cameron's arrest, goes to Lynch to plead for his release. Lynch, who had been lusting after Elsie, tries to force her to marry him, which causes her to faint. Stoneman returns, causing Elsie to be placed in another room.  At first Stoneman is happy when Lynch tells him he wants to marry a white woman, but he is then angered when Lynch tells him that it is Stoneman's daughter. Undercover Klansman spies go to get help when they discover Elsie's plight after she breaks a window and cries out for help. Elsie falls unconscious again, and revives while gagged and being bound. The Klan gathered together, with Ben leading them, ride in to gain control of the town. When news about Elsie reaches Ben, he and others go to her rescue. Elsie frees her mouth and screams for help. Lynch is captured. Victorious, the Klansmen celebrate in the streets. Meanwhile, Lynch's militia surrounds and attacks the hut where the Camerons are hiding. The Klansmen, with Ben at their head, race in to save them just in time. The next election day, blacks find a line of mounted and armed Klansmen just outside their homes, and are intimidated into not voting.
</p><p>The film concludes with a double wedding as Margaret Cameron marries Phil Stoneman and Elsie Stoneman marries Ben Cameron. The masses are shown oppressed by a giant warlike figure who gradually fades away. The scene shifts to another group finding peace under the image of <a href="/wiki/Jesus_in_Christianity" title="Jesus in Christianity">Jesus Christ</a>. The penultimate title is: "Dare we dream of a golden day when the bestial War shall rule no more. But instead — the gentle Prince in the Hall of Brotherly Love in the City of Peace."

</p><p>In 1938, Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman studying to become a nun at <a href="/wiki/Nonnberg_Abbey" title="Nonnberg Abbey">Nonnberg Abbey</a> in <a href="/wiki/Salzburg" title="Salzburg">Salzburg</a>. Her love of music and the mountains, her youthful enthusiasm and imagination, and her lack of discipline cause some concern among the nuns. The Mother Abbess, believing Maria would be happier outside the abbey, sends her to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children—Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. Liesl, the oldest, is won over after Maria protects her from discovery when she is nearly caught sneaking back into the house after meeting with Rolfe, a messenger boy she is in love with.
</p><p>While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children and takes them around Salzburg and the surrounding mountains, and teaches them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend, Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake that concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities, and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain orders her to return to the abbey. Just then he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. Afterwards, he apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay.
</p><p>Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes he enter them in the upcoming <a href="/wiki/Salzburg_Festival" title="Salzburg Festival">Salzburg Festival</a> but the suggestion is immediately rejected by the Captain as he is opposed to his children singing in public. He does agree, however, to organize a grand party at the villa. The night of the party, while guests in formal attire <a href="/wiki/Waltz" title="Waltz">waltz</a> in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional <i><a href="/wiki/L%C3%A4ndler" title="Ländler">Ländler</a></i> folk dance, he cuts in and dances with Maria in a graceful performance, culminating in a close embrace. Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy while convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. Back at the abbey, when Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her life. After Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. The Captain's feelings for Maria, however, have not changed, and after breaking off his engagement the Captain marries Maria.
</p><p>While the Captain and Maria are on their honeymoon, Max enters the children in the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes. When they learn that Austria has been annexed by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Third_Reich" title="Third Reich">Third Reich</a> in the <i><a href="/wiki/Anschluss" title="Anschluss">Anschluss</a></i>, the couple return to their home, where a telegram awaits informing the Captain that he must report to the German Naval base at <a href="/wiki/Bremerhaven" title="Bremerhaven">Bremerhaven</a> to accept a commission in the <a href="/wiki/Kriegsmarine" title="Kriegsmarine">German Navy</a>. Strongly opposed to the Nazis and the <i>Anschluss</i>, the Captain tells his family they must leave Austria immediately for <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>. Many of the Von Trapps' friends are prepared to accept the new regime, including Rolfe, whom Liesl is devastated to see has joined the <a href="/wiki/Hitler_Youth" title="Hitler Youth">Hitler Youth</a>. That night, as the von Trapp family attempt to leave, they are stopped by a group of <a href="/wiki/Sturmabteilung" title="Sturmabteilung">Brownshirts</a> waiting outside the villa. When questioned by <i><a href="/wiki/Gauleiter" title="Gauleiter">Gauleiter</a></i> Hans Zeller, the Captain maintains they are headed to the Salzburg Festival to perform. Zeller insists on escorting them to the festival, after which his men will accompany the Captain to Bremerhaven.
</p><p>Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slip away and seek shelter at the nearby abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Brownshirts soon arrive and search the abbey, and the family is discovered by Rolfe. Upon seeing Liesl, he hesitates raising the alarm long enough to allow the family time to flee, and the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When the soldiers attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start as two nuns have removed parts of the engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom.

Woltz refuses until he wakes up in bed with the severed head of his prized <a href="/wiki/Stud_(animal)" title="Stud (animal)">stallion</a>.
</p><p>Shortly before Christmas, drug baron Virgil "The Turk" Sollozzo, backed by the Tattaglia crime family, asks Vito for investment in his narcotics business and protection through his political connections. Wary of involvement in a dangerous new trade that risks alienating political insiders, Vito declines. Suspicious, Vito sends his enforcer, <a href="/wiki/Luca_Brasi" title="Luca Brasi">Luca Brasi</a>, to spy on them. Brasi is <a href="/wiki/Garrote" title="Garrote">garroted</a> during his first meeting with Bruno Tattaglia and Sollozzo. Later Sollozzo has Vito gunned down in the street, then kidnaps Hagen. With Corleone first-born <a href="/wiki/Sonny_Corleone" title="Sonny Corleone">Sonny</a> in command, Sollozzo pressures Hagen to persuade Sonny to accept Sollozzo's deal, then releases him. The family receives fish wrapped in Brasi's bullet-proof vest, indicating that Luca "sleeps with the fishes."

Michael plots to murder Sollozzo and McCluskey: on the deception of settling the dispute, Michael meets them in a <a href="/wiki/The_Bronx" title="The Bronx">Bronx</a> restaurant. There, retrieving a planted handgun, he kills both men.
</p><p>Despite a clampdown by the authorities, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Five_Families_(The_Godfather)" title="Five Families (The Godfather)">Five Families</a> erupt in open warfare and Vito fears for his sons' safety.

</p><p>Devastated by Sonny's death and realizing that the Tattaglias are controlled by the now-dominant Don <a href="/wiki/Emilio_Barzini" title="Emilio Barzini">Emilio Barzini</a>, Vito attempts to end the feud. He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder. His safety guaranteed, Michael returns home to enter the family business and marry Kay, promising her that the business will be legitimate within five years. Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s, and with his father at the end of his career and his brother too weak, Michael takes the family reins. He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Tom is not a "wartime consigliere"; Vito agrees Tom should "have no part in what will happen" in the coming battles with rival families. Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos. Michael is dismayed to see that Fredo has fallen under Greene's sway.

At the funeral, <a href="/wiki/Salvatore_Tessio" title="Salvatore Tessio">Tessio</a>, a Corleone <a href="/wiki/Caporegime" title="Caporegime">capo</a>, asks Michael to meet with Don Barzini, signalling the betrayal that Vito had forewarned. The meeting is set for the same day as the baptism of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone assassins murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is executed for his treachery and Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini. A Corleone capo, <a href="/wiki/Peter_Clemenza" title="Peter Clemenza">Clemenza</a>, garrotes Carlo with a wire.

</p><p>During a beach party at dusk on Amity Island, <a href="/wiki/New_England" title="New England">New England</a>, a young woman, Chrissie Watkins, goes <a href="/wiki/Nude_swimming" title="Nude swimming">skinny dipping</a> in the ocean. While <a href="/wiki/Treading_water" title="Treading water">treading water</a>, she is violently pulled under. The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner's ruling that the death was due to a <a href="/wiki/Shark_attack" title="Shark attack">shark attack</a> leads police chief Martin Brody to close the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly thereafter. A bounty is placed on the shark, prompting an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, and confirms her death was caused by a shark—an unusually large one.
</p><p>When local fishermen catch a <a href="/wiki/Tiger_shark" title="Tiger shark">tiger shark</a>, the mayor proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes that it is the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable <a href="/wiki/Great_white_shark" title="Great white shark">great white shark</a>'s tooth embedded in the submerged hull. He drops it in fright after encountering a partial corpse. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's statements that a huge great white shark is responsible for the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank in which the presence of a shark is simulated, the real shark enters a nearby <a href="/wiki/Estuary" title="Estuary">estuary</a>, killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces Vaughn to hire Quint.
</p><p>Quint, Brody, and Hooper set out on Quint's boat, the <i>Orca</i>, to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a <a href="/wiki/Chumming" title="Chumming">chum</a> line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating its length at 25 feet (7.6 m) and weight at 3 tonnes (3.0 long tons; 3.3 short tons), harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.
</p><p>At nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars and Quint reveals that he survived the <a href="/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)" title="USS Indianapolis (CA-35)">USS <i>Indianapolis</i></a>. The shark returns unexpectedly, ramming the boat's hull, and disabling the power. The men work through the night, repairing the engine. In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he intentionally pushes the damaged engine past the safety limits and the overtaxed engine fails.
</p><p>With the <i>Orca</i> slowly sinking, the trio attempt a riskier approach. Hooper puts on <a href="/wiki/Scuba_set" title="Scuba set">scuba gear</a> and enters the water in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shark-proof_cage" title="Shark-proof cage">shark-proof cage</a>, intending to lethally inject the shark with <a href="/wiki/Strychnine" title="Strychnine">strychnine</a>, using a hypodermic spear. The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly and devours Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody jams a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion obliterates the shark. Hooper surfaces, and he and Brody paddle back to Amity Island clinging to the remaining barrels.

</p><p>A group of alien botanists secretly visit <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a> under cover of night to gather plant specimens in a California forest. When government agents appear on the scene, the aliens flee in their spaceship, but in their haste, one of them is left behind. In a suburban neighborhood in the <a href="/wiki/San_Fernando_Valley" title="San Fernando Valley">San Fernando Valley</a>, a ten-year-old boy named Elliott is spending time with his brother, Michael, and his friends. As he returns from picking up a pizza, he discovers that something is hiding in their tool shed. The alien promptly flees upon being discovered. Despite his family's disbelief, Elliott leaves <a href="/wiki/Reese%27s_Pieces" title="Reese's Pieces">Reese's Pieces</a> candy to lure the alien to his house. Before going to sleep, Elliott realizes it is imitating his movements. He feigns illness the next morning to stay home from school and play with it. Later that day, Michael and their five-year-old sister, Gertie, meet it. They decide to keep it hidden from their mother, Mary. When they ask it about its origin, it levitates several balls to represent its <a href="/wiki/Planetary_system" title="Planetary system">planetary system</a> and then demonstrates its powers by reviving dead <a href="/wiki/Chrysanthemum" title="Chrysanthemum">chrysanthemums</a>.
</p><p>At school the next day, Elliott begins to experience a psychic connection with the alien, including exhibiting signs of intoxication (because it is at his home, drinking beer and watching <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tom_%26_Jerry" title="Tom &amp; Jerry">Tom &amp; Jerry</a></i>), and he begins freeing all the frogs in his biology class.

That night, Elliott and E.T. head through the forest, where they make a successful call home. The next day, Elliott wakes up in the field, only to find E.T. gone. Elliott returns home to his distressed family. Michael searches for and finds E.T. dying next to a culvert. Michael takes E.T. home to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son's illness and the dying alien, just as government agents invade the house. Scientists set up a hospital at the house, questioning Michael, Mary and Gertie while treating Elliott and E.T. Their connection disappears and E.T. then appears to die while Elliott recovers. A grief-stricken Elliott is left alone with the motionless E.T. when he notices a dead chrysanthemum, the plant E.T. had previously revived, coming back to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael's friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bicycles. Suddenly facing a police roadblock, they escape as E.T. uses <a href="/wiki/Psychokinesis" title="Psychokinesis">telekinesis</a> to lift them into the air and toward the forest, like he had done for Elliott before.

Before boarding the spaceship, he embraces Elliott and tells him "I'll be right here", pointing his glowing finger to Elliott's forehead. He then picks up the chrysanthemum, boards the spaceship, and it takes off, leaving a rainbow in the sky as everyone watches it leave.
</p><p>Industrialist John Hammond and his <a href="/wiki/Biological_engineering" title="Biological engineering">bioengineering</a> company, InGen, have created a <a href="/wiki/Animal_theme_park" title="Animal theme park">theme park</a> featuring cloned dinosaurs and prehistoric plants, called Jurassic Park, on <a href="/wiki/Isla_Nublar" title="Isla Nublar">Isla Nublar</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rican</a> island. After a dinosaur handler is killed by a <i><a href="/wiki/Velociraptor" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a></i>, the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro, demand that experts visit the park and certify it is safe. To perform the inspection, Gennaro invites <a href="/wiki/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chaos_theory" title="Chaos theory">chaos theorist</a> Ian Malcolm, while Hammond invites <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paleontologist" title="Paleontologist">paleontologist</a> Dr. Alan Grant and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paleobotanist" title="Paleobotanist">paleobotanist</a> Dr. Ellie Sattler. Upon arrival, the group is shocked to see a live <i><a href="/wiki/Brachiosaurus" title="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a></i>, in addition to two more with a herd of <i><a href="/wiki/Parasaurolophus" title="Parasaurolophus">Parasaurolophus</a></i>.
</p><p>At the park's visitor center, the group learns the cloning was accomplished by extracting <a href="/wiki/Ancient_DNA" title="Ancient DNA">dinosaur DNA</a> from <a href="/wiki/Mosquito" title="Mosquito">mosquitoes</a> preserved in <a href="/wiki/Amber" title="Amber">amber</a>. DNA from <a href="/wiki/Frog" title="Frog">frogs</a> was used to fill in gaps in the dinosaurs' <a href="/wiki/Genome" title="Genome">genome</a>. To prevent breeding, all the dinosaurs were made female. Malcolm scoffs at the idea, saying it will inevitably break down. The group witnesses the hatching of a baby <i><a href="/wiki/Velociraptor" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a></i> and visits the raptor enclosure. At lunch, the group debates the <a href="/wiki/Ethics_of_cloning" title="Ethics of cloning">ethics of cloning</a> and the creation of the park. Malcolm gives a harsh warning about the implications of <a href="/wiki/Genetic_engineering" title="Genetic engineering">genetic engineering</a>.
</p><p>The group is joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Tim and Lex, for a tour of the park, while Hammond oversees the tour from the park's control room. The tour does not go as planned. Most of the dinosaurs fail to appear and the group encounters a sick <i><a href="/wiki/Triceratops" title="Triceratops">Triceratops</a></i>. It is cut short as a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" title="Tropical cyclone">tropical storm</a> approaches Isla Nublar. Most park employees leave for the mainland on a boat, while the visitors return to their electric tour vehicles. Sattler stays behind with the park's veterinarian to study the <i>Triceratops</i>.
</p><p>Jurassic Park's lead computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, has been bribed by Dodgson, a man working for Hammond's corporate rival, to steal fertilized dinosaur <a href="/wiki/Embryo" title="Embryo">embryos</a>. Nedry deactivates the park's security system to gain access to the embryo storage room and puts the stolen embryos inside a canister disguised as a <a href="/wiki/Barbasol" title="Barbasol">Barbasol</a> shaving-cream can. The power goes out, stalling the tour vehicles. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated, allowing the <i><a href="/wiki/Tyrannosaurus" title="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></i> to escape and attack the group. Grant and Hammond's grandchildren survive. The <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro. While taking the embryos to the island's dock, Nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes his <a href="/wiki/Jeep_Wrangler" title="Jeep Wrangler">Jeep Wrangler</a>, and is killed by a <i><a href="/wiki/Dilophosaurus" title="Dilophosaurus">Dilophosaurus</a></i>.
</p><p>Sattler helps the park's game warden, Robert Muldoon, search for survivors. They find only Malcolm before the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> returns. Grant, Tim, and Lex take shelter in a treetop. They later discover broken dinosaur egg shells. Grant concludes the dinosaurs have been breeding. This occurred because their West African frog DNA—<a href="/wiki/Common_reed_frog" title="Common reed frog">Common reed frog</a> can change their sex in a single-sex environment, allowing the dinosaurs to do so as well, proving Malcolm right.
</p><p>Unable to decipher Nedry's code to reactivate the security system, Hammond and the park's chief engineer Ray Arnold reboot the park's system. The group shuts down the park's grid and retreats to an emergency bunker, while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When Arnold fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head to the shed. They discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining fences and released the <i>Velociraptors</i>. Muldoon distracts the raptors, while Sattler goes to turn the power back on. As she is turning the power on, Grant, Lex and Tim are climbing the perimeter fence. Grant and Lex make it down in time but Tim is electrocuted. Grant gives Tim <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CPR" title="CPR">CPR</a> and he survives. Sattler is attacked by a raptor and discovers Arnold's severed arm. Muldoon is caught off guard and killed by the other two raptors.
</p><p>After encountering a <i><a href="/wiki/Brachiosaurus" title="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a></i> and narrowly escaping the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> during a <i><a href="/wiki/Gallimimus" title="Gallimimus">Gallimimus</a></i> stampede, Grant, Tim, and Lex reach the visitor center. Grant heads out to look for Sattler, leaving Tim and Lex inside. They are pursued by the raptors in an industrial kitchen but escape and join Grant and Sattler. Lex restores full power from the control room, allowing them to call Hammond, who in turn calls for help. Grant, Tim, Lex, and Sattler are cornered by the raptors, but they escape when the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> suddenly appears and kills the raptors. Hammond arrives in a jeep with Malcolm, and the survivors board a helicopter to leave the island.

They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[Note 1]</a></sup> Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard <i>Keldysh</i> and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard <i>Titanic</i>.
</p><p>In 1912 <a href="/wiki/Southampton" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>, 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fiancé Cal Hockley, and her mother Ruth board the luxurious <i>Titanic</i>. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve their family's financial problems and retain their high-class persona. Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class.
</p><p>Aware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cal's bodyguard, Mr. Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with an iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.
</p><p>Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Lovejoy slips the necklace into Jack's pocket and he and Cal accuse him of theft. Jack is arrested, taken to the <a href="/wiki/Master-at-arms" title="Master-at-arms">master-at-arms</a>' office, and handcuffed to a pipe. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.
</p><p>With the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.
</p><p>After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for only one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of <a href="/wiki/Hypothermia" title="Hypothermia">hypothermia</a><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Carlson_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Carlson-9">[8]</a></sup> but Rose is saved.
</p><p>With Rose hiding from Cal en route, the <a href="/wiki/RMS_Carpathia" title="RMS Carpathia">RMS <i>Carpathia</i></a> takes the survivors to New York City where Rose gives her name as Rose Dawson.

</p><p>Back in the present, Lovett decides to abandon his search after hearing Rose's story.

</p><p>To explore <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere" title="Pandoran biosphere">Pandora's biosphere</a>, scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called "avatars", operated by genetically matched humans; Jake Sully, a paraplegic former <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_Marine" title="United States Marine">Marine</a>, replaces his deceased identical twin brother as an operator of one. Dr. Grace Augustine, head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement but accepts his assignment as a bodyguard. While protecting the avatars of Grace and fellow scientist Dr. Norm Spellman as they collect biological data, Jake's avatar is attacked by a <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere#Fauna" title="Pandoran biosphere">thanator</a> and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Witnessing an auspicious sign, she takes him to her clan, whereupon Neytiri's mother Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Colonel" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's <a href="/wiki/Private_military_company" title="Private military company">private security force</a>, promises Jake that the company will restore his legs if he gathers information about the Na'vi and the clan's gathering place, a giant tree called Hometree,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Script25_36-0"><a href="#cite_note-Script25-36">[36]</a></sup> which stands above the richest deposit of unobtanium in the area. When Grace learns of this, she transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/outpost" title="wikt:outpost">outpost</a>. Over the following three months, Jake grows to sympathize with the natives. After Jake is initiated into the tribe, he and Neytiri choose each other as mates, and soon afterward, Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he attempts to disable a bulldozer that threatens to destroy a sacred Na'vi site. When Quaritch shows a video recording of Jake's attack on the bulldozer to Administrator Parker Selfridge,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Script8and15_37-0"><a href="#cite_note-Script8and15-37">[37]</a></sup> and another in which Jake admits that the Na'vi will never abandon Hometree, Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed.
</p><p>Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biological_neural_network" title="Biological neural network">biological neural network</a> native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate before commencing the attack. While trying to warn the Na'vi, Jake confesses to being a spy, and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Seeing this, Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, frees Jake, Grace, and Norm, and airlifts them to Grace's outpost, but during the escape Quaritch fires at them, hitting Grace.
</p><p>To regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fictional_universe_in_Avatar#The_Tree_of_Souls" title="Fictional universe in Avatar">Tree of Souls</a> and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can be completed. Supported by the new chief Tsu'tey, Jake speaks to unite the clan and tells them to gather all of the clans to battle against the RDA. Noticing the impending gathering, Quaritch organizes a <a href="/wiki/Preemptive_war" title="Preemptive war">pre-emptive strike</a> against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives. On the eve of battle, Jake prays to Eywa, via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na'vi.
</p><p>During the subsequent battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy; but are rescued when <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Characters_and_wildlife_in_Avatar#Fauna" title="Characters and wildlife in Avatar">Pandoran wildlife</a> unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch, wearing an <a href="/wiki/Mecha" title="Mecha">AMP suit</a>, escapes from his own damaged aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation.

He unites all but the Jabari Tribe to form the nation of <a href="/wiki/Wakanda" title="Wakanda">Wakanda</a>. Over centuries, the Wakandans use the vibranium to develop advanced technology and isolate themselves from the world by posing as a <a href="/wiki/Third_World" title="Third World">Third World</a> country.

Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue as Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him.
</p><p>While Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, the latter attacked Zuri and forced T'Chaka to kill him. T'Chaka ordered Zuri to lie that N'Jobu had disappeared and left behind N'Jobu's American son in order to maintain the lie. This boy grew up to be Stevens, a U.S. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Black_ops" title="Black ops">black ops</a> soldier who adopted the name "Killmonger". Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity to be N'Jadaka and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat, where he kills Zuri, defeats T'Challa, and hurls him over a waterfall to his presumed death. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first. Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.

Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit. W'Kabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down planes carrying the vibranium weapons. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated.

</p><p>Impersonating a psychiatrist sent to interview Barnes, Zemo recites the words to make Barnes obey him. He questions Barnes, then sends him on a rampage to cover his own escape. Rogers stops Barnes and sneaks him away. When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed "Winter Soldiers" are kept in <a href="/wiki/Suspended_animation" title="Suspended animation">cryogenic stasis</a>.

The rest of Rogers' team is captured and detained at the Raft prison, while Rhodes is partially paralyzed after being inadvertently shot down by Vision, and Romanoff goes into exile.
</p><p>Stark discovers evidence that Barnes was framed by Zemo and convinces Wilson to give him Rogers' destination. Without informing Ross, Stark goes to the Siberian Hydra facility and strikes a truce with Rogers and Barnes, unaware that they were secretly followed by T'Challa. They find that the other super-soldiers have been killed by Zemo, who then shows them footage that reveals that the automobile Barnes had intercepted in 1991 contained Stark's parents, whom Barnes subsequently killed. Enraged that Rogers kept this from him, Stark turns on them both, leading to an intense fight, in which Stark destroys Barnes' robotic arm, and Rogers disables <a href="/wiki/Iron_Man%27s_armor_in_other_media#Live_action" title="Iron Man's armor in other media">Stark's armor</a>.

Talos, arriving unarmed, explains that the Skrulls are refugees searching for a new home and that Lawson was Mar-Vell, a renegade Kree scientist helping them. Talos plays a recovered recording from Lawson's jet, prompting Danvers to remember the crash: Lawson was killed by Yon-Rogg to prevent her from destroying the engine before the Kree could recover it. Destroying the engine herself, Danvers absorbed the energy from the ensuing explosion, gaining powers but losing her memory.
</p><p>Danvers, Talos, Fury, and Rambeau locate Lawson's cloaked laboratory orbiting Earth, where Lawson hid several Skrulls, including Talos's family, and the <a href="/wiki/Cosmic_Cube" title="Cosmic Cube">Tesseract</a>, the power source of Lawson’s engine. There, Danvers is captured by Starforce and interfaces with the Supreme Intelligence. During their conversation, Danvers removes the Kree implant that was suppressing her powers, allowing her to reach her full potential. In the subsequent battle, Fury retrieves Goose, who is revealed to be an alien <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flerken" title="Flerken">Flerken</a>.

When a tracking device on Schultz leads to Maryland, Parker rejoins the decathlon team and accompanies them to Washington, D.C. for their national tournament. Ned and Parker disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit, and unlock its advanced features. Parker tries to stop Toomes from stealing weapons from a D.O.D.C. truck, but is trapped inside the truck, causing him to miss the decathlon tournament. When he discovers that the power core is an unstable Chitauri grenade, Parker races to the <a href="/wiki/Washington_Monument" title="Washington Monument">Washington Monument</a> where the core explodes and traps Ned and their friends in an elevator.

Thor, Banner, and 142 escape through a wormhole to Asgard, where Hela's forces are attacking Heimdall and the remaining Asgardians in pursuit of the sword that controls the Bifröst. Banner transforms into Hulk again, defeating Fenris, while Thor and 142 fight Hela and her warriors. Loki and the gladiators arrive to rescue the citizens, and a repentant Skurge sacrifices himself to enable their escape. Thor, facing Hela, loses his right eye and then has a vision of Odin that helps him realize only Ragnarök can stop her. He sends Loki to retrieve Surtur's crown and place it in the Eternal Flame.

Strange learns about Jonathan Pangborn, a <a href="/wiki/Paraplegia" title="Paraplegia">paraplegic</a> who mysteriously regained use of his legs. Pangborn directs Strange to Kamar-Taj, where he is taken in by <a href="/wiki/Baron_Mordo" title="Baron Mordo">Mordo</a>, a sorcerer under the Ancient One.

The sorcerers' task is to protect the Sanctums, though Pangborn instead chose to channel mystical energy only into walking again.

They believe Pym's wife <a href="/wiki/Wasp_(comics)" title="Wasp (comics)">Janet van Dyne</a> might be trapped there after shrinking to sub-atomic levels in 1987. When he had previously visited the quantum realm, Lang had unknowingly become <a href="/wiki/Quantum_entanglement" title="Quantum entanglement">quantumly entangled</a> with Janet, and now he receives an apparent message from her.
</p><p>With only days left of house arrest, Lang contacts Pym about Janet despite the strained relationship they have due to Lang's actions with the Avengers. Hope and Pym kidnap Lang, leaving a decoy so as not to arouse suspicion from FBI agent <a href="/wiki/Jimmy_Woo" title="Jimmy Woo">Jimmy Woo</a>. Believing the message from Janet to be confirmation that she is alive, the trio work to build a stable quantum tunnel so they can take a vehicle to the quantum realm and retrieve her.

Lang and Hope distract Ava while Pym enters the quantum realm to retrieve Janet, but Burch and his men also attack Lang and Hope which allows Ava to begin forcibly taking Janet's energy.

Stark escapes in an experimental new Iron Man suit, which his <a href="/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> <a href="/wiki/Edwin_Jarvis" title="Edwin Jarvis">J.A.R.V.I.S.</a> pilots to rural Tennessee, following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's new armor is not fully functional, and lacks sufficient power to return to California, leaving the world to believe him dead.
</p><p>Teaming with Harley, a 10-year-old boy, Stark investigates the remains of a local explosion bearing the hallmarks of a Mandarin attack. He discovers the "bombings" were triggered by soldiers subjected to Extremis whose bodies explosively rejected the treatment. These explosions were falsely attributed to a terrorist plot in order to cover up Extremis's flaws. Stark witnesses Extremis first hand when Mandarin agents <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ellen_Brandt" title="Ellen Brandt">Brandt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Coldblood" title="Coldblood">Savin</a> attack him. Meanwhile, Killian resurfaces and kidnaps Potts and Hansen.

</p><p>With Harley's help, Stark traces the Mandarin to <a href="/wiki/Miami" title="Miami">Miami</a> and infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. Inside he discovers the Mandarin is actually an English actor named <a href="/wiki/Trevor_Slattery" title="Trevor Slattery">Trevor Slattery</a>, who is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image. Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin behind Slattery's cover. After capturing Stark, Killian reveals that he has subjected Potts to Extremis in the hope that Stark will help fix Extremis's flaws while trying to save her. Killian fatally shoots Hansen when she tries to stop him.
</p><p>Stark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard <a href="/wiki/Air_Force_One" title="Air Force One">Air Force One</a>, using the Iron Patriot armor. Stark saves some surviving passengers and crew but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. They trace Killian to an impounded damaged oil tanker where Killian intends to kill Ellis on live television. The Vice President will become a puppet leader, following Killian's orders in exchange for Extremis to cure his young daughter's disability. On the platform, Stark works to save Potts, as Rhodes goes after the President. Stark summons his remaining Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Rhodes secures the President and takes him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived the Extremis procedure; before he can save her, a rig collapses around them and she falls to her apparent death. Stark fights Killian and traps him in an Iron Man suit that he self-destructs, but fails to kill him. Potts, whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive her fall, intervenes and kills Killian.
</p><p>Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy each Iron Man suit as a sign of his devotion to Potts, while the Vice President and Slattery are arrested. With Stark's help, Potts' Extremis effects are stabilized, and Stark promises to scale back his life as Iron Man, undergoing surgery to remove the shrapnel near his heart and throwing his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea. He muses that, even without the technology, he will always be Iron Man.

Although Quill escapes with the orb, Yondu discovers his theft and issues a bounty for his capture, while Ronan sends the assassin <a href="/wiki/Gamora" title="Gamora">Gamora</a> after the orb.
</p><p>When Quill attempts to sell the orb on <a href="/wiki/Xandar" title="Xandar">Xandar</a>, capital of the Nova Empire, Gamora ambushes him and steals it. A fight ensues, drawing in a pair of bounty hunters: the genetically and cybernetically modified raccoon <a href="/wiki/Rocket_Raccoon" title="Rocket Raccoon">Rocket</a>, and the tree-like humanoid <a href="/wiki/Groot" title="Groot">Groot</a>. <a href="/wiki/Nova_Corps" title="Nova Corps">Nova Corps</a> officers capture the four, detaining them in the Kyln prison. A powerful inmate there, <a href="/wiki/Drax_the_Destroyer" title="Drax the Destroyer">Drax</a>, attempts to kill Gamora due to her association with Ronan and <a href="/wiki/Thanos" title="Thanos">Thanos</a>, who killed his family. Quill convinces Drax that Gamora can bring Ronan to him, though Gamora reveals that she has betrayed Ronan, unwilling to let him use the orb's power. Learning that Gamora has a buyer for the orb, Quill, Rocket, Groot, and Drax work with her to escape the Kyln in Quill's ship, the <i>Milano</i>.
</p><p>Ronan meets with Gamora's adoptive father, Thanos, to discuss her betrayal. Quill's group flee to <a href="/wiki/Knowhere" title="Knowhere">Knowhere</a>, a remote lawless outpost in space built in the giant severed head of a <a href="/wiki/Celestial_(comics)" title="Celestial (comics)">Celestial</a>. A drunken Drax summons Ronan while the rest of the group meet Gamora's contact, the collector <a href="/wiki/Collector_(comics)" title="Collector (comics)">Taneleer Tivan</a>. Tivan opens the orb, revealing the Power <a href="/wiki/Infinity_Gems" title="Infinity Gems">Infinity Stone</a>, an item of immeasurable power that destroys all but the most powerful beings who wield it. Tivan's slave Carina grabs the Stone, triggering an explosion that engulfs Tivan's archive.
</p><p>Ronan arrives and easily defeats Drax, while the others flee by ship, pursued by Ronan's followers and Gamora's adoptive sister <a href="/wiki/Nebula_(comics)" title="Nebula (comics)">Nebula</a>. Nebula destroys Gamora's ship, leaving her floating in space, and Ronan's fighters capture the orb. Quill contacts Yondu before following Gamora into space, giving her his helmet to survive; Yondu arrives and retrieves the pair. Rocket, Drax, and Groot threaten to attack Yondu's ship to rescue them, but Quill negotiates a truce, promising the orb to Yondu. Quill's group agrees that facing Ronan means certain death, but that they cannot let him use the Infinity Stone to destroy the galaxy. On Ronan's flagship, the <i>Dark Aster</i>, Ronan embeds the Stone in his warhammer, taking its power for himself. He contacts Thanos, threatening to kill him after first destroying Xandar; hateful of her adoptive father, Nebula allies with Ronan.
</p><p>The Ravagers and Quill's group join with the Nova Corps to confront the <i>Dark Aster</i> at Xandar, with Quill's group breaching the <i>Dark Aster</i> with the <i>Milano</i>. Ronan uses his empowered warhammer to destroy the Nova Corps fleet. Drax and Gamora defeat Korath and Nebula, the latter escaping, but the group find themselves outmatched by Ronan's power until Rocket crashes a Ravager ship through the <i>Dark Aster</i>. The damaged <i>Dark Aster</i> crash-lands on Xandar, with Groot sacrificing himself to shield the group. Ronan emerges from the wreck and prepares to destroy Xandar, but Quill distracts him, allowing Drax and Rocket to destroy Ronan's warhammer. Quill grabs the freed Stone, and with Gamora, Drax, and Rocket sharing its burden, they use it to disintegrate Ronan.
</p><p>In the aftermath, Quill tricks Yondu into taking a container supposedly containing the Stone, and gives the real Stone to the Nova Corps. As the Ravagers leave Xandar, Yondu remarks that it turned out well that they did not deliver Quill to his father per their contract. Quill's group, now known as the Guardians of the Galaxy, have their criminal records expunged, and Quill learns that he is only half-human, his father being part of an ancient, unknown species. Quill finally opens the last present he received from his mother: a cassette tape filled with her favorite songs. The Guardians leave in the rebuilt <i>Milano</i> along with a sapling <a href="/wiki/Cutting_(plant)" title="Cutting (plant)">cut</a> from Groot.

Rogers returns to the <a href="/wiki/Triskelion_(comics)" title="Triskelion (comics)">Triskelion</a>, S.H.I.E.L.D.'s headquarters, to confront Fury and is briefed about Project Insight: three <a href="/wiki/Helicarrier" title="Helicarrier">Helicarriers</a> linked to spy satellites, designed to preemptively eliminate threats. Unable to decrypt the data recovered by Romanoff, Fury becomes suspicious about Insight and asks senior S.H.I.E.L.D. official and Secretary of Internal Security <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alexander_Pierce" title="Alexander Pierce">Alexander Pierce</a> to delay the project.
</p><p>On his way to rendezvous with <a href="/wiki/Maria_Hill" title="Maria Hill">Maria Hill</a>, Fury is ambushed by assailants led by a mysterious assassin called the <a href="/wiki/Bucky_Barnes#Winter_Soldier" title="Bucky Barnes">Winter Soldier</a>. Fury escapes to Rogers' apartment, and warns Rogers that S.H.I.E.L.D. is compromised. Fury is gunned down by the Winter Soldier, before handing Rogers a <a href="/wiki/USB_flash_drive" title="USB flash drive">flash drive</a> containing data from the ship. Fury is pronounced dead during surgery, and Hill recovers the body. The next day, Pierce summons Rogers to the Triskelion. When Rogers withholds Fury's information, Pierce brands him a fugitive. Hunted by S.T.R.I.K.E., Rogers meets with Romanoff. Using data in the flash drive, they discover a secret S.H.I.E.L.D. bunker in New Jersey, where they activate a supercomputer containing the <a href="/wiki/Mind_uploading" title="Mind uploading">preserved consciousness</a> of <a href="/wiki/Arnim_Zola" title="Arnim Zola">Arnim Zola</a>.

The Insight Helicarriers will sweep the globe, using satellite-guided guns to eliminate these individuals. Rogers, Romanoff, and Wilson are ambushed by the Winter Soldier, who kills Sitwell. During the fight, Rogers recognizes the Winter Soldier as <a href="/wiki/Bucky_Barnes" title="Bucky Barnes">Bucky Barnes</a>, his childhood best friend who supposedly fell to his death on a mission, but was actually captured and experimented upon after WWII. Hill manages to extract the trio to a safehouse where Fury, who had faked his death, is waiting with plans to sabotage the Helicarriers by replacing their controller chips.
</p><p>After the World Security Council members arrive for the Helicarriers' launch, Rogers broadcasts Hydra's plot to everyone at the Triskelion. Romanoff, disguised as one of the Council members, disarms Pierce. Fury arrives and forces Pierce to unlock S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database so that Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra to the public. Following a struggle, Fury kills Pierce. Meanwhile, Rogers and Wilson storm two Helicarriers and replace the controller chips, but the Winter Soldier destroys Wilson's suit and fights Rogers on the third. Rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip, allowing Hill to take control and have the vessels destroy each other. Rogers refuses to fight the Winter Soldier in an attempt to reach his friend, but as the ship collides with the Triskelion, Rogers is thrown out into the <a href="/wiki/Potomac_River" title="Potomac River">Potomac River</a>.

</p><p>In London, astrophysicist Dr. <a href="/wiki/Jane_Foster_(comics)" title="Jane Foster (comics)">Jane Foster</a> and her intern Darcy Lewis travel to an abandoned factory where such portals have appeared, disrupting the laws of physics around them. Separating from the group, Foster is teleported to another world, where she is infected by the Aether. <a href="/wiki/Heimdall_(comics)" title="Heimdall (comics)">Heimdall</a> alerts Thor that Foster has moved beyond his near all-seeing vision, leading Thor to Earth. When Thor finds Foster, she inadvertently releases an unearthly force, and Thor returns with her to Asgard.

Despite Odin's orders not to leave Asgard, Thor reluctantly enlists the help of Loki, who knows of a secret portal to Svartalfheim, where they will use Foster to lure and confront Malekith, away from Asgard. In return, Thor promises Loki vengeance on Malekith for killing their mother. With Volstagg and Sif stalling Asgardian soldiers and Fandral assisting their escape, Thor, Loki, and Foster head to Svartalfheim.
</p><p>There, Loki tricks Malekith into drawing the Aether out of Foster, but Thor's attempt to destroy the exposed substance fails. Malekith merges with the Aether and leaves in his ship as Loki is fatally wounded while killing Algrim. Thor, cradling Loki in his arms, promises to tell their father of his sacrifice.

Believing the technology is dangerous if replicated, Pym vows to hide it as long as he lives.
</p><p>In the present day,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Timeline_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-Timeline-6">[N 1]</a></sup> Pym's estranged daughter, <a href="/wiki/Hope_Pym" title="Hope Pym">Hope van Dyne</a>, and former protégé, <a href="/wiki/Darren_Cross" title="Darren Cross">Darren Cross</a>, have forced him out of his company, Pym Technologies. Cross is close to perfecting a shrinking suit of his own, the <a href="/wiki/Yellowjacket_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Yellowjacket (Marvel Comics)">Yellowjacket</a>, which horrifies Pym.
</p><p>Upon his release from prison, well-meaning thief <a href="/wiki/Ant-Man_(Scott_Lang)" title="Ant-Man (Scott Lang)">Scott Lang</a> moves in with his old cellmate, Luis. Lang visits his daughter <a href="/wiki/Cassandra_Lang" title="Cassandra Lang">Cassie</a> unannounced and is chastised by his former wife Maggie and her police-detective fiancé, Paxton, for not providing child support. Unable to hold down a job because of his criminal record, Lang agrees to join Luis' crew and commit a burglary. Lang breaks into a house and cracks its safe, but only finds what he believes to be an old motorcycle suit, which he takes home. After trying the suit on, Lang accidentally shrinks himself to the size of an insect. Terrified by the experience, he returns the suit to the house, but is arrested on the way out. Pym, the homeowner, visits Lang in jail and smuggles the suit into his cell to help him break out.
</p><p>Pym, who manipulated Lang through an unknowing Luis into stealing the suit as a test, wants Lang to become the new Ant-Man to steal the Yellowjacket from Cross. Having been spying on Cross after discovering his intentions, Van Dyne and Pym train Lang to fight and to control ants. While Van Dyne harbors resentment towards Pym about her mother Janet's death, he reveals that Janet, known as the <a href="/wiki/Wasp_(comics)" title="Wasp (comics)">Wasp</a>, disappeared into a subatomic <a href="/wiki/Features_of_the_Marvel_Universe#Extradimensional_places" title="Features of the Marvel Universe">quantum realm</a> while disabling a <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> nuclear missile. Pym warns Lang that he could suffer a similar fate if he overrides his suit's regulator. They send him to steal a device that will aid their heist from the <a href="/wiki/Avengers_(comics)" title="Avengers (comics)">Avengers</a>' headquarters, where he briefly fights <a href="/wiki/Falcon_(comics)" title="Falcon (comics)">Sam Wilson</a>.
</p><p>Cross perfects the Yellowjacket and hosts an unveiling ceremony at Pym Technologies' headquarters. Lang, along with his crew and a swarm of flying ants, infiltrates the building during the event, sabotages the company's <a href="/wiki/Server_(computing)" title="Server (computing)">servers</a>, and plants explosives. When he attempts to steal the Yellowjacket, he, along with Pym and Van Dyne, are captured by Cross, who intends to sell both the Yellowjacket and Ant-Man suits to <a href="/wiki/Hydra_(comics)" title="Hydra (comics)">Hydra</a>. Lang breaks free and he and Van Dyne dispatch most of the Hydra agents, though one flees with a vial of Cross' particles and Pym is shot. Lang pursues Cross, while the explosives detonate, imploding the building as Pym and Van Dyne escape.
</p><p>Cross dons the Yellowjacket and attacks Lang before Lang is arrested by Paxton. Cross takes Cassie hostage to lure Lang into another fight. Lang overrides the regulator and shrinks to subatomic size to penetrate Cross' suit and sabotage it to shrink uncontrollably, killing Cross. Lang disappears into the quantum realm but manages to reverse the effects and returns to the <a href="/wiki/Macroscopic_scale" title="Macroscopic scale">macroscopic</a> world. Out of gratitude for Lang's heroism, Paxton covers for Lang to keep him out of prison. Seeing that Lang survived and returned from the quantum realm, Pym wonders if his wife is alive as well. Later, Lang meets up with Luis, who tells him that Wilson is looking for him.

Romanoff makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at <a href="/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan" title="Midtown Manhattan">Midtown Manhattan</a>. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth.

Fury explains that Vanko's father jointly invented the arc reactor with Stark, but when Anton tried to sell it for profit, Stark had him deported. The Soviets sent Anton to the gulag. Fury gives Stark some of his father's old material; a hidden message in the <a href="/wiki/Diorama" title="Diorama">diorama</a> of the 1974 Stark Expo proves to be a diagram of the structure of a new element. With the aid of his computer <a href="/wiki/Edwin_Jarvis#J.A.R.V.I.S." title="Edwin Jarvis">J.A.R.V.I.S.</a>, Stark synthesizes it.

After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. <a href="/wiki/Iron_Monger" title="Iron Monger">Obadiah Stane</a>, his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor for his chest. Personal assistant <a href="/wiki/Pepper_Potts" title="Pepper Potts">Pepper Potts</a> places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details, a suspicious Stark decides to keep his work to himself.
</p><p>At a charity event held by Stark Industries, reporter <a href="/wiki/Christine_Everhart" title="Christine Everhart">Christine Everhart</a> informs Stark that his company's weapons were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira. Stark then learns that Stane has been <a href="/wiki/Arms_trafficking" title="Arms trafficking">arms trafficking</a> to criminals worldwide and is staging a <a href="/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat" title="Coup d'état">coup</a> to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves the villagers. While flying home, Stark is shot at by two <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/F-22_Raptor" title="F-22 Raptor">F-22 Raptor</a> fighter jets. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone in an attempt to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who subdues Raza and has the rest of the group killed. Stane has a massive new suit <a href="/wiki/Reverse_engineering" title="Reverse engineering">reverse engineered</a> from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Potts to hack into its database. She discovers that Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged. Potts meets with Agent <a href="/wiki/Phil_Coulson" title="Phil Coulson">Phil Coulson</a> of <a href="/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D." title="S.H.I.E.L.D.">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a>, an <a href="/wiki/Intelligence_agency" title="Intelligence agency">intelligence agency</a>, to inform him of Stane's activities.
</p><p>Stane's scientists cannot duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the one from his chest. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building, and Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him. The next day, at a press conference, Stark defies suggestions from S.H.I.E.L.D. and publicly admits to being "Iron Man."

With Selvig's help, he is freed and resigns himself to exile on Earth as he develops a romance with Foster.
</p><p>Loki discovers that he is Laufey's biological son, adopted by Odin after the war ended. A weary Odin falls into the deep "Odinsleep" to recover his strength. Loki takes the throne in Odin's stead and offers Laufey the chance to kill Odin and retrieve the Casket.

Kissing Foster goodbye and vowing to return, he and his fellow Asgardians leave to confront Loki.
</p><p>In Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifröst Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifröst Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki apparently commits suicide by allowing himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval. Thor makes amends with Odin, admitting he is not ready to be king; meanwhile, on Earth, Foster and her team search for a way to open a portal to Asgard.

Overhearing Rogers' conversation with Barnes about wanting to help in the war, Dr. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Abraham_Erskine" title="Abraham Erskine">Abraham Erskine</a> allows Rogers to enlist.

</p><p>Schmidt and Dr. <a href="/wiki/Arnim_Zola" title="Arnim Zola">Arnim Zola</a> harness the energies of the Tesseract, intending to use the power to fuel Zola's inventions, mounting an offensive that will change the world. Schmidt discovers Erskine's location and dispatches assassin <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heinz_Kruger" title="Heinz Kruger">Heinz Kruger</a> to kill him. Erskine subjects Rogers to the super-soldier treatment, injecting him with a special serum and dosing him with "vita-rays". After Rogers emerges from the experiment taller and more muscular, an undercover Kruger kills Erskine and flees. Rogers pursues and captures Kruger, but the assassin avoids interrogation by committing suicide with a <a href="/wiki/Cyanide" title="Cyanide">cyanide</a> capsule.

Refusing to believe that Barnes is dead, Rogers has Carter and engineer <a href="/wiki/Howard_Stark" title="Howard Stark">Howard Stark</a> fly him behind enemy lines to mount a solo rescue attempt. Rogers infiltrates the fortress of Schmidt's Nazi division <a href="/wiki/Hydra_(comics)" title="Hydra (comics)">Hydra</a>, freeing Barnes and the other prisoners. Rogers confronts Schmidt, who removes a mask to reveal a red, skull-like visage that earned him the <a href="/wiki/Sobriquet" title="Sobriquet">sobriquet</a> "the Red Skull".

</p><p>At Culver University in Virginia, General <a href="/wiki/Thunderbolt_Ross" title="Thunderbolt Ross">Thunderbolt Ross</a> meets with Dr. <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Banner_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)" title="Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)">Bruce Banner</a>, the colleague and boyfriend of his daughter <a href="/wiki/Betty_Ross" title="Betty Ross">Betty</a>, regarding an experiment that Ross claims is meant to make humans immune to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gamma_radiation" title="Gamma radiation">gamma radiation</a>. The experiment—part of a <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a>-era <a href="/wiki/Weapon_Plus" title="Weapon Plus">"super soldier" program</a> that Ross hopes to recreate—fails, and the exposure to gamma radiation causes Banner to transform into the <a href="/wiki/Hulk" title="Hulk">Hulk</a> for brief periods of time, whenever his heart rate rises above 200 beats per minute. The Hulk destroys the lab and surrounding area, killing several people inside, and injuring the General and Betty, along with others outside. Banner becomes a fugitive from the U.S. military and Ross in particular, who wants to weaponize the Hulk.
</p><p>Five years later,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Timeline_10-0"><a href="#cite_note-Timeline-10">[N 2]</a></sup> Banner works at a bottling factory in <a href="/wiki/Rocinha" title="Rocinha">Rocinha</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a> in <a href="/wiki/Brazil" title="Brazil">Brazil</a>, while searching for a cure for his condition. On the internet, he collaborates with a colleague he knows only as "Mr. Blue", and to whom he is "Mr. Green". He is learning <a href="/wiki/Yoga" title="Yoga">Yoga</a> techniques to help keep control, and has not transformed in five months. After Banner cuts his finger, a drop of his blood falls into a bottle, and is eventually ingested by an elderly consumer in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Milwaukee,_Wisconsin" title="Milwaukee, Wisconsin">Milwaukee, Wisconsin</a>, giving him gamma sickness. Using the bottle to track down Banner, Ross sends a special forces team, led by Russian-born British <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Royal_Marine" title="Royal Marine">Royal Marine</a> <a href="/wiki/Abomination_(comics)" title="Abomination (comics)">Emil Blonsky</a>, to capture him. Banner transforms into the Hulk and defeats Blonsky's team. After Ross explains how Banner became the Hulk, Blonsky agrees to be injected with a small amount of a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton and impair his judgment.
</p><p>Banner returns to Culver University and reunites with Betty, who is dating psychiatrist <a href="/wiki/Doc_Samson" title="Doc Samson">Leonard Samson</a>. Banner is attacked a second time by Ross and Blonsky's forces, tipped off by the suspicious Samson, causing him to again transform into the Hulk. The ensuing battle outside the university proves futile for Ross' forces and they retreat, though Blonsky, whose sanity is faltering, attacks and mocks the Hulk. The Hulk severely injures Blonsky and flees with Betty. After the Hulk reverts to Banner, he and Betty go on the run, and Banner contacts Mr. Blue, who urges them to meet him in New York City. Mr. Blue is actually cellular biologist Dr. <a href="/wiki/Leader_(comics)" title="Leader (comics)">Samuel Sterns</a>, who tells Banner he has developed a possible antidote to Banner's condition. After a successful test, he warns Banner that the antidote may only reverse each individual transformation. Sterns reveals he has <a href="/wiki/Organic_synthesis" title="Organic synthesis">synthesized</a> Banner's blood samples, which Banner sent from Brazil, into a large supply, with the intention of applying its "limitless potential" to medicine. Fearful of the Hulk's power falling into the military's hands, Banner wishes to destroy the blood supply.
</p><p>Blonsky, now completely healed from the battle at Culver University, joins Ross' forces for a third attempt to take Banner into custody. They succeed and Banner, along with Betty, are taken away in a helicopter. Blonsky stays behind and orders Sterns to inject him with Banner's blood, as he covets the Hulk's power. Sterns warns that the combination of the super-soldier formula and Banner's blood may cause him to become an "abomination", but Blonsky insists. The experiment mutates Blonsky into a creature with size and strength surpassing that of the Hulk, but drives him insane. He attacks Sterns, who gets some of Banner's blood in a cut on his forehead, causing him to begin mutating as well. In his new monstrous form, Blonsky rampages through <a href="/wiki/Harlem" title="Harlem">Harlem</a>. 
</p><p>Realizing that the Hulk is the only one who can stop Blonsky, Banner convinces Ross to release him. He jumps from Ross' helicopter and transforms after hitting the ground. After a long and brutal battle through Harlem, the Hulk defeats Blonsky by nearly strangling him to death with a chain, but spares his life upon hearing Betty's plea, and leaves Blonsky for Ross and his forces to arrest. After having a peaceful moment with Betty, the Hulk flees New York.
</p><p>A month later, Banner is in <a href="/wiki/Bella_Coola,_British_Columbia" title="Bella Coola, British Columbia">Bella Coola, British Columbia</a>.

As Starkiller Base prepares to fire on D'Qar, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy it by attacking a critical facility. Using the <i>Falcon</i>, Han, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the facility, lower the planet's shields, find Rey, and plant explosives. Han confronts Kylo, calling him by his birth name, Ben, and implores him to abandon the dark side. Kylo refuses and kills Han, enraging Chewbacca, who shoots Kylo and sets off the explosives, allowing the Resistance to attack and destroy the base.
</p><p>The injured Kylo pursues Finn and Rey to the surface. Kylo defeats Finn in a lightsaber duel, leaving him wounded.

Disillusioned by his failure to train Kylo as a <a href="/wiki/Jedi" title="Jedi">Jedi</a>, and under self-imposed exile, Luke refuses to help and says that the Jedi should end. Meanwhile, the First Order uses a device to track the Resistance, and attacks them. Leia's son <a href="/wiki/Kylo_Ren" title="Kylo Ren">Kylo Ren</a> hesitates to fire on the lead Resistance ship after sensing his mother's presence, but his wingmen destroy the bridge, killing most of the Resistance's leaders.

After Kylo tells Rey what happened between him and Luke that caused him to choose the dark side, Luke confesses that he momentarily contemplated killing Kylo upon sensing that <a href="/wiki/Supreme_Leader_Snoke" title="Supreme Leader Snoke">Snoke</a> was corrupting him; this prompted Kylo to destroy Luke's new Jedi Order. Convinced that Kylo can be redeemed, Rey leaves Ahch-To. Luke prepares to burn the Jedi library, but hesitates. <a href="/wiki/Yoda" title="Yoda">Yoda</a>'s Force ghost appears and destroys the library by summoning a bolt of <a href="/wiki/Lightning" title="Lightning">lightning</a>, saying Rey has all she needs to learn, and encouraging Luke to learn from his failure.

In a bargain for his freedom, DJ reveals the Resistance's plan to the First Order, and the evacuation transports are slowly destroyed.
</p><p>Ordered to kill Rey, Kylo instead kills Snoke and defeats his guards alongside Rey. Rey hopes that Kylo has returned to the light side, but he instead asks her to rule the galaxy with him. Refusing, she and Kylo each use the Force to try to take <a href="/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Anakin Skywalker</a>'s lightsaber, splitting it in two. Holdo sacrifices herself by ramming into Snoke's flagship at lightspeed, crippling it. Rey escapes in the chaos, while Kylo declares himself Supreme Leader. BB-8 frees Finn and Rose; they defeat Phasma and join the survivors on Crait. When the First Order arrives, Poe, Finn, and Rose attack with old speeders.

Luke experiences a premonition of Han and Leia in pain and, against the wishes of Yoda and Obi-Wan, abandons his training to rescue them, promising to return and complete his training.
</p><p>Intending to hold Luke in <a href="/wiki/Suspended_animation" title="Suspended animation">suspended animation</a> by imprisoning him in carbonite, Vader selects Han to be frozen as a test subject.

Lando frees Leia and Chewbacca, but they are too late to stop Fett from departing with Solo aboard. They fight their way back to the <i>Falcon</i> and flee the city. Meanwhile, Luke arrives and engages Vader in a lightsaber duel that leads them over the city's central air shaft. Vader severs Luke's right hand, disarming him, and tempts him to join forces. Luke accuses Vader of murdering his father, but Vader reveals that he is Luke's father. Horrified, Luke drops into the air shaft and is ejected beneath the floating city, where he hangs on an antenna. He reaches out <a href="/wiki/Telepathy" title="Telepathy">telepathically</a> to Leia, who senses him and persuades Lando and Chewie to turn back.

</p><p>The Rebel Alliance learns that the Empire has been constructing a new <a href="/wiki/Death_Star" title="Death Star">Death Star</a> under the supervision of the <a href="/wiki/Palpatine" title="Palpatine">Emperor</a> himself. As the station is protected by an energy shield, Han leads a strike team to destroy the shield generator on the forest moon of <a href="/wiki/Endor_(Star_Wars)" title="Endor (Star Wars)">Endor</a>; doing so would allow a squadron of starfighters to destroy the Death Star. Luke and Leia accompany the strike team to Endor in a stolen Imperial shuttle. Luke and his companions encounter a tribe of <a href="/wiki/Ewok" title="Ewok">Ewoks</a> and, after an initial conflict, gain their trust. Later, Luke tells Leia that she is his sister, Vader is their father, and that he must confront him. Surrendering to Imperial troops, Luke is brought before Vader, and he tries to convince his father to return from the dark side of the Force.
</p><p>Vader takes Luke to the Death Star to meet the Emperor, intent on turning him to the dark side. The Emperor reveals that the Death Star is operational and that the Rebel Fleet will fall into a trap. On Endor, Han's team is captured by Imperial forces, but a counterattack by the Ewoks allows the Rebels to infiltrate the shield generator. Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Lando_Calrissian" title="Lando Calrissian">Lando Calrissian</a> leads the Rebel Fleet in the <i><a href="/wiki/Millennium_Falcon" title="Millennium Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a></i>, only to find that the Death Star's shield is still active, and the Imperial fleet waiting for them. The Emperor tempts Luke to give in to his anger, and Luke engages Vader in a lightsaber duel. Vader senses that Luke has a sister, and threatens to turn her to the dark side. Enraged, Luke attacks and severs Vader's <a href="/wiki/Prosthesis" title="Prosthesis">prosthetic</a> hand. The Emperor entreats Luke to kill Vader and take his place, but Luke refuses, declaring himself a Jedi as his father had been. Furious, the Emperor tortures Luke with Force lightning. Unwilling to let his son die, Vader throws the Emperor down a pit, but is mortally electrocuted in the process. At his last request, Luke removes the redeemed Anakin's mask before he dies in Luke's arms.
</p><p>After the strike team destroys the shield generator, Lando leads a group of Rebel fighters into the Death Star core and destroys its main reactor. As the <i>Falcon</i> flies out of the Death Star's superstructure and Luke escapes on a shuttle with his father's body, the station explodes. On Endor, Leia reveals to Han that Luke is her brother, and they kiss. Luke cremates Anakin's body on a <a href="/wiki/Pyre" title="Pyre">pyre</a>. As the defeat of the Empire is celebrated, Luke sees the spirits of Yoda, <span class="nowrap">Obi-Wan</span>, and Anakin watching over him.
</p><p>Research scientist Galen Erso and his family are in hiding on the planet Lah'mu when <a href="/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(Star_Wars)" title="Galactic Empire (Star Wars)">Imperial</a> weapons developer <a href="/wiki/Orson_Krennic" title="Orson Krennic">Orson Krennic</a> arrives to press him into completing the <a href="/wiki/Death_Star" title="Death Star">Death Star</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Space_station" title="Space station">space station</a>-based <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Superweapon" title="Superweapon">superweapon</a> capable of destroying entire planets.

</p><p>Thirteen years later, cargo pilot <a href="/wiki/Bodhi_Rook" title="Bodhi Rook">Bodhi Rook</a> defects from the Empire, taking a holographic message recorded by Galen to Gerrera on the desert moon <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jedha" title="Jedha">Jedha</a>.

Cassian is covertly ordered to kill Galen rather than extract him.

With the aid of blind spiritual warrior <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chirrut_%C3%8Emwe" title="Chirrut Îmwe">Chirrut Îmwe</a> and his mercenary friend <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Baze_Malbus" title="Baze Malbus">Baze Malbus</a>, Jyn makes contact with Gerrera, who has been holding Rook captive. Gerrera shows her the message, in which Galen reveals he has secretly built a vulnerability into the Death Star and directs them to retrieve the schematics from an Imperial data bank on the planet <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scarif" title="Scarif">Scarif</a>.
</p><p>On the Death Star, Krennic orders a low-powered test shot which destroys Jedha's capital. Jyn and her group take Rook and flee the moon, but Gerrera remains to die with the city. <a href="/wiki/Grand_Moff_Tarkin" title="Grand Moff Tarkin">Grand Moff Tarkin</a> congratulates Krennic before using Rook's defection and security leak as a pretext to take control of the project. Rook leads the group to Galen's Imperial research facility on the planet <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Eadu" title="Eadu">Eadu</a>, where Cassian chooses not to kill Galen. Jyn makes her presence known moments before Rebel bombers attack the facility. Galen is wounded and dies in his daughter's arms, before she escapes with her group on board a stolen Imperial cargo shuttle. Krennic is summoned by <a href="/wiki/Darth_Vader" title="Darth Vader">Darth Vader</a> to answer for the attack on Eadu. Krennic seeks his support for an audience with the <a href="/wiki/Palpatine" title="Palpatine">Emperor</a>, but Vader instead orders him to ensure no further breaches occur.
</p><p>Jyn proposes a plan to steal the Death Star schematics using the Rebel fleet but fails to gain approval from the Alliance Council, who feel victory against the Empire is now impossible. Frustrated at their inaction, Jyn's group lead a small squad of Rebel volunteers to raid the databank themselves. Arriving at Scarif on the stolen Imperial ship, which Rook dubs "Rogue One", a disguised Jyn and Cassian enter the base with K-2SO while the other Rebels attack the resident <a href="/wiki/Stormtrooper_(Star_Wars)" title="Stormtrooper (Star Wars)">Imperial garrison</a> as a diversion. The Rebel fleet learns of the raid from intercepted Imperial communications and deploy in support. K-2SO sacrifices himself so Jyn and Cassian can retrieve the data. Îmwe is killed after activating the master switch to allow communication with the Rebel fleet, and Malbus dies in battle shortly afterwards. Rook is killed by a grenade after informing the Rebel fleet that it must deactivate the shield surrounding the planet to allow the transmission of the schematics. Jyn and Cassian obtain the schematics, but they are ambushed by Krennic, who is eventually shot and wounded by Cassian. Jyn transmits the schematics to the Rebel command ship. The Death Star enters orbit above Scarif, where Tarkin uses another low-power shot to destroy the compromised base, killing Krennic, Cassian, and Jyn.
</p><p>The Rebel fleet prepares to jump to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hyperspace_(science_fiction)" title="Hyperspace (science fiction)">hyperspace</a>, but many of the fleet's ships are intercepted by Vader's flagship. Vader boards the Rebel command ship and attempts to regain the schematics, but a small starship escapes with the plans on board. Aboard the fleeing ship, <a href="/wiki/Princess_Leia" title="Princess Leia">Princess Leia</a> declares that the schematics will provide hope for the Rebellion.
</p><p>On the planet <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Corellia" title="Corellia">Corellia</a>, orphaned children are made to steal to survive. Lovers <a href="/wiki/Han_Solo" title="Han Solo">Han</a> and <a href="/wiki/Qi%27ra" title="Qi'ra">Qi'ra</a> make an escape from a local gang. They bribe an <a href="/wiki/Galactic_Empire_(Star_Wars)" title="Galactic Empire (Star Wars)">Imperial</a> officer with stolen coaxium (a powerful hyperspace fuel) for passage on an outgoing transport, but Qi'ra is apprehended before she can board. Han vows to return for her and joins the Imperial Navy as a flight cadet. When the recruiting officer asks for his surname, Han says he is alone with no family, so the recruiter gives him the last name "Solo".
</p><p>Three years later, Han has been expelled from the Imperial Flight Academy for insubordination and is serving as an infantryman on Mimban. He encounters a group of criminals posing as Imperial soldiers led by Tobias Beckett. Han attempts to blackmail them into taking him with them, but Beckett has him arrested for desertion and thrown into a pit to be fed to a <a href="/wiki/Wookiee" title="Wookiee">Wookiee</a> named <a href="/wiki/Chewbacca" title="Chewbacca">Chewbacca</a>. Able to understand Chewbacca's language, Han persuades him to cooperate to escape. Beckett, aware of the usefulness of a Wookiee's strength, rescues and enlists them in the gang to steal a shipment of coaxium on <span class="nowrap">Vandor-1</span>. The plan goes awry when the Cloud Riders, led by Enfys Nest, arrive, resulting in the deaths of two crew members, including Beckett's wife, and the destruction of the coaxium.
</p><p>Beckett reveals he was ordered to steal the shipment for Dryden Vos, a high-ranking crime boss in the Crimson Dawn syndicate. Han and Chewbacca volunteer to help him steal another shipment to repay the debt. They travel to Vos' yacht where Han finds Qi'ra, who has joined Crimson Dawn and is Vos' top lieutenant. Han suggests a risky plan to steal unrefined coaxium from the mines on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kessel_(Star_Wars)" title="Kessel (Star Wars)">Kessel</a>; Vos approves but insists that Qi'ra accompany the team. She leads them to <a href="/wiki/Lando_Calrissian" title="Lando Calrissian">Lando Calrissian</a>, an accomplished smuggler and pilot who she hopes will lend them his ship. Han challenges Lando to a game of sabacc, with the wager being Lando's ship. Lando cheats to win but agrees to join the mission in exchange for a share of the profits.
</p><p>After reaching Kessel in the <i><a href="/wiki/Millennium_Falcon" title="Millennium Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a></i> and infiltrating the mine, Lando's droid co-pilot L3-37 instigates a <a href="/wiki/Slave_rebellion" title="Slave rebellion">slave revolt</a>. In the confusion, they steal the coaxium, but L3 is severely damaged and Lando is injured during the escape. With the help of L3's navigational computer, hotwired into the ship's systems, Han pilots the ship through the dangerous and uncharted <a href="/wiki/Millennium_Falcon#Kessel_Run" title="Millennium Falcon">Kessel Run</a> to elude an Imperial blockade. The <i>Falcon</i>, badly damaged, lands on the planet Savareen to process the coaxium.
</p><p>During a confrontation with Enfys, who tracked the team from Vandor, Lando flees in the <i>Falcon</i>. Enfys explains to Han that she and her crew are not <a href="/wiki/Space_pirate" title="Space pirate">pirates</a>, but rebels trying to prevent the syndicates and Empire from gaining power. Han becomes sympathetic to their cause and tries to trick Vos, but Beckett has already alerted him to the double-cross. Vos sends his guards to kill Enfys, but the Cloud Riders overpower them instead, leaving Vos defenseless. Having anticipated Vos' strategy, Han tries to take the coaxium, only for Beckett to betray Vos, escaping with it and taking Chewbacca hostage. Qi'ra kills Vos and sends Han after Beckett. She contacts Vos' superior, the former Sith <a href="/wiki/Darth_Maul" title="Darth Maul">Maul</a>, to inform him of the mission's failure and claim Vos' position. She blames the failure on Beckett, never mentioning Han. Maul orders Qi'ra to meet with him on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dathomir" title="Dathomir">Dathomir</a>.
</p><p>Han catches up to Beckett and confronts him, shooting Beckett before he can return fire. With his dying words Beckett tells Han he made a smart choice. Qi'ra leaves in Vos' yacht, while Han and Chewbacca turn the coaxium over to Enfys, who offers Han a chance to join the rebellion against the Empire; when he declines, she gives him a vial of coaxium, enough to buy a ship of his own. Han and Chewbacca locate Lando and challenge him to a rematch in sabacc, once again wagering the <i>Falcon</i>. Han wins, having stolen the card Lando was keeping up his sleeve in order to cheat, and he and Chewbacca leave for <a href="/wiki/Tatooine" title="Tatooine">Tatooine</a>, where a crime lord is putting together a job.

Anakin begrudgingly accepts Ahsoka's apprenticeship, and the two succeed in deactivating the Separatists' energy field while Obi-Wan stalls the droid army commander, allowing a Republic victory. Ahsoka earns Anakin's respect.
</p><p>Following the battle, Yoda arrives and informs the Jedi that crime lord <a href="/wiki/Jabba_the_Hutt" title="Jabba the Hutt">Jabba the Hutt</a>'s son Rotta has been kidnapped. Anakin and Ahsoka are tasked with retrieving the Huttlet, while Obi-Wan is sent to <a href="/wiki/Tatooine" title="Tatooine">Tatooine</a> to negotiate with Jabba over a potential treaty between the Hutts and the Republic. Anakin and Ahsoka find Rotta on the planet Teth, where they are ambushed by Separatist forces led by <a href="/wiki/Count_Dooku" title="Count Dooku">Count Dooku</a>'s apprentice <a href="/wiki/Asajj_Ventress" title="Asajj Ventress">Asajj Ventress</a>, discovering that Dooku hopes to frame the Jedi for Rotta's kidnapping. The Jedi manage to escape the trap along with <a href="/wiki/R2-D2" title="R2-D2">R2-D2</a> and hijack a derelict transport with which they travel to Tatooine. Obi-Wan, alerted by Anakin, arrives on Teth and defeats Ventress in a <a href="/wiki/Lightsaber" title="Lightsaber">lightsaber</a> duel, though she manages to escape.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Senator <a href="/wiki/Padm%C3%A9_Amidala" title="Padmé Amidala">Padmé Amidala</a>, Anakin's secret wife, learns of Anakin's mission and fears for his safety. She decides to contact Jabba's uncle <a href="/wiki/Hutt_(Star_Wars)#Ziro_the_Hutt" title="Hutt (Star Wars)">Ziro</a> in Coruscant. The Hutt refuses to cooperate, apparently believing that it is the Jedi who are responsible for the situation. However, Padmé soon discovers that Ziro has actually conspired with Dooku to have Rotta killed in order for Jabba to have Anakin and Ahsoka executed in return, which will force the Jedi Council, led by Yoda, to take Jabba into custody and allow Ziro to seize power over the Hutt clans. Padmé is discovered and detained, but a chance call by <a href="/wiki/C-3PO" title="C-3PO">C-3PO</a> enables her to summon a squadron of clone troopers, and Ziro is arrested.
</p><p>Upon their arrival on Tatooine, Anakin and Ahsoka are shot down by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MagnaGuards" title="MagnaGuards">MagnaGuards</a>. Anakin devises a ruse to confront Dooku while carrying a decoy Rotta, leaving Ahsoka to take the real Rotta to Jabba's palace. While Anakin fights off Dooku, Ahsoka is ambushed by the MagnaGuards, whom she defeats. The two deliver Rotta safely to Jabba, who nonetheless orders the Jedi's execution for their supposed attempt to kidnap him. However, Padmé contacts Jabba in time and reveals Ziro and the Separatists' responsibility for the kidnapping.

Griphook agrees in exchange for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sword_of_Gryffindor" title="Sword of Gryffindor">Sword of Gryffindor</a>. Wandmaker <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ollivander" title="Ollivander">Ollivander</a> tells Harry that two wands taken from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Malfoy_Manor" title="Malfoy Manor">Malfoy Manor</a> belonged to Bellatrix and <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>, though Malfoy's has changed its allegiance to Harry.
</p><p>In the vault, Harry discovers the Horcrux is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Helga_Hufflepuff" title="Helga Hufflepuff">Helga Hufflepuff</a>'s cup. He retrieves it, but Griphook snatches the sword and abandons the trio, leaving them cornered by security. The three release the dragon guardian and flee on its back. Harry sees a vision of <a href="/wiki/Lord_Voldemort" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a> killing goblins including Griphook, and learns Voldemort is aware of the theft. Harry also realises there is a Horcrux at <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts" title="Hogwarts">Hogwarts</a> somehow connected to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rowena_Ravenclaw" title="Rowena Ravenclaw">Rowena Ravenclaw</a>.

</p><p><a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> hears of Harry's return and warns staff and students of punishment for aiding Harry. Harry confronts Snape, who flees after <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a> challenges him to a duel. McGonagall gathers the Hogwarts community for battle.

In the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chamber_of_Secrets" title="Chamber of Secrets">Chamber of Secrets</a>, Hermione destroys the Horcrux cup with a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Basilisk_(Harry_Potter)" title="Basilisk (Harry Potter)">Basilisk</a> fang. In the Room of Requirement, Draco, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Blaise_Zabini" title="Blaise Zabini">Blaise Zabini</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gregory_Goyle" title="Gregory Goyle">Gregory Goyle</a> attack Harry, but Ron and Hermione intervene. Goyle casts a Fiendfyre curse; unable to control it, he is burned to death while Harry and his friends save Malfoy and Zabini. Harry stabs the diadem with the Basilisk fang, and Ron kicks it into the Room of Requirement to be destroyed. As Voldemort's army attacks, Harry, seeing into Voldemort's mind, realises that Voldemort's snake <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nagini_(Harry_Potter)" title="Nagini (Harry Potter)">Nagini</a> is the final Horcrux. After entering the boathouse, the trio witness Voldemort telling Snape that the Elder Wand cannot serve Voldemort until Snape dies; he then orders Nagini to kill Snape. Before dying, Snape tells Harry to take his memories to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pensieve" title="Pensieve">Pensieve</a>. Meanwhile, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fred_Weasley" title="Fred Weasley">Fred Weasley</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Remus_Lupin" title="Remus Lupin">Remus Lupin</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nymphadora_Tonks" title="Nymphadora Tonks">Nymphadora Tonks</a> are killed in the chaos at Hogwarts.
</p><p>Harry learns from Snape's memories that while Snape despised Harry's late father <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/James_Potter_(character)" title="James Potter (character)">James</a>, who bullied him, he loved his late mother <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lily_Potter" title="Lily Potter">Lily</a>. Following her death, Snape worked with <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> to protect Harry from Voldemort due to his love for Lily. Harry also learns that Dumbledore was dying and wished for Snape to kill him, and that the Patronus doe he saw in the woods that led him to the sword was conjured by Snape. Harry discovers that he himself became a Horcrux when Voldemort originally failed to kill him; he must die to destroy the piece of Voldemort's soul within himself. Harry surrenders himself to Voldemort in the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts#Forbidden_Forest" title="Hogwarts">Forbidden Forest</a>. Voldemort casts the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Avada_Kedavra" title="Avada Kedavra">Killing Curse</a> upon Harry, who finds himself in <a href="/wiki/Limbo" title="Limbo">limbo</a>. Dumbledore's spirit meets him and explains that the part of Voldemort within Harry was killed by Voldemort's curse. Harry returns to his body, determined to defeat Voldemort.
</p><p>Voldemort announces Harry's apparent death to everyone at Hogwarts and demands their surrender. As Neville gives a defiant response and draws the sword from the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sorting_Hat" title="Sorting Hat">Sorting Hat</a>, Harry reveals he is still alive; the Malfoys and many <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a> abandon Voldemort. While Harry confronts Voldemort in a duel throughout the castle, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Molly_Weasley" title="Molly Weasley">Molly Weasley</a> kills Bellatrix in the Great Hall and Neville decapitates Nagini, making Voldemort mortal. Harry and Voldemort's fight ends with Voldemort's own Killing Curse rebounding and obliterating him. After the battle, Harry explains to Ron and Hermione that the Elder Wand recognised him as its true master after he disarmed Draco, who had earlier disarmed its previous owner, Dumbledore. Harry destroys the Elder Wand rather than claim it.
</p><p>Nineteen years later, Harry, <a href="/wiki/Ginny_Weasley" title="Ginny Weasley">Ginny Weasley</a>, Ron, Hermione, and Draco proudly watch their own children leave for Hogwarts at <a href="/wiki/London_King%27s_Cross_railway_station" title="London King's Cross railway station">King's Cross station</a>.
</p><p>In late 1981, <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a>, professors of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry</a>, deliver a recently orphaned infant named <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_(character)" title="Harry Potter (character)">Harry Potter</a> to his only remaining relatives, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Dursleys" title="The Dursleys">the Dursleys</a>. Ten years later, Harry has been battling a disjointed life with the Dursleys. After inadvertently causing an accident during a family trip to the zoo, Harry begins receiving unsolicited letters by owls. After the Dursleys escape to an island to avoid more letters, Hagrid re-appears and informs Harry that he is actually a wizard and has been accepted into Hogwarts against the Dursleys' wishes. After taking Harry to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Diagon_Alley" title="Diagon Alley">Diagon Alley</a> to buy his supplies for Hogwarts and a pet owl named Hedwig as a birthday present, Hagrid informs him of his past; Harry's parents <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix_(fictional_organisation)" title="Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)">James and Lily Potter</a> met their demise via a <a href="/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter#Unforgivable_Curses" title="Magic in Harry Potter">Killing Curse</a> at the hands of the malevolent and all-powerful wizard: <a href="/wiki/Lord_Voldemort" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a>. Harry, the only survivor in the chaos, thus becomes well-known in the wizarding world as "The Boy Who Lived".
</p><p>Harry is then taken to <a href="/wiki/London_King%27s_Cross_railway_station" title="London King's Cross railway station">King's Cross station</a> to board a train to Hogwarts, where he meets three other students: <a href="/wiki/Ron_Weasley" title="Ron Weasley">Ron Weasley</a>, whom he quickly befriends; <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a>, an intelligent witch born to <a href="/wiki/Muggle" title="Muggle">muggle</a> parents; and <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>, a boy from a wealthy wizarding family, with whom he immediately clashes. After arriving at school the students assemble in the Great Hall, where all the first-years are sorted by the <a href="/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Sorting_Hat" title="Magical objects in Harry Potter">Sorting Hat</a> between four houses: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hufflepuff" title="Hufflepuff">Hufflepuff</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ravenclaw" title="Ravenclaw">Ravenclaw</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a>. Although the Sorting Hat considers putting Harry in Slytherin with Draco, he is placed into Gryffindor alongside Ron and Hermione.
</p><p>At Hogwarts, Harry begins learning magic spells and discovers more about his past and parents. After recovering the <a href="/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Remembrall" title="Magical objects in Harry Potter">Remembrall</a> of Gryffindor student <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Neville_Longbottom" title="Neville Longbottom">Neville Longbottom</a>, Harry is recruited for Gryffindor's <a href="/wiki/Quidditch" title="Quidditch">Quidditch</a> team as a Seeker, an extremely rare feat for first-year students. On their way to the dorms one night the stair cases change paths leading the three to the forbidden floor of Hogwarts, Harry, Ron, and Hermione discover a <a href="/wiki/Cerberus" title="Cerberus">giant three-headed dog</a> named Fluffy in a restricted area of the school. Ron then insults Hermione after being embarrassed by her in a charms lesson, causing Hermione to lock herself in the girls' bathroom. She is attacked by a marauding troll, but Harry and Ron save her - befriending her in the process.
</p><p>The children later find out Fluffy is guarding the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone" title="Philosopher's Stone">Philosopher's Stone</a>, an object that has the power to turn any metal into <a href="/wiki/Gold" title="Gold">gold</a> and produce a <a href="/wiki/Elixir_of_life" title="Elixir of life">potion that grants immortality</a>. Harry suspects that potions teacher and head of Slytherin House <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> is trying to obtain the stone in order to return Voldemort to physical form. Hagrid accidentally reveals to the trio that Fluffy will fall asleep if played music. Harry, Ron, and Hermione decide that night to try and find the stone before Snape. They discover an already asleep Fluffy and face a series of safeguards including a deadly plant known as Devil's Snare, a room filled with aggressive flying keys that bruise Harry, and a dangerous life-sized game of <a href="/wiki/Chess" title="Chess">chess</a> that almost kills Ron.
</p><p>After getting past the tasks, Harry discovers that it was <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> teacher <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quirinus_Quirrell" title="Quirinus Quirrell">Quirinus Quirrell</a> who was trying to claim the stone: Snape had actually been protecting Harry all along. Quirrell removes his turban and reveals a weak Voldemort living on the back of his head. Through an enchantment placed by Dumbledore, Harry finds the stone in his possession. Voldemort attempts to bargain the stone from Harry in exchange for reviving his parents, but Harry refuses. Quirrell attempts to kill Harry in response; however, he is instead killed after Harry ends up burning his skin - reducing Quirrell to dust and causing Voldemort's to rise from his ashes. Harry is knocked unconscious in the process.
</p><p>Harry recovers in the school hospital with Dumbledore at his side. Dumbledore explains that the stone has been destroyed and that Ron and Hermione are safe. Dumbledore also reveals how Harry was able to defeat Quirrell: when Harry's mother died to save him, her death gave Harry a love-based protection against Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances - tying them for first place with Slytherin. Dumbledore then awards ten points to Neville for attempting to stop the trio, granting Gryffindor the House Cup. Harry returns home for the summer, happy to finally have a real home in Hogwarts.

The trio seek refuge at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Number_12,_Grimmauld_Place" title="Number 12, Grimmauld Place">Number 12, Grimmauld Place</a>. They discover that the "R.A.B." from the fake Horcrux locket is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Regulus_Arcturus_Black" title="Regulus Arcturus Black">Regulus Arcturus Black</a>, younger brother of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sirius_Black" title="Sirius Black">Sirius Black</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Kreacher" title="Kreacher">Kreacher</a>, the Blacks' house elf, tells them that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mundungus_Fletcher" title="Mundungus Fletcher">Mundungus Fletcher</a> broke in and stole many items from the house, including the real locket.

Using Polyjuice Potion, the trio infiltrate the Ministry and find the locket around Umbridge's neck. Harry stuns Umbridge and Hermione retrieves the locket. The trio escape their pursuers by apparating in the wilderness, but Ron is injured and cannot apparate again until he recovers.
</p><p>After unsuccessful attempts to destroy the Horcrux, the trio take turns wearing it to dilute its power. Harry sees a vision of Voldemort interrogating and killing the wand-maker <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gregorovitch" title="Gregorovitch">Gregorovitch</a>, who claims a teenage boy stole the legendary <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Elder_Wand" title="Elder Wand">Elder Wand</a> from his shop. While Ron is wearing the locket, he is overcome by negative feelings and falls out with Harry before abandoning him and Hermione. Hermione deduces that the Sword of Gryffindor can destroy Horcruxes and decides to go with Harry to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Godric%27s_Hollow" title="Godric's Hollow">Godric's Hollow</a>. They visit Harry's parents' graves and the house where they were killed. They encounter <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bathilda_Bagshot" title="Bathilda Bagshot">Bathilda Bagshot</a>, who they believe may have the sword. Bathilda lets them into her house before revealing herself as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nagini_(Harry_Potter)" title="Nagini (Harry Potter)">Nagini</a>, possessing Bathilda's reanimated corpse. Hermione and Harry escape into the <a href="/wiki/Forest_of_Dean" title="Forest of Dean">Forest of Dean</a>, but Hermione accidentally breaks Harry's wand whilst fighting Nagini. She identifies the mysterious thief in Harry's vision as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald" title="Gellert Grindelwald">Gellert Grindelwald</a>.
</p><p>Harry sees a Patronus in the form of a doe, which leads him to a frozen pond. Gryffindor's sword lies beneath the pond's ice, which Harry breaks and jumps into. The locket around his neck strangles Harry, but Ron arrives and rescues him. Harry uses <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parseltongue" title="Parseltongue">parseltongue</a> to open the Horcrux locket, which Ron eventually decides to destroy. Hermione and Ron reconcile, and the trio decide to visit <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Xenophilius_Lovegood" title="Xenophilius Lovegood">Xenophilius Lovegood</a> to learn more about a symbol left in the book Dumbledore left Hermione. Lovegood explains to them that the symbol represents the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Deathly_Hallows_(objects)" title="Deathly Hallows (objects)">Deathly Hallows</a>, three magical objects that can make a wizard master of Death. Hermione reads the story of the Hallows, after which the trio awkwardly attempt to leave but are stopped by Lovegood. He reveals that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna Lovegood</a> has been kidnapped and then summons the Death Eaters, intending to hand over Harry in exchange for her. Harry, Ron, and Hermione disapparate as Lovegood's house is destroyed.
</p><p>Back in the wilderness, the trio set up camp when Snatchers find them. Hermione uses a curse to disguise Harry as the Snatchers take them to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Malfoy_Manor" title="Malfoy Manor">Malfoy Manor</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a> imprisons Harry and Ron in the cellar with Luna, Ollivander, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Griphook" title="Griphook">Griphook</a> the goblin.

Harry requests help, communicating with a broken mirror in his possession. Dobby apparates into the cellar to save them. Harry and Ron rush to save Hermione, and a battle ensues that sees Harry disarm <a href="/wiki/Draco_Malfoy" title="Draco Malfoy">Draco Malfoy</a>. Dobby drops a chandelier onto Bellatrix, forcing her to release Hermione. Bellatrix throws her knife at them as Dobby grabs everyone and disapparates. They arrive at Shell Cottage to find that Bellatrix's knife has fatally wounded Dobby. Harry insists that they bury Dobby without any magic. Meanwhile, Voldemort breaks into Dumbledore's tomb and steals the Elder Wand, revealed to have been in Dumbledore's possession.

The building also serves as the headquarters of the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_the_Phoenix_(fictional_organisation)" title="Order of the Phoenix (fictional organisation)">Order of the Phoenix</a>, a secret organisation founded by <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a> which informs Harry that the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic" title="Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> is refusing to believe <a href="/wiki/Lord_Voldemort" title="Lord Voldemort">Lord Voldemort</a>'s return. At the Order's headquarters, Sirius mentions that Voldemort is after a special object he did not have during his previous attack.
</p><p>Harry's expulsion is reversed at a hearing of the Ministry of Magic and he returns to Hogwarts for his fifth year, where Minister of Magic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">Cornelius Fudge</a> has appointed a new <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Defence_Against_the_Dark_Arts" title="Defence Against the Dark Arts">Defence Against the Dark Arts</a> professor: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dolores_Umbridge" title="Dolores Umbridge">Dolores Umbridge</a>. Umbridge immediately clashes with Harry and punishes him for his "lies" about Voldemort by forcing him to write a message with a magic quill, scarring his hand. Despite the concern of his best friends <a href="/wiki/Hermione_Granger" title="Hermione Granger">Hermione Granger</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ron_Weasley" title="Ron Weasley">Ron Weasley</a>, Harry refuses to report Umbridge's punishment to Dumbledore, who has mysteriously been ignoring Harry since the summer. As Umbridge's control over the school increases, Harry, Hermione and Ron form a secret group to train students in defensive spells, calling themselves "<a href="/wiki/Dumbledore%27s_Army" title="Dumbledore's Army">Dumbledore's Army</a>". Umbridge tasks the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a> students with exposing the group, forming the "Inquisitorial Squad". Meanwhile, Harry and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cho_Chang" title="Cho Chang">Cho Chang</a> develop romantic feelings for each other.
</p><p>Harry has a vision involving an attack upon <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a>, from the point of view of Arthur's attacker. Concerned that Voldemort will exploit this connection to Harry, Dumbledore instructs <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> to give Harry <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Occlumency" title="Occlumency">Occlumency</a> lessons to defend his mind from Voldemort's influence. These end after Harry discovers through Snape's memories why Snape hated Harry's father James (who often ridiculed him). The connection causes Harry to further isolate himself from his friends. Meanwhile, Sirius' deranged <a href="/wiki/Death_Eater" title="Death Eater">Death Eater</a> cousin <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bellatrix_Lestrange" title="Bellatrix Lestrange">Bellatrix Lestrange</a> escapes from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a> along with nine other <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Death_Eaters" title="Death Eaters">Death Eaters</a>. At Hogwarts, Umbridge and her "Inquisitorial Squad" expose Dumbledore's Army by forcing Cho to drink <a href="/wiki/Potions_in_Harry_Potter#Veritaserum" title="Potions in Harry Potter">Veritaserum</a>. Dumbledore escapes as Fudge orders his arrest. Umbridge becomes the new Headmistress.
</p><p>Harry's refusal to forgive Cho causes their relationship to fall apart. After seeing another vision where Sirius is tortured by Voldemort, Harry, Ron and Hermione rush to Umbridge's fireplace to alert the Order via the Floo Network but are caught by her. When Umbridge threatens to use the <a href="/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter#Unforgivable_Curses" title="Magic in Harry Potter">Cruciatus Curse</a> on Harry, Hermione tricks her into entering the <a href="/wiki/Hogwarts#Forbidden_Forest" title="Hogwarts">Forbidden Forest</a> in search of Dumbledore's "secret weapon". Hermione and Harry lead Umbridge to the hiding place of <a href="/wiki/Rubeus_Hagrid" title="Rubeus Hagrid">Rubeus Hagrid</a>'s giant half-brother <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Grawp" title="Grawp">Grawp</a>, only to be confronted by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Centaurs" title="Centaurs">centaurs</a> who kidnap Umbridge after she attacks and insults them.

The six enter the Department of Mysteries and uncover a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Prophecy_(Harry_Potter)" title="Prophecy (Harry Potter)">bottled prophecy</a>, the object Voldemort was after. However, they are ambushed by Death Eaters led by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lucius_Malfoy" title="Lucius Malfoy">Lucius Malfoy</a> and Bellatrix. Lucius reveals that Harry only saw a dream of Sirius being tortured, which served as a ruse to lure Harry into the Death Eaters' grasp. Harry refuses to give Lucius the prophecy, causing a fight between Dumbledore's Army and the Death Eaters.
</p><p>The Death Eaters capture everyone except Harry, threatening to kill them unless he surrenders the prophecy. As Harry obliges, the Order arrive and attack the Death Eaters. This causes Lucius to drop the prophecy, destroying it. Just as Sirius overpowers Lucius, he is killed by Bellatrix. Voldemort appears, but Dumbledore arrives through the Floo Network moments before he can kill Harry. A duel between Voldemort and Dumbledore ensues, which destroys much of the Atrium while Bellatrix escapes. Unable to defeat Dumbledore, Voldemort possesses Harry to tempt Dumbledore into sacrificing him but the love Harry feels for his friends and Sirius makes it impossible for Voldemort to remain in his body.
</p><p>Ministry officials arrive right before Voldemort <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Apparition_(Harry_Potter)" title="Apparition (Harry Potter)">disapparates</a>; Fudge is forced to admit Voldemort's return and is forced out of his position as Minister in disgrace. Umbridge is removed from Hogwarts, and Dumbledore returns as headmaster. Dumbledore explains that he distanced himself from Harry throughout the year, hoping it would lessen the risk of Voldemort using their connection. Harry comes to terms with the prophecy: "Neither can live while the other survives."

Harry is found and saved by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Luna_Lovegood" title="Luna Lovegood">Luna Lovegood</a>.
</p><p>At Hogwarts, Harry and Ron borrow textbooks for Slughorn's Potions class, and Harry is stuck with a copy that turns out to be filled with helpful notes and spells left by the "Half-Blood Prince". Harry uses the book to excel in the class and impresses Slughorn, winning a <a href="/wiki/Potions_in_Harry_Potter#Felix_Felicis" title="Potions in Harry Potter">Liquid Luck potion</a>.

</p><p>Harry spends the Christmas holidays with the Weasleys. On Christmas Eve, Harry discusses his suspicions about Draco to the Order of the Phoenix. His suspicions are dismissed, but <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arthur_Weasley" title="Arthur Weasley">Arthur Weasley</a> later tells Harry privately that the Malfoys may have been interested in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Magical_Objects_in_Harry_Potter#Vanishing_Cabinet" title="Magical Objects in Harry Potter">Vanishing Cabinet</a>. Bellatrix and Greyback attack and burn down the Burrow, drawing Harry into a battle. He saves Ginny before the Order arrive and fight off the Death Eaters. At Hogwarts, Dumbledore reveals to Harry that Slughorn possesses a memory of Voldemort that Dumbledore desperately needs. He asks Harry to confront Slughorn and retrieve the real memory, after being given an altered version that made it appear as though Slughorn did not know anything. Harry is unable to convince Slughorn.
</p><p>After Ron accidentally ingests a <a href="/wiki/Potions_in_Harry_Potter#Amortentia" title="Potions in Harry Potter">love potion</a> intended for Harry, Harry cures him with Slughorn's help. The trio celebrate with <a href="/wiki/Mead" title="Mead">mead</a> that Slughorn had intended to gift to Dumbledore. The mead poisons Ron, and Harry is forced to save his life after Slughorn hesitates. Ron murmurs Hermione's name while recovering in the infirmary, causing Lavender to end their relationship. Harry confronts Draco about the mead and a cursed necklace, and the two duel. Harry uses a curse from the Half-Blood Prince's potion book to severely injure Malfoy, who is rescued and healed by Snape. Fearing the book may be filled with more <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dark_Magic" title="Dark Magic">Dark Magic</a>, Ginny and Harry hide it in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Room_of_Requirement" title="Room of Requirement">Room of Requirement</a> and share their first kiss.
</p><p>Harry decides to use his Liquid Luck potion to convince Slughorn to give up the memory Dumbledore needs. Harry views the memory with Dumbledore and learns that Voldemort wanted information for creating <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Horcrux" title="Horcrux">Horcruxes</a>, magical objects that could contain pieces of a wizard's soul and make them immortal. Dumbledore concludes that Voldemort successfully divided his soul into seven pieces by creating six Horcruxes, two of which have already been destroyed: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tom_Riddle%27s_diary" title="Tom Riddle's diary">Tom Riddle's diary</a> by Harry and <a href="/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Marvolo_Gaunt's_Ring" title="Magical objects in Harry Potter">Marvolo Gaunt's ring</a> by him.

</p><p>A weakened Dumbledore defends them from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Inferius" title="Inferius">Inferi</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Apparate" title="Apparate">apparates</a> back to Hogwarts. Bellatrix, Greyback, and more Death Eaters enter Hogwarts with Draco's help through the Vanishing Cabinet in the Room of Requirement that Draco managed to connect to the one he had been working on in Knockturn Alley. Dumbledore instructs Harry to hide and not interfere under any circumstance. Draco arrives in the Astronomy Tower and disarms Dumbledore revealing that he has been chosen by Voldemort to kill the headmaster. Snape arrives, and casts the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Avada_Kedavra" title="Avada Kedavra">killing curse</a> on Dumbledore when Draco is unable to bring himself to do it, killing the Headmaster. He then overpowers Harry and reveals himself as the Half-Blood Prince before escaping.
</p><p>Harry returns to Hogwarts, where the students, staff, and a few guests mourn Dumbledore's death. He later reveals to Ron and Hermione that the locket Horcrux was a fake. The locket contains a message from "<a href="/wiki/Death_Eater#Regulus_Black" title="Death Eater">R.A.B.</a>", stating that he has stolen the real Horcrux with the intent of destroying it. Rather than returning for their final year at Hogwarts, the three decide to leave and track down the remaining Horcruxes.

He also announces that the school will host an event known as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Triwizard_Tournament" title="Triwizard Tournament">Triwizard Tournament</a>, in which three magical schools compete across three dangerous challenges. The <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Goblet_of_Fire" title="Goblet of Fire">Goblet of Fire</a> selects "champions" to take part in the competition: <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cedric_Diggory" title="Cedric Diggory">Cedric Diggory</a> of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hufflepuff" title="Hufflepuff">Hufflepuff</a> representing Hogwarts, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Viktor_Krum" title="Viktor Krum">Viktor Krum</a> representing the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Durmstrang_Institute" title="Durmstrang Institute">Durmstrang Institute</a> from Eastern Europe, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fleur_Delacour" title="Fleur Delacour">Fleur Delacour</a> representing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Beauxbatons_Academy_of_Magic" title="Beauxbatons Academy of Magic">Beauxbatons Academy of Magic</a> from <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>. The Goblet then unexpectedly selects Harry as a fourth champion. Dumbledore is unable to pull the underage Harry out of the tournament, as Ministry official <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Barty_Crouch_Sr." title="Barty Crouch Sr.">Barty Crouch Sr.</a> insists that the champions are bound by a contract after being selected.
</p><p>For the first task, each champion must retrieve a golden egg guarded by the dragon they pick. Harry succeeds in retrieving the egg, which contains information about the second challenge. Shortly after, a formal dance event known as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Yule_Ball" title="Yule Ball">Yule Ball</a> takes place; Harry and Ron attends with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parvati_Patil" title="Parvati Patil">Parvati</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Padma_Patil" title="Padma Patil">Padma Patil</a>, Harry's crush <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cho_Chang" title="Cho Chang">Cho Chang</a> attends with Cedric, and Hermione attends with Viktor, making Ron jealous. The second task involves the champions diving underwater to rescue their mates. Harry finishes third, but is promoted to second behind Cedric due to his "moral fibre", after saving Fleur's sister Gabrielle as well as Ron. Afterwards, Harry discovers the corpse of Crouch Sr. in the forest. Later, while waiting for Dumbledore in his office, Harry discovers a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pensieve" title="Pensieve">Pensieve</a>, which holds Dumbledore's memories. Harry witnesses a trial in which <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Igor_Karkaroff" title="Igor Karkaroff">Igor Karkaroff</a> confesses to the <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic" title="Ministry of Magic">Ministry of Magic</a> names of other Death Eaters after Voldemort's defeat. When he names <a href="/wiki/Severus_Snape" title="Severus Snape">Severus Snape</a> as one, Dumbledore vouches for Snape's innocence; Snape turned spy against Voldemort before the latter's downfall. After Karkaroff names Barty Crouch Jr., a devastated Crouch Sr. imprisons his son in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a>. Exiting the Pensieve, Harry realizes that Crouch Jr. is the man he saw in his dream.
</p><p>For the final task, the champions must reach the Triwizard Cup, located in a <a href="/wiki/Hedge_maze" title="Hedge maze">hedge maze</a>. After Fleur and Viktor are incapacitated, Harry and Cedric reach the cup together. The two claim a draw and together grab the cup, which turns out to be a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Portkey" title="Portkey">Portkey</a> and transports them to a graveyard where Pettigrew and Voldemort are waiting. Pettigrew kills Cedric with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Avada_Kedavra" title="Avada Kedavra">Killing Curse</a> and performs a ritual that rejuvenates Voldemort, who then summons the Death Eaters. Voldemort releases Harry and challenges him to a duel to prove he is the better wizard. A vulnerable Harry tries the Expelliarmus charm to block Voldemort's attempted Killing Curse. The beams from their wands entwine and Voldemort's wand disgorges the last spells it performed. The spirits of the people he murdered are seen in the graveyard, including Cedric, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lily_and_James_Potter" title="Lily and James Potter">Harry's parents</a>. This distracts Voldemort and his Death Eaters, allowing Harry to use the Portkey and escape with Cedric's body.
</p><p>Harry tells Dumbledore that Voldemort returned and killed Cedric. Moody takes Harry back to his office to interrogate him about Voldemort, but inadvertently blows his cover by asking Harry whether there were "others in the graveyard", despite Harry not mentioning a graveyard. Moody reveals that he submitted Harry's name to the Goblet of Fire and manipulated Harry throughout the tournament to ensure he would win. Moody attempts to attack Harry, but Dumbledore, Snape, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall" title="Minerva McGonagall">Minerva McGonagall</a> intervene and subdue him. The teachers force Moody to drink <a href="/wiki/Potions_in_Harry_Potter#Veritaserum" title="Potions in Harry Potter">Veritaserum</a>, and he reveals that the real Moody is imprisoned in a magical trunk as his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polyjuice_Potion" title="Polyjuice Potion">Polyjuice Potion</a> wears off. He is revealed as Crouch Jr. and returned to Azkaban.
</p><p>Dumbledore reveals to the students that Voldemort killed Cedric, although the Ministry of Magic opposes the revelation. Later, Dumbledore visits Harry in his dormitory, apologizing to him for the dangers he endured. Harry reveals that he saw his parents in the graveyard; Dumbledore names this effect as "<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Priori_Incantatem" title="Priori Incantatem">Priori Incantatem</a>".

Harry and Ron suspect Malfoy as the Heir, so Hermione suggests they question him while disguised using <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Polyjuice_potion" title="Polyjuice potion">polyjuice potion</a>. They utilise a disused bathroom haunted by a ghost, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Moaning_Myrtle" title="Moaning Myrtle">Moaning Myrtle</a>, as their makeshift laboratory to brew the potion.
</p><p>When Harry communicates with a snake, the school believes he is the Heir. On Christmas Day, Harry and Ron learn that Malfoy is not the Heir, but he mentions that a muggle-born girl died when the Chamber was last opened fifty years ago. Harry finds an enchanted diary owned by former Hogwarts student <a href="/wiki/Lord_Voldemort" title="Lord Voldemort">Tom Riddle</a>, which contains a flashback fifty years prior where Riddle accused Hagrid, then a student, of opening the Chamber. When the diary is stolen and Hermione is petrified, Harry and Ron question Hagrid. <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Professor Dumbledore</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cornelius_Fudge" title="Cornelius Fudge">Cornelius Fudge</a>, and Lucius come to take Hagrid to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Azkaban" title="Azkaban">Azkaban</a>, but he discreetly tells the boys to "follow the spiders". In the Forbidden Forest, Harry and Ron meet Hagrid's giant pet spider, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aragog" title="Aragog">Aragog</a>, who reveals Hagrid's innocence and provides them a small clue about the Chamber's monster.
</p><p>A book page in Hermione's hand identifies the monster as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Basilisk_(Harry_Potter)" title="Basilisk (Harry Potter)">basilisk</a>, a giant serpent that instantly kills those that make direct eye contact with it; the petrified victims only saw it indirectly. The school staff learn that Ginny was taken into the Chamber, and convince Lockhart to save her. Harry and Ron find Lockhart, exposed as a fraud, planning to flee; knowing Myrtle was the girl the Basilisk killed, they take him to the bathroom and find the Chamber's entrance. Once inside, Lockhart uses Ron's broken wand against them, but it backfires, wipes his memory, and causes a cave-in.
</p><p>Harry enters the Chamber alone and finds Ginny unconscious, guarded by Riddle. Riddle reveals that he used the diary to manipulate Ginny and reopen the Chamber. When Riddle creates the anagram for his future new identity, "I am Lord Voldemort", Harry realises that Riddle himself is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Slytherin" title="Slytherin">Slytherin</a>'s heir and Voldemort's true identity. After Harry expresses support for Dumbledore, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Magical_creatures_(Harry_Potter)#Fawkes" title="Magical creatures (Harry Potter)">Fawkes</a> flies in with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sorting_Hat" title="Sorting Hat">Sorting Hat</a>, causing Riddle to summon the Basilisk. Fawkes blinds the Basilisk, allowing Harry to look at it directly without being killed or petrified. The Sorting Hat eventually produces the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sword_of_Gryffindor" title="Sword of Gryffindor">Sword of Gryffindor</a>, with which Harry battles and slays the Basilisk, though he is injured by one of its fangs.
</p><p>Harry defeats Riddle and revives Ginny by stabbing the diary with a basilisk fang. Fawkes's tears heal him, and he returns to Hogwarts with his friends and a baffled Lockhart. Dumbledore praises them and orders Hagrid's release. Dumbledore shows Harry the sword he wielded was <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Godric_Gryffindor" title="Godric Gryffindor">Godric Gryffindor</a>'s own sword, and says he is different from Voldemort because he chose <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gryffindor" title="Gryffindor">Gryffindor</a> instead of Slytherin. Harry accuses Lucius, Dobby's master, of planting the diary in Ginny's cauldron, and tricks him into freeing Dobby. The Basilisk's victims are healed, Hermione reunites with Harry and Ron, and Hagrid is released from Azkaban. In a <a href="/wiki/Post-credits_scene" title="Post-credits scene">post-credits scene</a>, Lockhart is seen in a straitjacket, having published a new book: <i>Who Am I?</i>.

Terrified and hiding in another painting, she tells Dumbledore that Sirius has entered the castle. During a stormy <a href="/wiki/Quidditch" title="Quidditch">Quidditch</a> match against <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hufflepuff" title="Hufflepuff">Hufflepuff</a>, dementors attack Harry, causing him to fall off <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nimbus_2000" title="Nimbus 2000">his broomstick</a>. At <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hogsmeade" title="Hogsmeade">Hogsmeade</a>, Harry is shocked to learn that not only had Sirius been his father's best friend and apparently betrayed them to Voldemort, but is also Harry's godfather. Lupin privately teaches Harry to defend himself against dementors, using the Patronus Charm.
</p><p>After Harry, Ron, and Hermione witness Buckbeak's execution, Ron's pet rat <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Scabbers" title="Scabbers">Scabbers</a> bites him and escapes. When Ron gives chase, a large dog appears and drags both Ron and Scabbers into a hole at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Whomping_Willow" title="Whomping Willow">Whomping Willow</a>'s base. This leads the trio to an underground passage of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shrieking_Shack" title="Shrieking Shack">Shrieking Shack</a>, where they discover that the dog is actually Sirius, who is an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Animagus" title="Animagus">Animagus</a>. Lupin arrives and embraces Sirius as an old friend. He admits to being a werewolf, and explains that Sirius is innocent. Sirius was falsely accused of betraying the Potters to Voldemort, as well as murdering twelve Muggles and their mutual friend, <a href="/wiki/Death_Eater#Peter_Pettigrew" title="Death Eater">Peter Pettigrew</a>. It is revealed that Scabbers is actually Pettigrew, an Animagus who betrayed the Potters and committed the murders. After forcing him back into human form, Lupin and Sirius prepare to kill him, but Harry convinces them to turn Pettigrew over to the dementors.
</p><p>As the group departs, the full moon rises and Lupin transforms into a <a href="/wiki/Werewolf" title="Werewolf">werewolf</a>. Sirius transforms into his dog form to fight him off. In the midst of the chaos, Pettigrew transforms back into a rat and escapes. Harry and Sirius are attacked by dementors, and Harry sees a figure in the distance save them by casting a powerful Patronus spell. He believes the mysterious figure is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/James_Potter_(character)" title="James Potter (character)">his deceased father</a> before passing out. He awakens to discover that Sirius has been captured and sentenced to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dementor%27s_Kiss" title="Dementor's Kiss">Dementor's Kiss</a>.
</p><p>Acting on Dumbledore's advice, Harry and Hermione travel back in time with Hermione's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Time_Turner" title="Time Turner">Time Turner</a>, and watch themselves and Ron repeat the night's events. They save Buckbeak from execution and witness the Dementors overpower Harry and Sirius. The present Harry realises that it was actually him who conjured the Patronus, and does so again. Harry and Hermione rescue Sirius, who escapes with Buckbeak. Exposed as a werewolf, Lupin resigns from teaching to prevent an uproar from parents. He also returned the Marauder's Map back to Harry, given he no longer has the authority to confiscate contrabands. Sirius sends Harry a Firebolt broom, and he happily takes it for a ride.
</p><p>In 1926, 65 years before the events of the <a href="/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Philosopher%27s_Stone_(film)" title="Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone (film)">first <i>Harry Potter</i> film</a>, British wizard and "magizoologist" <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Newt_Scamander" title="Newt Scamander">Newt Scamander</a> arrives in New York, en route to <a href="/wiki/Arizona" title="Arizona">Arizona</a>. He encounters Mary Lou Barebone, a non-magical woman ("No-Maj" or "<a href="/wiki/Muggle" title="Muggle">Muggle</a>") who heads the New Salem Philanthropic Society. As Newt listens to her speaking about witches and wizards being real and dangerous, a <a href="/wiki/Magical_creatures_in_Harry_Potter#Creatures" title="Magical creatures in Harry Potter">Niffler</a> escapes from Newt's magically expanded suitcase, which houses various magical creatures. As Newt attempts to capture the Niffler, he meets No-Maj cannery worker and aspiring baker Jacob Kowalski, and they unwittingly swap suitcases. Demoted <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Magic" title="Ministry of Magic">Auror</a> (hunter of dark wizards) Tina Goldstein arrests Newt for the chaos caused by the Niffler and takes him to the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) headquarters, hoping to regain her former position. However, as Jacob's suitcase contains only baked goods, Newt is released. At Jacob's tenement apartment, several creatures escape from Newt's suitcase.
</p><p>After Tina and Newt find Jacob and the suitcase, Tina takes them to her apartment and introduces them to Queenie, her <a href="/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter#Legilimency_and_Occlumency" title="Magic in Harry Potter">Legilimens</a> sister. Jacob and Queenie are mutually attracted, though American wizards are forbidden to have any contact with No-Majs. Newt takes Jacob inside his magically expanded suitcase, where Jacob encounters a contained <a href="/wiki/Magical_creatures_in_Harry_Potter#Obscurials/Obscurus" title="Magical creatures in Harry Potter">Obscurus</a>, a parasite that develops inside magically gifted children if they suppress their magical abilities. Newt extracted it from a young girl who died, those afflicted rarely living past the age of ten. Newt persuades Jacob to help search for the missing creatures. After they re-capture two of the three escaped beasts, Tina returns the suitcase to MACUSA. Officials arrest them, believing one of Newt's beasts to be responsible for killing <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate" title="United States Senate">Senator</a> Henry Shaw, Jr. Director of Magical Security Percival Graves accuses Newt of conspiring with the infamous <a href="/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter#Dark_Arts" title="Magic in Harry Potter">dark wizard</a> <a href="/wiki/List_of_supporting_Harry_Potter_characters#Gellert_Grindelwald" title="List of supporting Harry Potter characters">Gellert Grindelwald</a>, and decides to destroy Newt's suitcase and erase Jacob's recent memories of magic. Newt and Tina are sentenced to immediate death in secret, but Queenie and Jacob rescue them, and they escape after retrieving Newt's suitcase. Following a tip from Tina's old <a href="/wiki/Goblin" title="Goblin">goblin</a> informant Gnarlack, the foursome find and re-capture the last of the escaped creatures.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Graves approaches Mary Lou's adopted son Credence and offers to free him from his abusive mother. In exchange, Graves wants Credence to find an Obscurus, which he believes has caused the mysterious destructive incidents around the city. Credence finds a <a href="/wiki/Magical_objects_in_Harry_Potter#Wand" title="Magical objects in Harry Potter">wand</a> under his adopted sister Modesty's bed. Mary Lou assumes it is Credence's wand, but Modesty says it is hers. When Modesty is about to be punished, the Obscurus kills Mary Lou and her eldest daughter Chastity. Graves arrives, and after Credence leads him to Modesty, who he assumes is the Obscurus's host, he dismisses Credence as being a <a href="/wiki/Fictional_universe_of_Harry_Potter#Squibs" title="Fictional universe of Harry Potter">Squib</a> and refuses to teach him magic as he had previously promised. Credence reveals he is the real host, having lived longer than any other host due to the intensity of his magic. In a fit of rage, Credence transforms and attacks the city.
</p><p>Newt finds Credence hiding in a subway tunnel, but he is attacked by Graves. Tina, who knows Credence, arrives and attempts to calm him, while Graves tries to convince Credence to listen to him. As Credence begins to settle back into human form, Aurors arrive and apparently disintegrate him to protect the magical society; however, a tiny Obscurus fragment escapes. Graves admits his plan of unleashing the Obscurus to expose the magical community to the No-Majs and framing Newt for it, and angrily claims that MACUSA protects the No-Majs more than themselves. As the president orders the Aurors to apprehend Graves, he attacks and begins to defeat all of them. Newt manages to subdue him with one of his beasts, and uses a revealing spell to expose Graves as Grindelwald in disguise, who is taken into custody.
</p><p>MACUSA fears their secret world has been exposed, but Newt releases his <a href="/wiki/Thunderbird_(mythology)" title="Thunderbird (mythology)">Thunderbird</a> to disperse a potion as rainfall over the city that erases all New Yorkers' recent memories, as MACUSA wizards repair the destruction. Queenie kisses Jacob goodbye as the rain erases his memories. Newt departs for Europe, but promises to return and visit Tina when his book is finished; he also anonymously leaves Jacob a case of silver <a href="/wiki/Magical_creatures_in_Harry_Potter#Occamy" title="Magical creatures in Harry Potter">Occamy</a> eggshells to fund his bakery. Jacob's breads and pastries are subconsciously inspired by Newt's creatures, and Queenie visits him in his shop.
</p><p>In 1927, the Magical Congress of the United States of America (MACUSA) is transferring the powerful <a href="/wiki/Magic_in_Harry_Potter#Dark_Arts" title="Magic in Harry Potter">dark wizard</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gellert_Grindelwald" title="Gellert Grindelwald">Gellert Grindelwald</a> to London to be tried for his crimes. Grindelwald escapes, helped by Abernathy.
</p><p>Three months later in London, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Newt_Scamander" title="Newt Scamander">Newt Scamander</a> runs into Leta Lestrange, an old <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hogwarts_School_of_Witchcraft_and_Wizardry" title="Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry">Hogwarts</a> classmate now engaged to his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Auror" title="Auror">Auror</a> brother, Theseus. The Ministry of Magic asks Newt if he will work alongside Theseus to locate Credence Barebone in Paris. Credence may be Leta's lost brother, Corvus Lestrange, the only person who can kill Hogwarts professor <a href="/wiki/Albus_Dumbledore" title="Albus Dumbledore">Albus Dumbledore</a>. Newt declines, and the Auror Grimmson is dispatched in his place. Later, Dumbledore persuades Newt to go.
</p><p>Newt's American friends, Queenie Goldstein and Jacob Kowalski, visit him unexpectedly. Jacob has retained most of his memories from the 1926 Obliviation order in New York. Queenie tells Newt that she and Jacob have followed her sister, Tina, to Europe; Tina is searching for Credence in Paris. Queenie says that Tina believes Newt is betrothed to Leta Lestrange. Newt says she confused him with Theseus. He deduces that Queenie has enchanted Jacob into eloping to circumvent MACUSA's marriage ban between wizards and <a href="/wiki/Muggle" title="Muggle">muggles</a>. After Newt lifts the charm, Jacob and Queenie quarrel about marrying, and an upset Queenie leaves to find Tina. Newt and Jacob follow to Paris.
</p><p>In Paris, Tina searches for Credence at the Circus Arcanus. Credence and a circus freak named <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nagini_(Harry_Potter)" title="Nagini (Harry Potter)">Nagini</a> escape after causing a distraction. While searching for Credence's birth mother, he and Nagini locate the servant who put him up for adoption. However, Grimmson, who is secretly working for Grindelwald, arrives and kills her. Meanwhile, Tina meets Yusuf Kama who is also hunting Credence. Newt and Jacob follow Yusuf to Tina, and Yusuf explains that he made an Unbreakable Vow to kill Credence, who he believes is his step-brother and the last of the Lestrange family.
</p><p>Newt and Tina infiltrate the French Ministry of Magic for documents that can confirm Credence's identity but the pair is discovered by Leta and Theseus. Newt and Tina reconcile after he explains he was never engaged to Leta. Their search for information about Credence leads them to the Lestrange family tomb. Yusuf says that he and Leta have the same mother, and Leta reveals that she unintentionally killed her infant brother and thus he cannot be Credence. However, a fabricated trail led Credence to the tomb, where Grindelwald is holding a rally for his followers. Jacob finds Queenie at the rally.
</p><p>At the rally, Grindelwald preaches against laws forcing wizards to be hidden from muggles, and utilizes future images of <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">World War II</a> to call for worldwide wizard supremacy and domination. Led by Theseus, Aurors surround the rally, but Grindelwald creates a diversion while sending his followers across Europe to spread his message. Grindelwald casts a circle of blue flame to divide followers from enemies. Credence and Queenie cross over to join him, while Leta sacrifices herself by attacking Grindelwald, allowing Newt, Tina, Jacob, Yusuf, Nagini, and Theseus to escape. As Grindelwald leaves, the remaining heroes unite alongside the immortal alchemist <a href="/wiki/Nicolas_Flamel" title="Nicolas Flamel">Nicolas Flamel</a> to defeat Grindelwald's blue flame. Newt now realises he must join the fight.
</p><p>At Hogwarts, Newt gives Dumbledore a vial stolen from Grindelwald. It contains the blood pact that Grindelwald and Dumbledore, once young lovers, made with one another in their youth. Newt surmises that this has prevented Dumbledore and Grindelwald from duelling each other. Dumbledore confirms this, but believes it may be possible to destroy the pact. At his Nurmengard base in Austria, Grindelwald reveals Credence's true identity as Aurelius Dumbledore, Albus' long-lost brother and the only person powerful enough to defeat him. Queenie uses her mind-reading ability to advise Grindelwald on ways to control Credence. A baby bird that Credence had been caring for is revealed to be a phoenix, a bird associated with the Dumbledore family.

Although he fails a series of physical, medical and psychological examinations, M approves his return to the field, ordering him to identify Patrice's employer, recover the stolen hard drive, and kill Patrice.

</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Shanghai" title="Shanghai">Shanghai</a>, Bond follows Patrice into a skyscraper but is unable to prevent him from killing a target. The two fight, but Patrice falls to his death before Bond can learn his employer's identity. Bond finds a <a href="/wiki/Casino_token" title="Casino token">casino token</a> that Patrice intended to cash in for the assassination, which leads him to a casino in <a href="/wiki/Macau" title="Macau">Macau</a>. There, Bond is approached by <a href="/wiki/S%C3%A9v%C3%A9rine" title="Sévérine">Sévérine</a>, Patrice's accomplice, and asks to meet her employer.

</p><p>At MI6's new underground headquarters, Q attempts to decrypt Silva's laptop, but inadvertently gives it access to the MI6 servers, which allows Silva to escape.

</p><p>A posthumous message from the <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)#Judi_Dench:_1995–2012" title="M (James Bond)">previous M</a> leads <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MI6" title="MI6">MI6</a> agent James Bond to carry out an unauthorised mission in <a href="/wiki/Mexico_City" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a> on the <a href="/wiki/Day_of_the_Dead" title="Day of the Dead">Day of the Dead</a>, where he stops a terrorist bombing plot. Bond kills Marco Sciarra, the terrorist leader, and takes his ring, which is emblazoned with a stylised octopus. 
</p><p>Upon his return to <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, Bond is suspended from field duty by Gareth Mallory, the current <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" title="M (James Bond)">M</a>, who is engaged in a power struggle with Max Denbigh (whom Bond dubs "C"), the Director-General of the new, <a href="/wiki/Private_intelligence_agency" title="Private intelligence agency">privately-backed</a> Joint Intelligence Service formed by a recent merger of <a href="/wiki/MI5" title="MI5">MI5</a> and MI6.

</p><p>Bond disobeys M's orders and travels to Rome to attend Sciarra's funeral. He seduces Sciarra's widow, Lucia, who tells him Marco belonged to an organisation of businessmen with criminal and terrorist connections. Bond uses Sciarra's ring to infiltrate a meeting to select Sciarra's replacement, where he identifies the leader, Franz Oberhauser. After hearing Oberhauser give the order for the "Pale King" to be assassinated, Bond is pursued across the city by the organisation's assassin, Mr. Hinx. <a href="/wiki/Miss_Moneypenny" title="Miss Moneypenny">Eve Moneypenny</a> informs Bond that the Pale King is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mr._White_(James_Bond)" title="Mr. White (James Bond)">Mr. White</a>, a former member of the organisation's subsidiary <a href="/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_villains#Villainous_organisations" title="List of James Bond villains">Quantum</a> who had fallen afoul of Oberhauser. Bond asks her to investigate Oberhauser, who was presumed dead years earlier.
</p><p>Bond locates White in <a href="/wiki/Altaussee" title="Altaussee">Altaussee</a>, Austria, where he is dying of <a href="/wiki/Thallium_poisoning" title="Thallium poisoning">thallium poisoning</a>. He tells Bond to find and protect his daughter, psychiatrist Dr. Madeline Swann, who will take him to L'Américain in order to locate Oberhauser; White then commits suicide. Bond confronts Swann and rescues her from Hinx and his forces. The pair meet <a href="/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)#Ben_Whishaw:_2012–" title="Q (James Bond)">Q</a>, who links Oberhauser to Bond's previous missions, identifying <a href="/wiki/Le_Chiffre" title="Le Chiffre">Le Chiffre</a>, <a href="/wiki/Quantum_of_Solace" title="Quantum of Solace">Dominic Greene</a> and <a href="/wiki/Raoul_Silva" title="Raoul Silva">Raoul Silva</a> as agents of the same organisation, which Swann identifies as <a href="/wiki/SPECTRE" title="SPECTRE">Spectre</a>.
</p><p>Swann takes Bond to L'Américain, a hotel in <a href="/wiki/Tangier" title="Tangier">Tangier</a>, and they discover that White left evidence directing them to Oberhauser's base at a crater in the <a href="/wiki/Sahara" title="Sahara">Sahara</a>. Taking a train to a remote station, Bond and Swann encounter Hinx, who gets ejected from the train in the ensuing struggle, and are escorted to Oberhauser's base. Oberhauser reveals that Spectre has funded the Joint Intelligence Service while staging terrorist attacks around the world, creating a need for the Nine Eyes programme. In return, C will give Spectre unlimited access to intelligence gathered by Nine Eyes, allowing them to anticipate and counter-act investigations into their operations. Bond is tortured as Oberhauser discusses their shared history: after the younger Bond was orphaned, Oberhauser's father, Hannes, became his temporary guardian. Believing that Bond supplanted his role as son, Oberhauser killed his father, staged his own death, adopted the name <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld" title="Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> and went on to form Spectre and target Bond. Bond and Swann stun Blofeld by setting off an explosive wristwatch at his face, and the two escape to London to prevent Nine Eyes from going online.
</p><p>In London, Bond and Swann meet M, <a href="/wiki/Bill_Tanner" title="Bill Tanner">Bill Tanner</a>, Q, and Moneypenny with the intention of arresting C. Swann and Bond are abducted separately by Spectre operatives, while the rest of the group proceed with the plan. After Q succeeds in preventing the Nine Eyes from going online, a struggle between M and C ends with C falling to his death. Bond is taken to the ruins of the old <a href="/wiki/SIS_Building" title="SIS Building">MI6 building</a>, scheduled for demolition after <a href="/wiki/Skyfall" title="Skyfall">Silva's bombing</a>. Blofeld, still alive, tells Bond that he must escape before explosives are detonated or die trying to save Swann. Bond finds Swann and they escape by boat as the building collapses. Bond shoots down Blofeld's helicopter, which crashes onto <a href="/wiki/Westminster_Bridge" title="Westminster Bridge">Westminster Bridge</a>. As Blofeld crawls from the wreckage, Bond confronts him but leaves him to be arrested by M, before leaving the bridge with Swann.
</p><p>The next morning, Bond claims his repaired Aston Martin DB5 from Q, and drives off with Swann to parts unknown.

</p><p>To recoup the money, Le Chiffre sets up a high-stakes <a href="/wiki/Texas_hold_%27em" title="Texas hold 'em">Texas hold 'em</a> tournament at the Casino Royale in <a href="/wiki/Montenegro" title="Montenegro">Montenegro</a>. MI6 enters Bond in the tournament, believing a defeat will force Le Chiffre to seek asylum with the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_government" title="British government">British government</a>, which they will grant in exchange for information on his clients. On the train to Montenegro, Bond meets <a href="/wiki/Vesper_Lynd" title="Vesper Lynd">Vesper Lynd</a>, a <a href="/wiki/HM_Treasury" title="HM Treasury">British Treasury</a> agent there to protect the government's $10 million <a href="/wiki/Buying_in_(poker)" title="Buying in (poker)">buy-in</a>. In Montenegro, they meet their MI6 contact, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ren%C3%A9_Mathis" title="René Mathis">René Mathis</a>.
</p><p>At the start of the game, Bond gains the upper hand by deducing Le Chiffre's <a href="/wiki/Tell_(poker)" title="Tell (poker)">tell</a>. During a break, Obanno, enraged by the loss of his funds, ambushes Le Chiffre in his suite. Strangling the banker with a cord and threatening to amputate his girlfriend <a href="/wiki/List_of_henchmen_of_James_Bond_villains#Casino_Royale" title="List of henchmen of James Bond villains">Valenka</a>'s arm with a <a href="/wiki/Machete" title="Machete">machete</a>, the warlord allows Le Chiffre to continue with his plan to win back the money. As Obanno leaves, his bodyguard spots Bond and shoots at him. Bond throws the minion over a stair railing; then he and Obanno engage in a savage brawl in the stairwell, ending with Bond disarming Obanno and throttling him to death. Vesper is traumatised by the encounter, but Bond comforts her. When the tournament resumes, Bond loses his initial <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Poker_staking" title="Poker staking">stake</a> due to Le Chiffre being tipped off to the tell, and Vesper refuses to fund further playing. Frustrated, Bond is about to kill Le Chiffre when he meets <a href="/wiki/Felix_Leiter" title="Felix Leiter">Felix Leiter</a>, a fellow player and <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</a> agent who agrees to stake Bond to continue playing in exchange for allowing Le Chiffre to be taken into American custody.

</p><p>Bond and Vesper share a celebratory dinner until Vesper is kidnapped by a vengeful Le Chiffre. Bond pursues them in his Aston Martin but sees Vesper tied up and lying in the middle of the road, swerves violently to avoid her, crashes, and is taken captive. Le Chiffre brings Bond and Vesper to an abandoned ship and separates them. He tortures Bond by tearing off his clothes, seating him in a chair with no seat and whipping his genitals with a knotted rope, demanding the password to the account containing the winnings. Bond refuses to give in. As Le Chiffre prepares to <a href="/wiki/Castration" title="Castration">castrate</a> Bond, Mr. White enters and shoots Le Chiffre in the head, killing him. Bond awakens in an MI6 hospital; he provides Vesper with the password and has Mathis arrested as the traitor.
</p><p>Bond decides to resign from MI6, and he and Vesper run away together to <a href="/wiki/Venice" title="Venice">Venice</a>, engaging in a passionate love affair. When M calls Bond to tell him the money was never deposited, Bond finally realizes it was Vesper who betrayed him. He follows her to a handoff of the money, where a firefight erupts. The building's flotation system is damaged in the struggle and, as it begins to sink into the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Canal_(Venice)" title="Grand Canal (Venice)">Grand Canal</a>, Vesper is forced into an elevator. Bond kills Vesper's handlers and attempts to save her, but she locks herself inside, kisses his hands to symbolically cleanse him of guilt, and opens her mouth to drown. Bond frees Vesper and escapes the building. After a futile attempt to <a href="/wiki/Resuscitation" title="Resuscitation">resuscitate</a> her, he tenderly cradles her corpse. White, watching nearby, walks away with the money.
</p><p>M informs Bond that <a href="/wiki/SPECTRE#rebooted_community" title="SPECTRE">the organisation behind Le Chiffre</a> had kidnapped Vesper's lover and threatened to kill him unless she became a <a href="/wiki/Double_agent" title="Double agent">double agent</a>, and that she likely made a deal with them the night of their capture: the money to save Bond's life. Bond coldly renounces Vesper as a traitor and tells M he'll return to service, just before he discovers a final text message left for him by Vesper.
</p><p>At an estate in <a href="/wiki/Lake_Como" title="Lake Como">Lake Como</a>, Mr. White receives a phone call. As he asks for the caller's identity, he is shot in the leg, and the caller walks up and introduces himself: "The name's Bond… James Bond."

M's <a href="/wiki/Bodyguard" title="Bodyguard">bodyguard</a>, Craig Mitchell (Glenn Foster), is a double agent and he attacks M, enabling White to escape. Bond chases Mitchell and kills him. Bond and M return to London and search Mitchell's flat, discovering Mitchell had a contact in <a href="/wiki/Haiti" title="Haiti">Haiti</a>, Edmund Slate (<a href="/wiki/Neil_Jackson" title="Neil Jackson">Neil Jackson</a>).

Bond infiltrates Quantum's meeting at the opera, identifying members of Quantum's executive board, and a gunfight ensues. A <a href="/wiki/Counter_Terrorism_Command" title="Counter Terrorism Command">Special Branch</a> bodyguard working for Quantum member Guy Haines (<a href="/wiki/Paul_Ritter_(actor)" title="Paul Ritter (actor)">Paul Ritter</a>), is killed by one of Greene's men after Bond throws him off a roof. M assumes Bond killed him, and has Bond's passports and credit cards revoked. Bond heads to Italy and convinces his old ally <a href="/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_allies#René_Mathis" title="List of James Bond allies">René Mathis</a> (<a href="/wiki/Giancarlo_Giannini" title="Giancarlo Giannini">Giancarlo Giannini</a>) to accompany him to Bolivia. They are greeted by Strawberry Fields (<a href="/wiki/Gemma_Arterton" title="Gemma Arterton">Gemma Arterton</a>), a consular employee who demands Bond return to the UK immediately. Bond seduces her and they attend a fundraising party Greene holds that night. At the party, Bond again rescues Camille from Greene. Leaving, Bond and Camille are pulled over by Bolivian police working for Medrano. They had earlier attacked Mathis and put his body in Bond's car to frame Bond. In the ensuing struggle, Mathis and the cops are killed.
</p><p>The following day, Bond and Camille survey Quantum's intended land acquisition by air; their plane is shot down by a Bolivian fighter aircraft. They skydive into a sinkhole, and discover Quantum is damming Bolivia's supply of fresh water to create a <a href="/wiki/Monopoly" title="Monopoly">monopoly</a>. Back in La Paz, Bond meets M and learns Quantum killed Fields by drowning her in <a href="/wiki/Petroleum" title="Petroleum">crude oil</a>. Bond meets CIA Agent <a href="/wiki/Felix_Leiter" title="Felix Leiter">Felix Leiter</a> (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jeffrey_Wright_(actor)" title="Jeffrey Wright (actor)">Jeffrey Wright</a>), who discloses Greene and Medrano will meet in the <a href="/wiki/Atacama_Desert" title="Atacama Desert">Atacama Desert</a> to finalise their agreement.

</p><p>At an <a href="/wiki/Eco_hotel" title="Eco hotel">eco hotel</a> in the desert, Greene tells Medrano that now he controls the majority of Bolivia's water supply, Medrano must accept a new contract that makes Greene Planet Bolivia's sole water <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Utility_company" title="Utility company">utility company</a> at significantly higher rates. Bond infiltrates the complex, kills the chief of police (<a href="/wiki/Fernando_Guill%C3%A9n_Cuervo" title="Fernando Guillén Cuervo">Fernando Guillén Cuervo</a>) for betraying Mathis, and single-handedly assaults the hotel. After killing the security detail, he confronts Greene. Meanwhile, Camille kills Medrano, avenging the murders of her family. The struggle leaves the hotel destroyed by fire. Bond captures Greene and interrogates him about Quantum, leaving him stranded in the desert with only a can of engine oil, wondering if Greene will get thirsty enough to drink it.
</p><p>Bond travels to <a href="/wiki/Kazan" title="Kazan">Kazan</a>, Russia, where he finds <a href="/wiki/Vesper_Lynd" title="Vesper Lynd">Vesper Lynd</a>'s former lover, Yusef Kabira (<a href="/wiki/Simon_Kassianides" title="Simon Kassianides">Simon Kassianides</a>), a member of Quantum who seduces women with valuable connections, and who is indirectly responsible for her death.

He allows MI6 to arrest Kabira. Outside, M tells Bond that Greene was found dead in the middle of the desert, shot twice and with engine oil in his stomach. M tells Bond she needs him back; he responds that he never left. Walking away, he drops Vesper's necklace in the snow.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service" title="Secret Intelligence Service">MI6</a> agent James Bond infiltrates a <a href="/wiki/North_Korea" title="North Korea">North Korean</a> military base, where Colonel Tan-Sun Moon is illegally trading weapons for African <a href="/wiki/Blood_diamond" title="Blood diamond">conflict diamonds</a>. After Moon's assistant Zao discovers that Bond is a British agent via an unknown source, Moon attempts to kill Bond and a <a href="/wiki/Hovercraft" title="Hovercraft">hovercraft</a> chase ensues, ending with Moon's death. Bond survives, but is captured by North Korean soldiers and imprisoned by the Colonel's father, General Moon.

Bond is convinced that he has been set up by a <a href="/wiki/Double_agent" title="Double agent">double agent</a> in the British government and decides to avenge his betrayal.  After escaping from the custody of MI6, he discovers that he is in <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, where he learns from a Chinese agent that Zao is in <a href="/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Havana" title="Havana">Havana</a>, Bond meets <a href="/wiki/National_Security_Agency" title="National Security Agency">NSA</a> agent Giacinta 'Jinx' Johnson, with whom he is intimate. Later, Bond follows her to a <a href="/wiki/Gene_therapy" title="Gene therapy">gene therapy</a> clinic, where patients can have their appearances altered through DNA restructuring. Bond locates Zao inside the clinic and attempts to kill him, but he escapes, leaving behind a pendant which leads Bond to a cache of diamonds, identified as conflict diamonds, but bearing the crest of the company owned by British billionaire businessman Gustav Graves. Bond learns that Graves only appeared a year prior, apparently discovering a vein of diamonds in Iceland leading to his current wealth, celebrity, and philanthropy from its assets.
</p><p>At <a href="/wiki/Blades_Club" title="Blades Club">Blades Club</a> in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, Bond meets Graves along with his assistant <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_henchmen_in_Die_Another_Day#Miranda_Frost" title="List of James Bond henchmen in Die Another Day">Miranda Frost</a>, who is also an undercover MI6 agent. After a <a href="/wiki/Fencing" title="Fencing">fencing</a> exercise (and a literal sword-fight), Bond is invited by Graves to <a href="/wiki/Iceland" title="Iceland">Iceland</a> for a scientific demonstration. Shortly afterwards, M tells Bond of MI6's doubts about Graves, restores Bond's Double-0 status and offers assistance in the investigation.
</p><p>At his <a href="/wiki/Ice_palace" title="Ice palace">ice palace</a> adjacent to the diamond mine site in Iceland, Graves unveils a new orbital mirror satellite, "Icarus", which is able to focus <a href="/wiki/Solar_energy" title="Solar energy">solar energy</a> on a small area and provide year-round sunshine for crop development.  During the night, Jinx infiltrates Graves' command centre, but is captured by Graves and Zao.  Bond rescues her and later discovers that Colonel Moon is still alive.  Moon has used the gene therapy technology to change his appearance, creating the identity of Gustav Graves and amassing his fortune from sale of the conflict diamonds.
</p><p>Bond confronts Graves, but Frost arrives to reveal herself as the traitor who betrayed Bond in North Korea, forcing Bond to escape from Graves' facility. Bond then returns in his <a href="/wiki/Aston_Martin_Vanquish" title="Aston Martin Vanquish">Aston Martin Vanquish</a> to rescue Jinx, who has been captured once again within the palace. As Graves uses Icarus to melt the ice palace, Zao pursues Bond into the palace using his <a href="/wiki/Jaguar_XK_(X100)" title="Jaguar XK (X100)">Jaguar XKR</a>. Bond kills Zao by causing a giant ice chandelier to fall onto him, and then revives Jinx after she has almost drowned.
</p><p>Bond and Jinx pursue Graves and Frost to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Korean_peninsula" title="Korean peninsula">Korean peninsula</a> and stow away on Graves' cargo plane. Graves reveals his true identity to his father, and the true purpose of the Icarus satellite: to cut a path through the <a href="/wiki/Korean_Demilitarized_Zone" title="Korean Demilitarized Zone">Korean Demilitarized Zone</a> with concentrated sunlight, allowing North Korean troops to invade <a href="/wiki/South_Korea" title="South Korea">South Korea</a> and reunite the peninsula by force. Horrified at the fact that it would result in a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_warfare" title="Nuclear warfare">nuclear war</a> with the United States, General Moon tries to turn the plan down, but he is murdered by his own son.
</p><p>Bond attempts to shoot Graves, but he is prevented by one of the soldiers on board.  In their struggle, a gunshot pierces the <a href="/wiki/Fuselage" title="Fuselage">fuselage</a>, causing the plane to descend rapidly.  Bond and Graves engage in a fist fight, and Jinx attempts to regain control of the plane.  Frost attacks Jinx, forcing her to defend herself in a sword duel. After the plane passes through the Icarus beam and is further damaged, Jinx kills Frost. Graves attempts to escape by parachute, but Bond opens the parachute, causing Graves to be pulled out of the plane and into one of its engines, killing him and disabling the Icarus beam. Bond and Jinx then escape from the disintegrating plane in a helicopter from the cargo hold, carrying away Graves' stash of diamonds in the process. In the end, they are seen to have sex amidst the diamonds on a bed in a South Korean Buddhist temple located in a valley.

Bond also wants the name of the killer of a fellow MI6 agent, but the banker is killed by his assistant before he can reveal it. Bond escapes from the banker's office with the money, but it is revealed to be booby-trapped; Sir Robert is killed by an explosion inside MI6 headquarters in <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>.

Following an earlier attempt on his life by MI6 agent 009, Renard was left with a bullet in his brain, which is gradually destroying his senses, making him immune to pain until he dies. M assigns Bond to protect King's daughter Elektra against Renard, who had previously abducted her. Bond flies to <a href="/wiki/Azerbaijan" title="Azerbaijan">Azerbaijan</a>, where Elektra is overseeing the construction of her family's oil pipeline.

</p><p>Bond visits <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_allies_in_GoldenEye#Valentin_Dmitrovich_Zukovsky" title="List of James Bond allies in GoldenEye">Valentin Zukovsky</a> at his Baku <a href="/wiki/Casino" title="Casino">casino</a> to acquire information about Elektra's attackers; he deduces that Elektra's head of security, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_henchmen_in_The_World_Is_Not_Enough#Sasha_Davidov" title="List of James Bond henchmen in The World Is Not Enough">Davidov</a>, is secretly in league with Renard. Bond kills Davidov and takes his place on a plane bound for a Russian <a href="/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile" title="Intercontinental ballistic missile">ICBM</a> base in <a href="/wiki/Kazakhstan" title="Kazakhstan">Kazakhstan</a>. He poses as a Russian nuclear scientist and meets American <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_physics" title="Nuclear physics">nuclear physicist</a> Christmas Jones, before entering the silo. Inside, Renard is removing the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/GPS" title="GPS">GPS</a> locator card and weapons-grade <a href="/wiki/Plutonium" title="Plutonium">plutonium</a> from a nuclear bomb. Before Bond can kill him, Jones blows his cover. Renard drops a hint that Elektra and he are collaborating and flees with the plutonium, while Bond and Jones escape the exploding silo with the locator card.
</p><p>Back in Azerbaijan, Bond discloses to M that <a href="/wiki/Stockholm_syndrome" title="Stockholm syndrome">Elektra may not be as innocent</a> as she seems, before they discover the stolen bomb from Kazakhstan is attached to an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pipeline_inspection_gauge" title="Pipeline inspection gauge">inspection rig</a> heading towards the oil terminal. Bond and Jones enter the pipeline to deactivate the bomb, and Jones discovers that half of the plutonium is missing. They both jump clear of the rig before a large section of pipeline is destroyed, and they are presumed killed. Back at the command centre, Elektra reveals  Renard and she are conspirators and that she killed her father as revenge for using her as bait for Renard. She abducts M, whom she resents for advising her father not to pay the ransom money, and imprisons her in the <a href="/wiki/Maiden%27s_Tower" title="Maiden's Tower">Maiden's Tower</a>.
</p><p>Bond accosts Zukovsky at his <a href="/wiki/Caviar" title="Caviar">caviar</a> factory in the <a href="/wiki/Caspian_Sea" title="Caspian Sea">Caspian Sea</a> for information on Elektra, having deduced Elektra's culpability himself, and is then attacked by Elektra's sawing helicopters. Zukovsky reveals his arrangement with Elektra was in exchange for the use of a <a href="/wiki/Submarine" title="Submarine">submarine</a>, currently being captained by Zukovsky's nephew, Nikolai. The group goes to Istanbul, where Jones realises that if Renard were to insert the stolen plutonium into the <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_submarine" title="Nuclear submarine">submarine's nuclear reactor</a>, the resulting <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_explosion" title="Nuclear explosion">nuclear explosion</a> would destroy Istanbul, sabotaging the Russians' oil pipeline in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bosphorus" title="Bosphorus">Bosphorus</a> and leaving Elektra's uncontested. Bond then receives a signal from the locator card M has activated using a clock battery, just before Zukovsky's underling, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_henchmen_in_The_World_Is_Not_Enough#Bullion" title="List of James Bond henchmen in The World Is Not Enough">Bullion</a> blows up the command centre. Bond and Jones are captured by Elektra's henchmen. Jones is taken aboard the submarine. Bond is taken to the tower, where Elektra tortures him with a <a href="/wiki/Garrote" title="Garrote">garrote</a>. Zukovsky and his men arrive and seize the tower, but Zukovsky is shot by Elektra; though dying, he frees Bond with his <a href="/wiki/Cane_gun" title="Cane gun">cane gun</a>. Bond frees M and kills Elektra, before diving after the submarine.
</p><p>Bond boards the submarine and frees Jones. Following a firefight with the crew, the submarine hits the bottom of the Bosphorus, causing its hull to rupture. Bond catches up with Renard and kills him in the submarine's reactor room by impaling him with the plutonium rod. Bond and Jones escape from the submarine via the torpedo launcher, leaving the flooded reactor to detonate safely underwater.
</p><p>As MI6 try to locate Bond by satellite surveillance,  Jones and he celebrate in Turkey.

Onatopp crushes Admiral Farrel to death with her thighs during sex. Ourumov, who is also working with Janus, steals Admiral Farrel's credentials and uses them to board a <a href="/wiki/French_Navy" title="French Navy">French Navy</a> destroyer with Onatopp where they steal a <a href="/wiki/Eurocopter_Tiger" title="Eurocopter Tiger">Eurocopter Tiger</a> helicopter. Ourumov and Onatopp fly the helicopter to a bunker in Severnaya, <a href="/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a>, where they massacre the staff and steal the control disk for the GoldenEye satellites, two Soviet <a href="/wiki/Directed-energy_weapon" title="Directed-energy weapon">electromagnetic pulse weapons</a> from the <a href="/wiki/Cold_War" title="Cold War">Cold War</a>. They program the first GoldenEye (<i>Petya</i>) to destroy the complex and disable incoming <a href="/wiki/Russian_Air_Force" title="Russian Air Force">Russian Air Force</a> fighters, and escape with kidnapped computer programmer Boris Grishenko. Natalya Simonova, the lone survivor, contacts Grishenko and arranges to meet him in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/St._Petersburg" title="St. Petersburg">St. Petersburg</a>, where he betrays her to Janus.
</p><p>In London, <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" title="M (James Bond)">M</a> assigns Bond to investigate the attack. He flies to St. Petersburg to meet <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CIA" title="CIA">CIA</a> operative Jack Wade, who suggests that Bond meet with Valentin Zukovsky, a former <a href="/wiki/KGB" title="KGB">KGB</a> agent-turned-gangster and business rival of Janus. Zukovsky arranges a meeting between Bond and Janus. Onatopp surprises Bond at the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Hotel_Europe" title="Grand Hotel Europe">Grand Hotel Europe</a> and attempts to seduce and kill him, but he overpowers her. She takes him to Janus, who reveals himself as Trevelyan; he and Ourumov had faked the death at Arkhangelsk, though he was badly scarred by the explosion. A descendant of the <a href="/wiki/Cossacks" title="Cossacks">Cossack</a> clans who <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Collaboration_with_the_Axis_Powers_during_World_War_II" title="Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II">collaborated with the Axis Powers</a>, Trevelyan had vowed revenge after the British <a href="/wiki/Repatriation_of_Cossacks_after_World_War_II" title="Repatriation of Cossacks after World War II">betrayed his people</a>, which led to his parents' suicide. Just as Bond is about to shoot Trevelyan, Bond is shot with a tranquilizer dart.
</p><p>Bond awakens, tied up with Natalya in the helicopter, which has been programmed to self-destruct. They escape but are captured and transported to the Russian military archives, where <a href="/wiki/Ministry_of_Defence_(Russia)" title="Ministry of Defence (Russia)">Minister of Defence</a> Dimitri Mishkin interrogates them. Just as Natalya reveals the existence of a second satellite and Ourumov's involvement in the Siberian massacre, Ourumov arrives and kills Mishkin. Intending to frame Bond for the murder, he calls the guards, but Bond and Natalya escape. In the ensuing firefight, Natalya is captured. Bond steals a tank and pursues Ourumov through the streets of St. Petersburg to Trevelyan's missile train, where he kills Ourumov. Trevelyan escapes and locks Bond in the train with Natalya, setting it to self-destruct. As Bond cuts through the floor with his laser watch, Natalya triangulates Grishenko's satellite dish to <a href="/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>. They escape just before the train explodes.
</p><p>Bond and Natalya meet Wade in the <a href="/wiki/Florida_Keys" title="Florida Keys">Florida Keys</a> and borrow his plane for the trip to Cuba, where they make love. They search for GoldenEye's satellite dish the next day, and are shot down in the jungle. Onatopp rappels from a helicopter and attacks Bond. After a fight ensues, he shoots the helicopter pilot, sending the vehicle into a spin which snares Onatopp between tree trunks and crushes her to death. Bond and Natalya watch water draining out of a lake, uncovering the satellite dish. They infiltrate the control station, and Bond is captured. Trevelyan reveals his plan to rob the <a href="/wiki/Bank_of_England" title="Bank of England">Bank of England</a> before erasing all of its financial records with the second GoldenEye (<i>Misha</i>), concealing the theft and destroying Britain's economy.
</p><p>Natalya programs the satellite to initiate <a href="/wiki/Atmospheric_entry" title="Atmospheric entry">atmospheric re-entry</a> and destroy itself. As Trevelyan captures Natalya and orders Grishenko to save the satellite, Grishenko unwittingly triggers an explosion with Bond's pen grenade (a gadget received earlier from <a href="/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)" title="Q (James Bond)">Q</a>), which allows Bond to escape to the antenna cradle. He sabotages the antenna to create a <a href="/wiki/System" title="System">System</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mechanical_overload_(engineering)" title="Mechanical overload (engineering)">Overload</a>, preventing Grishenko from regaining control of the satellite and then settle the score with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/006" title="006">006</a>. Bond and Trevelyan fight on the antenna's suspended platform, which finishes with Bond holding a dangling Trevelyan by his foot. Bond releases Trevelyan, who plummets into the dish. Seconds later the cradle explodes, killing Trevelyan and Grishenko. Natalya commandeers a helicopter and rescues Bond. It drops them in a field, where they are rescued by Wade and a team of <a href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps_Force_Reconnaissance" title="United States Marine Corps Force Reconnaissance">U.S. Marines</a>.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service" title="Secret Intelligence Service">MI6</a> sends <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/James_Bond_filmography" title="James Bond filmography">James Bond</a>, agent 007, into the field to spy on a terrorist arms bazaar on the Russian border. Despite <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" title="M (James Bond)">M</a>'s insistence on letting 007 finish his reconnaissance, British Admiral Roebuck orders the frigate HMS <i>Chester</i> to fire a missile at the bazaar. Bond then discovers two nuclear torpedoes mounted on an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/L-39_Albatros" title="L-39 Albatros">L-39 Albatros</a>, and is forced to pilot the L-39 away seconds before the bazaar is destroyed.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Media_proprietor" title="Media proprietor">Media baron</a> Elliot Carver begins his plans to use an encoder obtained at the bazaar by his henchman, <a href="/wiki/Cyberterrorism" title="Cyberterrorism">cyberterrorist</a> Henry Gupta, to provoke war between China and the UK. <a href="/wiki/Meaconing" title="Meaconing">Meaconing</a> the GPS signal using the encoder, Gupta sends the frigate HMS <i>Devonshire</i> off-course into Chinese-held waters in the <a href="/wiki/South_China_Sea" title="South China Sea">South China Sea</a>, where Carver's <a href="/wiki/Stealth_ship" title="Stealth ship">stealth ship</a>, commanded by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_henchmen_in_Tomorrow_Never_Dies#Mr._Stamper" title="List of James Bond henchmen in Tomorrow Never Dies">Mr. Stamper</a>, sinks it and steals one of its missiles, while shooting down a Chinese <a href="/wiki/Chengdu_J-7" title="Chengdu J-7">J-7 fighter jet</a> and killing off the <i>Devonshire</i>'s survivors with Chinese weaponry. The British <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Minister_of_Defence" title="Minister of Defence">Minister of Defence</a> orders Roebuck to deploy the fleet to recover the frigate, and possibly retaliate, leaving M only 48 hours to investigate its sinking and avert a war.
</p><p>M sends Bond to investigate Carver after he releases news articles about the crisis hours before MI6 had learned of it. Bond travels to <a href="/wiki/Hamburg" title="Hamburg">Hamburg</a> to seduce Carver's wife, Paris, who is also Bond's ex-girlfriend, to get information that would help him enter Carver's newspaper headquarters. He defeats three of Stamper's men, cuts Carver off the air during the inaugural broadcast of his satellite network, and recovers the GPS encoder; Carver orders Paris and Bond killed. Carver's assassin Dr. Kaufman kills Paris, but Bond kills Kaufman and escapes, protecting the encoder.
</p><p>At a <a href="/wiki/United_States_Air_Force" title="United States Air Force">U.S. Air Force</a> base in <a href="/wiki/Okinawa_Prefecture" title="Okinawa Prefecture">Okinawa</a>, Bond learns that the encoder had been tampered with, and goes to the South China Sea to investigate the wreck (which was actually in Vietnamese waters). He and <a href="/wiki/Wai_Lin" title="Wai Lin">Wai Lin</a>, a Chinese agent on the same case, explore the sunken ship and discover one of its cruise missiles missing, but are captured by Stamper and taken to the CMGN tower in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Saigon" title="Saigon">Saigon</a>. They soon escape and decide to collaborate on the investigation. The two contact the Royal Navy and the <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Liberation_Army_Air_Force" title="People's Liberation Army Air Force">People's Liberation Army Air Force</a> to explain Carver's scheme; Carver plans to destroy the Chinese government with the stolen missile, allowing a Chinese general to step in and stop war between Britain and China, although not before both sides attack each other at sea; once the war is over, Carver will be given exclusive broadcasting rights in China for the next century. Finding Carver's stealth ship, they board it to prevent him from firing the missile at Beijing.
</p><p>During the attempt, Wai Lin is captured, forcing Bond to devise a second plan. Bond captures Gupta to use as his own hostage, but Carver kills Gupta, claiming he has "outlived his contract." Bond detonates an explosive which damages the ship, rendering it visible to the Chinese and British navies' radars, and vulnerable to a subsequent Royal Navy attack. While Wai Lin disables the engines, she is recaptured by Stamper. Bond kills Carver with his own sea drill and attempts to destroy the warhead with detonators, but Stamper attacks him, sending a chained Wai Lin into the water. Bond traps Stamper in the missile firing mechanism and saves Wai Lin as the missile explodes, destroying the ship and killing Stamper. Bond and Wai Lin share a romantic moment amidst the wreckage as HMS <i>Bedford</i> searches for them.

</p><p>At the Drax Industries shuttle-manufacturing complex in California, Bond meets the owner of the company, Hugo Drax, and his henchman Chang. Bond also meets Dr. Holly Goodhead, an astronaut, and he then survives an assassination attempt while inside a <a href="/wiki/High-G_training" title="High-G training">centrifuge chamber</a>. Drax's personal pilot, Corinne Dufour, helps Bond find blueprints for a glass vial made in Venice; Drax discovers her involvement and has her killed by his pet dogs. 
</p><p>Bond again encounters Goodhead in Venice and observes her snooping around a door near the glass factory. Then he is chased through the canals by Drax's henchmen. He returns to the factory at night to check the door out, and discovers a secret biological laboratory, and learns that the glass vials are to hold a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nerve_gas" title="Nerve gas">nerve gas</a> deadly to humans, but harmless to animals. Chang attacks Bond, but Bond hurls him through the stained glass clockface of the Saint Mark's clocktower, killing him; during the fight, Bond finds evidence that Drax is moving his operation to Rio de Janeiro. Rejoining Goodhead, he deduces that she is a <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</a> agent spying on Drax. Bond has saved one of the vials he found earlier, as the only evidence of the now-empty laboratory; he gives it to M for analysis, who permits him to go to Rio de Janeiro under the pretence of being on leave.

Bond travels the <a href="/wiki/Amazon_River" title="Amazon River">Amazon River</a> and comes under attack from Drax's forces, before eventually locating his base. Captured by Jaws, Bond is taken to Drax and witnesses four Moonrakers lifting off. Drax explains that he stole back the loaned shuttle because another in his fleet had developed a fault during assembly. Bond and Goodhead escape and pose as pilots on <i>Moonraker 6</i>.

Jaws captures Bond and Goodhead, to whom Drax reveals his plan to destroy human life by launching 50 globes that would dispense the nerve gas into Earth's atmosphere. Drax had transported several dozen genetically perfect young men and women of varying races to the space station in the shuttles. They would live there until Earth was safe again for human life; their descendants would be the seed for a "new master race". Bond persuades Jaws to switch his allegiance by getting Drax to admit that anyone not measuring up to his physical standards, including Dolly, would be exterminated. Jaws attacks Drax's guards, and a laser battle ensues between Drax's forces and Bond, Jaws, and the Marines. Drax's forces are defeated as the station is destroyed, while Bond shoots and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Space_exposure" title="Space exposure">ejects Drax into space</a>. Bond and Goodhead use Drax's laser-armed <i>Moonraker 5</i> to destroy the three launched globes and return to Earth.

A marine archaeologist, Sir Timothy Havelock, who had been asked by the British to secretly locate the <i>St Georges</i>, prepares to send his report in, but before the task is completed, Havelock is killed with his wife Iona by a Cuban hitman, Hector Gonzales. Bond goes to Spain to find out who hired Gonzales.
</p><p>While spying on Gonzales at his <a href="/wiki/Villa" title="Villa">villa</a>, Bond is captured, but manages to escape as Gonzales is killed by a crossbow bolt while diving into his swimming pool. Within the grounds, he finds the assassin was <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Judy_Havelock" title="Judy Havelock">Melina Havelock</a>, the daughter of Sir Timothy, and the pair escape. With the help of Bond, <a href="/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)" title="Q (James Bond)">Q</a> uses computerized technology to identify the man Bond saw paying off Gonzales as Emile Leopold Locque, a former enforcer in the Brussels underworld. Bond thus goes to Locque's possible base in <a href="/wiki/Cortina_d%27Ampezzo" title="Cortina d'Ampezzo">Cortina</a>, Italy. There, Bond meets his contact, Luigi Ferrara, and Aris Kristatos, a well-connected Greek businessman, shipping tycoon, and intelligence informant. Kristatos informs Bond that Locque is employed by Milos Columbo, known as "the Dove" in the Greek underworld and Kristatos' former resistance partner during the <a href="/wiki/World_War_II" title="World War II">Second World War</a>. After Bond goes with Kristatos' <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Prot%C3%A9g%C3%A9e" title="Protégée">protégée</a>, <a href="/wiki/Figure_skating" title="Figure skating">figure skater</a> Bibi Dahl, to a <a href="/wiki/Biathlon" title="Biathlon">biathlon</a> course, a group of men, which includes East German biathlete Eric Kriegler, chases Bond, trying to kill him. Bond escapes and then goes with Ferrara to bid Bibi farewell at an ice rink, where he fends off another attempt on his life by hoods in ice hockey gear. During the fight, Ferrara is killed in Bond's car, with a dove pin in his hand. Bond thus travels to <a href="/wiki/Corfu" title="Corfu">Corfu</a> in pursuit of Columbo.
</p><p>At a casino, Bond meets Kristatos and asks how to meet Columbo, not knowing that Columbo's men are secretly recording their conversation. After Columbo and his mistress, Countess Lisl von Schlaf, argue, Bond offers to escort her home with Kristatos' car and driver. The two then spend the night together. In the morning Lisl and Bond are ambushed by Locque and Lisl is killed. Bond is captured by Columbo's men before Locque can kill him; Columbo then tells Bond that Locque was actually hired by Kristatos, who is working for the KGB to retrieve the ATAC. Bond accompanies Columbo and his crew on a raid on one of Kristatos' <a href="/wiki/Opium" title="Opium">opium</a>-processing warehouses in <a href="/wiki/Albania" title="Albania">Albania</a>, where Bond uncovers naval mines similar to the one that sank the <i>St Georges</i>, suggesting that it was not an accident. When the base is destroyed, Bond chases Locque and pushes his car off a cliff, killing Locque in the process.
</p><p>Afterwards, Bond meets Melina again, and they recover the ATAC from the wreckage of the <i>St Georges</i>, but Kristatos is waiting for them when they surface and he takes the ATAC. After getting dragged over a coral reef in shark-infested waters and surviving the ordeal, they discover Kristatos' <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/rendezvous" title="wikt:rendezvous">rendezvous</a> point when Melina's parrot repeats the phrase "ATAC to St Cyril's". With the help of Columbo and his men, Bond and Melina rock climb in order to break into St Cyril's, an abandoned mountaintop monastery. As Columbo is confronting Kristatos, Bond fights Kriegler and uses a spiked candelabra to force Kriegler headlong through a window, resulting in a deadly plummet off the mountain.
</p><p>Bond retrieves the ATAC system and prevents Melina from killing Kristatos after he surrenders. Kristatos tries to kill Bond with a hidden <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Flick_knife" title="Flick knife">flick knife</a>, but Columbo kills him with a thrown knife.  Gogol arrives by helicopter to collect the ATAC, but Bond throws it off the cliff.

James Bond — <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MI6" title="MI6">MI6</a> agent 007 — is summoned to investigate. On the way to his briefing, Bond escapes an ambush by a squad of Soviet agents in <a href="/wiki/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a>, killing one during a downhill ski chase and evading the others. The plans for a highly advanced submarine tracking system are being offered in <a href="/wiki/Egypt" title="Egypt">Egypt</a>.

They travel across Egypt together, encountering <a href="/wiki/Jaws_(James_Bond)" title="Jaws (James Bond)">Jaws</a> – a tall assassin with razor-sharp steel teeth – along the way. Bond and Amasova reluctantly join forces after a truce is agreed by their respective British and Soviet superiors.

</p><p>While travelling by train to Stromberg's base in <a href="/wiki/Sardinia" title="Sardinia">Sardinia</a>, Bond saves Amasova from Jaws, and their cooling rivalry turns to affection. Posing as a <a href="/wiki/Oceanography" title="Oceanography">marine biologist</a> and his wife, they visit Stromberg's base and discover that he has launched a mysterious new supertanker, the <i>Liparus</i>, nine months previously. As they leave the base, a henchman on a motorcycle featuring a rocket sidecar, Jaws in a car, and Naomi, an assistant/pilot of Stromberg in an attack helicopter, chase them, but Bond and Amasova escape underwater when his car – a <a href="/wiki/Lotus_Esprit" title="Lotus Esprit">Lotus Esprit</a> from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Q_Branch" title="Q Branch">Q Branch</a> – converts into a submarine.

While examining Stromberg's underwater <i>Atlantis</i> base, the pair confirm that he is operating the stolen tracking system and encounter a fleet of Stromberg's minisubs which Amasova obliterates by launching mines. Bond finds out that the <i>Liparus</i> has never visited any known port or harbor. Amasova discovers that Bond killed her lover Sergi Barsov (as shown at the beginning of the movie), and she vows to kill Bond as soon as their mission is complete.
</p><p>Bond and Amasova board an <a href="/wiki/SSN_(hull_classification_symbol)" title="SSN (hull classification symbol)">American submarine</a> to examine the <i>Liparus</i> as it captures the submarine. Stromberg sets his plan in motion: the simultaneous launching of nuclear missiles from British and Soviet submarines to obilterate Moscow and New York City. This would trigger a global nuclear war, which Stromberg would survive in <i>Atlantis</i>, and subsequently a new civilisation would be established underwater. He leaves for <i>Atlantis</i> with Amasova. Bond escapes and frees the captured British, Russian and American sailors and they battle the <i>Liparus</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s crew. Bond reprograms the submarines to fire missiles at each other, saving Moscow and New York City. The victorious submariners escape the sinking <i>Liparus</i> on the American submarine.
</p><p>The submarine is ordered to destroy <i>Atlantis</i> but Bond insists on rescuing Amasova first. He confronts and kills Stromberg but again encounters Jaws, whom he drops into a shark tank. However, Jaws kills the shark and escapes. Bond and Amasova flee in an <a href="/wiki/Escape_pod" title="Escape pod">escape pod</a> as <i>Atlantis</i> is sunk by torpedoes. Amasova picks up Bond's gun and reminds him that she has vowed to kill him, but then chooses not to and the two embrace. The Royal Navy recovers the pod and the two spies are seen in an intimate embrace through its port window, much to the bemusement of their superiors on the ship.
</p><p>While trying to escape from <a href="/wiki/East_Berlin" title="East Berlin">East</a> to <a href="/wiki/West_Berlin" title="West Berlin">West Berlin</a>, British agent 009 is fatally wounded and dies after reaching the residence of the British Ambassador, dressed as a circus clown and carrying a fake <a href="/wiki/Faberg%C3%A9_egg" title="Fabergé egg">Fabergé egg</a>. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MI6" title="MI6">MI6</a> immediately suspects Soviet involvement and, after seeing the real egg appear at an auction in London, sends James Bond to investigate and find out the identity of the seller. At the auction, Bond is able to swap the real egg with the fake and engages in a bidding war with exiled Afghan prince Kamal Khan, forcing Khan to pay £500,000 for the fake egg. Bond follows Khan back to his <a href="/wiki/Monsoon_Palace" title="Monsoon Palace">palace</a> in <a href="/wiki/Rajasthan" title="Rajasthan">Rajasthan</a>, India, where Bond defeats Khan in a game of <a href="/wiki/Backgammon" title="Backgammon">backgammon</a>. Bond escapes with his contact Vijay, foiling the attempts of Khan's bodyguard <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gobinda" title="Gobinda">Gobinda</a> to kill the pair. Bond is seduced by one of Khan's associates, Magda, and notices that she has a <a href="/wiki/Blue-ringed_octopus" title="Blue-ringed octopus">blue-ringed octopus</a> tattoo. Bond permits Magda to steal the real Fabergé egg fitted with listening and tracking devices by Q, while Gobinda captures and takes Bond to Khan's palace. After Bond escapes from his room, he listens in on the bug in the Fabergé egg and discovers that Khan is working with Orlov, a Soviet general, who is seeking to expand Soviet control into West-Central Europe.
</p><p>After escaping from Khan's palace, Bond infiltrates a floating palace in <a href="/wiki/Udaipur" title="Udaipur">Udaipur</a>, India, and there finds its owner, Octopussy, a wealthy business woman, smuggler and associate of Khan. She also leads the Octopus cult, of which Magda is a member. Octopussy has a personal connection with Bond: she is the daughter of the late Major Dexter-Smythe, whom Bond was assigned to arrest for treason. Bond allowed the Major to commit suicide rather than face trial, and is thanked by Octopussy for offering her father an honorable alternative, inviting Bond to stay on as her guest. Earlier in Khan's palace and later in Octopussy's palace, Bond finds out that Orlov has been supplying Khan with priceless Soviet treasures, replacing them with replicas while Khan has been smuggling the real versions into the West via Octopussy's circus troupe. Orlov is planning to meet Khan at <a href="/wiki/Chemnitz" title="Chemnitz">Karl-Marx-Stadt</a> (Chemnitz) in <a href="/wiki/East_Germany" title="East Germany">East Germany</a>, where the circus is scheduled to perform. Gobinda sends hoodlums to kill Bond, but he and Octopussy gain the upper hand when the assassins break into the palace. Bond learns from Q that Vijay has been killed by the goons.
</p><p>Travelling to East Germany, Bond infiltrates the circus and finds out that Orlov replaced the Soviet treasures with a nuclear warhead, primed to explode during the circus show at a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/US_Air_Force" title="US Air Force">US Air Force</a> base in <a href="/wiki/West_Germany" title="West Germany">West Germany</a>. The explosion would trigger Europe into seeking disarmament in the belief that the bomb was a US one that detonated by accident, leaving its borders open to a Soviet invasion. Bond takes Orlov's car, drives it along the train tracks and boards the moving circus train. Orlov gives chase, but is killed at the border by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/German_Democratic_Republic" title="German Democratic Republic">East German</a> guards after they mistake Orlov for a <a href="/wiki/Eastern_Bloc_emigration_and_defection" title="Eastern Bloc emigration and defection">defector</a>.

Bond penetrates the base and disguises himself as a clown to evade the West German police. He attempts to convince Octopussy that Khan has betrayed her by showing her one of the treasures found in Orlov's car, which she was to smuggle for him. Octopussy realises that she has been tricked, and assists Bond in deactivating the warhead.
</p><p>Bond and Octopussy return separately to India. Bond arrives at Khan's palace just as Octopussy and her troops have launched an assault on the grounds. Octopussy attempts to kill Khan, but is captured by Gobinda. While Octopussy's team, led by Magda, overpower Khan's guards, Khan and Gobinda abandon the palace, taking Octopussy as a hostage. Bond pursues them as they attempt to escape in their plane, clinging to the fuselage and disabling one of the engines. In the subsequent struggle with Bond, Gobinda takes a deadly plummet off the roof of the plane and Bond rescues Octopussy from Khan, the pair jumping onto a nearby cliff only seconds before the plane crashes into a mountain, killing Khan. While <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" title="M (James Bond)">M</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/General_Gogol" title="General Gogol">General Gogol</a> discuss the transport of the jewellery, Bond recuperates with Octopussy aboard her private boat in India.
</p><p>MI6 agent James Bond is sent to <a href="/wiki/Siberia" title="Siberia">Siberia</a> to locate the body of 003 and recover a <a href="/wiki/Integrated_circuit" title="Integrated circuit">microchip</a> originating from the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a>.

</p><p>Bond visits <a href="/wiki/Ascot_Racecourse" title="Ascot Racecourse">Ascot Racecourse</a> to observe the company's owner, Max Zorin. Zorin's horse wins a race but proves hard to control. Sir Godfrey Tibbett, a racehorse trainer and MI6 agent, believes that Zorin's horse was drugged, although tests proved negative. Through Tibbett, Bond meets with French private detective Achille Aubergine who informs Bond that Zorin is holding a horse sale later in the month. During their dinner at the <a href="/wiki/Eiffel_Tower" title="Eiffel Tower">Eiffel Tower</a>, Aubergine is assassinated by Zorin's bodyguard <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/May_Day_(James_Bond)" title="May Day (James Bond)">May Day</a>, who subsequently escapes after being chased by Bond.
</p><p>Bond and Tibbett travel to Zorin's estate for the horse sale. Bond is puzzled by a woman who rebuffs him and finds out that Zorin has written her a cheque for $5 million. At night, Bond and Tibbett break into Zorin's laboratory and learn that he is implanting <a href="/wiki/Adrenaline" title="Adrenaline">adrenaline</a>-releasing devices in the horses. Zorin identifies Bond as an agent, has May Day assassinate Tibbett, and believes that his attempt to assassinate Bond has been successful. Afterwards, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/General_Gogol" title="General Gogol">General Gogol</a> of the <a href="/wiki/KGB" title="KGB">KGB</a> confronts Zorin for killing Bond without permission and reveals that Zorin was initially trained and financed by the KGB but has now gone rogue. Later, Zorin unveils to a group of investors his plan to destroy Silicon Valley which will give him—and the potential investors—a monopoly over the microchip industry.
</p><p>Bond goes to San Francisco, where he learns from CIA agent Chuck Lee that Zorin could be the product of <a href="/wiki/Nazi_human_experimentation" title="Nazi human experimentation">medical experimentation</a> with steroids performed by a Nazi scientist who is now Zorin's physician, Dr. Carl Mortner. Later, Bond investigates a nearby oil rig owned by Zorin and while there, finds KGB agent Pola Ivanova recording Zorin's conversation. Ivanova's partner Klolktoff is captured and killed while trying to place <a href="/wiki/Limpet_mine" title="Limpet mine">limpet mines</a> on the rig, but Ivanova and Bond escape. They go to her place where Bond is able to steal the recording. Bond tracks down the woman that Zorin attempted to pay off, State Geologist Stacey Sutton, and discovers that Zorin is trying to purchase her family's oil business.
</p><p>The two travel to <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_City_Hall" title="San Francisco City Hall">San Francisco City Hall</a> to review Zorin's submitted plan. However, Zorin is alerted to their presence and arrives together with May Day, who murders Chuck. When Bond and Sutton try to procure the plans, Zorin kills chief geologist W. G. Howe with Bond's gun and sets fire to the building to frame Bond for the murder and kill him and Sutton at the same time. Bond and Sutton survive the fire, but when the police prepare to arrest Bond for the murders of Howe and Chuck, he and Sutton escape in a fire truck.
</p><p>Bond and Sutton infiltrate Zorin's mine and discover his plot to detonate explosives beneath the lakes along the <a href="/wiki/Hayward_Fault_Zone" title="Hayward Fault Zone">Hayward</a> and <a href="/wiki/San_Andreas_Fault" title="San Andreas Fault">San Andreas</a> faults, flooding them and resulting in the Silicon Valley area to be permanently submerged underwater. A larger bomb is also in the mine to destroy a "geological lock" that prevents the two faults from moving at the same time. Once the bombs are in place, Zorin and his security chief Scarpine flood the mines, killing the mine workers. Sutton escapes, while Bond and May Day are stranded in the mine. When May Day realizes that Zorin has abandoned her, she helps Bond remove the larger bomb by putting the device onto a handcar and pushing it out of the mine. When the handcar's brakes block their attempt, May Day stays on it to make it roll clear of the mine; once outside, the bomb explodes, killing her.
</p><p>Zorin, who had escaped in his airship with Scarpine and Mortner, abducts Sutton, but Bond grabs hold of the airship's mooring rope. Zorin tries to knock Bond off the rope, but Bond manages to moor the airship to the framework of the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge" title="Golden Gate Bridge">Golden Gate Bridge</a>. Sutton attacks Zorin, and in the fracas, Mortner and Scarpine are temporarily knocked out. Sutton flees and joins Bond out on the bridge, but Zorin pursues them with an axe. The ensuing fight between Zorin and Bond culminates with Zorin falling to his death in the waters of San Francisco Bay. An enraged Mortner attempts to attack Bond using lit sticks of dynamite, but Bond cuts the airship cable free, causing Mortner to drop the dynamite in the cabin. The dynamite explodes, killing Mortner, Scarpine, and destroying the airship. General Gogol awards Bond the <a href="/wiki/Order_of_Lenin" title="Order of Lenin">Order of Lenin</a> for foiling Zorin's strategy.
</p><p>Three MI6 agents are killed under mysterious circumstances within 24 hours in the <a href="/wiki/Headquarters_of_the_United_Nations" title="Headquarters of the United Nations">United Nations headquarters in New York City</a>, <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a> nation of San Monique, while monitoring the operations of the island's dictator, Dr. Kananga. James Bond, Agent 007, is sent to New York to investigate. Kananga is also in New York, visiting the United Nations. Just after Bond arrives, his driver is shot dead by Whisper, one of Kananga's men, while taking Bond to meet <a href="/wiki/Felix_Leiter" title="Felix Leiter">Felix Leiter</a> of the CIA. Bond is nearly killed in the ensuing car crash.
</p><p>A trace on the killer's licence plate eventually leads Bond to Mr. Big, a ruthless gangster who runs a chain of restaurants throughout the United States. It is here that Bond first meets <a href="/wiki/Bond_girl" title="Bond girl">Solitaire</a>, a beautiful <a href="/wiki/Tarot" title="Tarot">tarot</a> reader who has the power of the <a href="/wiki/Obeah" title="Obeah">Obeah</a> and can see both the future and remote events in the present. Mr. Big demands that his henchmen kill Bond, but Bond overpowers them and escapes unscathed. Bond flies to San Monique, where he meets Rosie Carver, a CIA <a href="/wiki/Double_agent" title="Double agent">double agent</a>. They meet up with Bond's friend, Quarrel Jr., who takes them by boat near Solitaire's home. Bond suspects Rosie of working for Kananga and she is killed by Kananga to stop her confessing the truth to Bond. Inside Solitaire's house, Bond uses a stacked deck of tarot cards that show only "<a href="/wiki/The_Lovers" title="The Lovers">The Lovers</a>" to trick her into thinking that fate is meant for them; Bond then seduces her. Solitaire loses her ability to foretell the future when she loses her virginity to Bond, and she decides to cooperate with Bond, based both upon her attraction to him as well as her having grown tired of being controlled by Kananga.
</p><p>Bond and Solitaire escape by boat and fly to New Orleans. There, Bond is captured by Mr. Big, who removes his <a href="/wiki/Facial_prosthetic" title="Facial prosthetic">prosthetic face</a> and is revealed to be Kananga. He has been producing heroin, and is protecting the poppy fields by exploiting the San Monique locals' fear of voodoo priest <a href="/wiki/List_of_henchmen_of_James_Bond_villains#Live_and_Let_Die" title="List of henchmen of James Bond villains">Baron Samedi</a>, as well as the <a href="/wiki/Occult" title="Occult">occult</a>. Through his alter ego Mr. Big, Kananga plans to distribute the heroin free of charge at his restaurants, which will increase the number of addicts. He intends to bankrupt other drug dealers with his giveaway, then charge high prices for his heroin later in order to capitalise on the huge drug dependencies he has cultivated.
</p><p>Angry at her for having sex with Bond and that her ability to read tarot cards is now gone, Kananga turns Solitaire over to Baron Samedi to be sacrificed. Meanwhile, Kananga's one-armed henchman, Tee Hee Johnson, leaves Bond to be eaten by <a href="/wiki/Crocodilia" title="Crocodilia">crocodilians</a> at a farm in the <a href="/wiki/Deep_South" title="Deep South">Deep South</a> backwoods. Bond escapes by running along the animals' backs to safety. After setting a drug laboratory on fire, he steals a speedboat and escapes, pursued by Kananga's men, as well as <a href="/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_allies#Sheriff_J.W._Pepper" title="List of James Bond allies">Sheriff J.W. Pepper</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Louisiana_State_Police" title="Louisiana State Police">Louisiana State Police</a>.
</p><p>Bond travels to San Monique and sets timed explosives throughout the poppy fields. He rescues Solitaire from the voodoo sacrifice and throws Samedi into a coffin of venomous snakes. Bond and Solitaire escape below ground into Kananga's lair. Kananga captures them both and proceeds to lower them into a shark tank. However, Bond escapes and forces Kananga to swallow a compressed-gas pellet used in shark guns, causing his body to inflate and explode.
</p><p>Leiter puts Bond and Solitaire on a train leaving the country. Tee Hee sneaks aboard and attempts to kill Bond, but Bond cuts the wires of his prosthetic arm and throws him out the window. As the film ends, a laughing Samedi is revealed to be perched on the front of the speeding train.
</p><p>In London, a golden bullet with James Bond's code "007" etched into its surface is received by <a href="/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service" title="Secret Intelligence Service">MI6</a>. It is believed that it was sent by the famed assassin <a href="/wiki/Francisco_Scaramanga" title="Francisco Scaramanga">Francisco Scaramanga</a>, who uses a golden gun to intimidate the agent. Because of the perceived threat to the agent's life, <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" title="M (James Bond)">M</a> relieves Bond of a mission revolving around the work of the solar energy scientist named Gibson, thought to be in possession of information crucial to solving the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/1973_energy_crisis" title="1973 energy crisis">energy crisis</a> with <a href="/wiki/Solar_power" title="Solar power">solar power</a>.

</p><p>After retrieving a spent golden bullet from a belly dancer in <a href="/wiki/Beirut" title="Beirut">Beirut</a> and tracking its manufacturer to <a href="/wiki/Macau" title="Macau">Macau</a>, Bond encounters Andrea Anders, Scaramanga's mistress, collecting the shipment of golden bullets at a <a href="/wiki/Casino" title="Casino">casino</a>. Bond follows her to Hong Kong and, in her <a href="/wiki/The_Peninsula_Hong_Kong" title="The Peninsula Hong Kong">Peninsula Hotel</a> room, pressures Anders to expose information about Scaramanga, his appearance and his plans; she directs him to the <a href="/wiki/Bottoms_Up_Club" title="Bottoms Up Club">Bottoms Up Club</a>. The club proves to be the location of Scaramanga's next <a href="/wiki/Contract_killing" title="Contract killing">hit</a>, Gibson, from whom Scaramanga's <a href="/wiki/Dwarfism" title="Dwarfism">dwarf</a> henchman Nick Nack steals the "Solex agitator", a key component of a <a href="/wiki/Power_station#Solar" title="Power station">solar power station</a>. Before Bond can assert his innocence in Gibson's death, he is taken away by Lieutenant Hip and transported to meet M and <a href="/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)" title="Q (James Bond)">Q</a> in a hidden headquarters in the wreck of the <a href="/wiki/RMS_Queen_Elizabeth" title="RMS Queen Elizabeth">RMS <i>Queen Elizabeth</i></a> in the harbour. M assigns Bond to retrieve the Solex.
</p><p>Bond then travels to <a href="/wiki/Bangkok" title="Bangkok">Bangkok</a> to meet Hai Fat, a wealthy Siamese entrepreneur suspected of arranging Gibson's murder. Bond poses as Scaramanga, but his plan backfires because unbeknown to him, Scaramanga himself is operating at Hai Fat's estate. Bond is captured and placed in Fat's martial arts academy, where the students are instructed to kill him. After escaping with the aid of Hip and his nieces, Bond speeds away on a motorized sampan along the river and reunites with his assistant, Mary Goodnight. Scaramanga subsequently kills Hai Fat and assumes control of his empire, taking the Solex with him.
</p><p>Anders visits Bond, revealing that she sent the bullet to London and wants Bond to kill Scaramanga. In payment, she promises to hand the Solex over to him at a <a href="/wiki/Muay_Thai" title="Muay Thai">Muay Thai</a> venue the next day. At the match, Bond discovers Anders dead and meets Scaramanga. Bond observes the Solex on the floor and is able to smuggle it away to Hip, who passes it to Goodnight. When Goodnight attempts to place a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Homing_device" title="Homing device">homing device</a> on Scaramanga's car, she becomes trapped in the trunk. Bond discovers Scaramanga driving off and steals an <a href="/wiki/AMC_Hornet" title="AMC Hornet">AMC Hornet</a> from a showroom to give chase, coincidentally with vacationing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sheriff_J.W._Pepper" title="Sheriff J.W.

Bond and Pepper follow Scaramanga in a car chase across Bangkok, which concludes when Scaramanga's <a href="/wiki/AMC_Matador" title="AMC Matador">AMC Matador</a> transforms into a plane, which flies himself, Nick Nack and Goodnight away from Bond.
</p><p>Picking up Goodnight's tracking signal, Bond flies a seaplane into <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="People's Republic of China">Red Chinese</a> waters and lands at <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ko_Tapu" title="Ko Tapu">Scaramanga's island</a>. Scaramanga welcomes and shows Bond the solar power plant operation that he has taken over, the technology for which he intends to sell to the highest bidder. While demonstrating the equipment, Scaramanga uses a powerful energy beam to destroy Bond's plane.
</p><p>Scaramanga then proposes a pistol <a href="/wiki/Duel" title="Duel">duel</a> with Bond on the beach; the two men stand back to back and are officiated by Nick Nack to take twenty paces, but when Bond turns and fires, Scaramanga has vanished. Nick Nack leads Bond into Scaramanga's Funhouse where Bond stands in the place of a mannequin of himself; when Scaramanga walks by, Bond outwits and kills him. Goodnight kills Scaramanga's security chief Kra, sending his body into one of the temperature control vats. His body heat raises the temperature of the helium cooling the solar plant, which begins to spiral out of control. Bond retrieves the Solex unit just before the island is destroyed, and they escape unharmed in Scaramanga's <a href="/wiki/Junk_(ship)" title="Junk (ship)">Chinese junk</a>. Bond then fends off a final attack by Nick Nack, who smuggled himself aboard, placing Nick Nack in a wicker basket on the mainmast of the ship. Bond and Goodnight celebrate their mission by romancing each other.

The plot begins at Shrublands sanatorium, located close to a NATO air base. Coincidentally, James Bond is at Shrublands to improve his health. There, he notices that fellow patient Count Lippe has a <a href="/wiki/Tong_(organization)" title="Tong (organization)">Tong</a> tattoo. Bond searches Lippe's room, and is seen leaving by the man in the adjoining room, whose head is covered in bandages. Lippe tries to murder Bond with a <a href="/wiki/Traction_(orthopedics)" title="Traction (orthopedics)">spinal traction</a> machine, but Bond is saved by his physiotherapist, Patricia Fearing.
</p><p>Lippe and Angelo Palazzi, the bandaged man, are part of SPECTRE's plot. Angelo's face has been <a href="/wiki/Plastic_surgery" title="Plastic surgery">surgically altered</a> to match <a href="/wiki/French_Air_Force" title="French Air Force">French Air Force</a> pilot François Derval, who is also staying at Shrublands. Derval is slated to fly on a training mission aboard an <a href="/wiki/Royal_Air_Force" title="Royal Air Force">RAF</a> <a href="/wiki/Avro_Vulcan" title="Avro Vulcan">Avro Vulcan</a> strategic jet bomber loaded with two atomic bombs. Angelo kills Derval, collects $100,000 from SPECTRE Agent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fiona_Volpe" title="Fiona Volpe">Fiona Volpe</a>, then demands an extra $150,000 for the job. Fiona seemingly acquiesces. The next morning, Angelo takes Derval's place on the flight. Angelo gasses the rest of the crew, then flies the Vulcan to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bahamas" title="Bahamas">Bahamas</a>, landing it in shallow water near Largo's ship, the <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Disco_Volante_(ship)" title="Disco Volante (ship)">Disco Volante</a></i>. SPECTRE <a href="/wiki/Scuba_diving" title="Scuba diving">SCUBA</a> divers, commanded by Largo, retrieve the atomic bombs. Angelo, trapped by his seat strapping, is left to drown by Largo for reneging on his original deal with SPECTRE.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Bond has uncovered Derval's corpse at the clinic. On the motorway to London, Lippe attacks Bond, but a masked motorcyclist kills Lippe with a rocket-propelled grenade and zooms off. The rider abandons the motorcycle and unmasks: it is Fiona, acting on Ernst Stavro Blofeld's orders to eliminate Lippe for hiring the greedy Angelo.
</p><p>At an MI6 conference in London, all of the 00 agents are informed that SPECTRE demands £100 million from NATO in exchange for returning the bombs, and threatens to destroy a major city in the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> or the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> if the ransom is not paid within seven days. Bond recognizes the briefing photograph of Derval as the corpse at Shrublands. He asks M to send him to <a href="/wiki/Nassau,_Bahamas" title="Nassau, Bahamas">Nassau, Bahamas</a>, to contact Derval's sister, <a href="/wiki/Domino_Vitali" title="Domino Vitali">Domino</a>.
</p><p>While snorkelling, Bond meets Domino. Later, at a casino, he encounters Largo and Domino, who is his mistress. Bond enters a game against Largo and wins, and subsequently takes Domino to a dance. Bond and Largo recognise each other as adversaries and begin a tense cat-and-mouse game while still pretending ignorance of each other's true nature. Bond meets <a href="/wiki/Felix_Leiter" title="Felix Leiter">Felix Leiter</a> and <a href="/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)" title="Q (James Bond)">Q</a>, and is issued various gadgets, including an underwater infrared camera, a distress beacon, underwater breathing apparatus, a flare gun, and a <a href="/wiki/Geiger_counter" title="Geiger counter">Geiger counter</a>. Diving under the <i>Disco Volante</i>, Bond fails to find the atomic bombs, but detects an underwater hatch; Bond narrowly escapes Largo's henchmen. The next day, Bond visits Largo at his estate, Palmyra. Bond's partner, Paula Caplan, is taken to Palmyra and then commits suicide with a cyanide pill rather than reveal Bond's next plan.
</p><p>Bond is kidnapped by Volpe, but escapes through a <a href="/wiki/Junkanoo" title="Junkanoo">Junkanoo</a> celebration to the Kiss Kiss club, where Volpe is accidentally shot and killed by her own bodyguard. Bond and Felix search for the Vulcan, finding it underwater and inside a camouflaged cargo net. Bond tells Domino that Largo killed her brother and asks her for help in finding the bombs, giving her his Geiger counter. As she searches for the bombs on the ship, she is caught and tortured by Largo.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Bond disguises himself as a Largo henchman, and uncovers Largo's plan to destroy <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Miami_Beach" title="Miami Beach">Miami Beach</a>. Bond is discovered by Largo, but rescued by Leiter, who has <a href="/wiki/United_States_Coast_Guard" title="United States Coast Guard">United States Coast Guard</a> men parachute into the area via <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/US_Air_Force" title="US Air Force">US Air Force</a> transport aircraft.

Bond climbs into the ship's cockpit, where he battles Largo and two crewmen while the ship weaves erratically among rocks and reefs. Meanwhile, Largo's hired nuclear physicist Kutze turns against him and frees Domino. Largo is about to kill Bond when Domino shoots and kills Largo with a harpoon gun. Bond, Domino, and Kutze jump overboard, and the ship runs aground and explodes.

</p><p>After destroying a <a href="/wiki/Clandestine_chemistry" title="Clandestine chemistry">drug laboratory</a> in <a href="/wiki/Latin_America" title="Latin America">Latin America</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mi6" title="Mi6">MI6</a> agent James Bond travels to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Miami_Beach" title="Miami Beach">Miami Beach</a> for a vacation.  He receives instructions from his superior, <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" title="M (James Bond)">M</a>, via CIA agent <a href="/wiki/Felix_Leiter" title="Felix Leiter">Felix Leiter</a> to observe bullion dealer <a href="/wiki/Auric_Goldfinger" title="Auric Goldfinger">Auric Goldfinger</a> at the hotel there. Bond sees Goldfinger cheating at <a href="/wiki/Gin_rummy" title="Gin rummy">gin rummy</a> and stops him by distracting his employee, Jill Masterson, and <a href="/wiki/Blackmail" title="Blackmail">blackmailing</a> Goldfinger into losing. After Bond and Jill consummate their new relationship, Bond is knocked out by Goldfinger's <a href="/wiki/North_Korea" title="North Korea">Korean</a> manservant <a href="/wiki/Oddjob" title="Oddjob">Oddjob</a>. When Bond awakens, he finds Jill dead, covered in gold paint, having died from "skin suffocation".
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, the <a href="/wiki/Governor_of_the_Bank_of_England" title="Governor of the Bank of England">governor of the Bank of England</a> and M explain to Bond that gold prices vary across the world, allowing one to profit by selling bullion internationally, and his objective is determining how Goldfinger does it by smuggling. To help in his mission, Bond is given a modified <a href="/wiki/Aston_Martin_DB5" title="Aston Martin DB5">Aston Martin DB5</a> and two radar trackers by <a href="/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)" title="Q (James Bond)">Q</a>. Bond arranges to meet Goldfinger socially at his country club in <a href="/wiki/Kent" title="Kent">Kent</a>, and wins a high-stakes <a href="/wiki/Golf" title="Golf">golf</a> game against him with a recovered <a href="/wiki/Nazi_gold" title="Nazi gold">Nazi gold</a> bar at stake. Aware of Bond’s ulterior motives, Goldfinger warns Bond not to interfere in his affairs, reinforcing the threat by having Oddjob demonstrate his steel-rimmed derby as a deadly weapon. Bond follows Goldfinger to <a href="/wiki/Switzerland" title="Switzerland">Switzerland</a>, where Tilly, Jill's sister, attempts to avenge her sister by assassinating Goldfinger with a rifle and fails.
</p><p>Bond sneaks into Goldfinger's plant and discovers Goldfinger smuggles gold by melting it down and incorporating it into the bodywork of his <a href="/wiki/Rolls-Royce_Phantom_III" title="Rolls-Royce Phantom III">Rolls-Royce Phantom III</a>, which he takes with him whenever he travels. Bond also overhears Goldfinger talking to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_China" title="People's Republic of China">Chinese</a> nuclear physicist Mr. Ling about "Operation Grand Slam". Leaving, Bond encounters Tilly as she tries to kill Goldfinger again, but trips an alarm in the process. Oddjob kills Tilly with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Oddjob%27s_hat" title="Oddjob's hat">his hat</a>, and Bond is captured and tied to a cutting table underneath an industrial <a href="/wiki/Laser" title="Laser">laser</a>, which begins to slice a large sheet of gold in half, with Bond lying over it. He then lies to Goldfinger that <a href="/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service" title="Secret Intelligence Service">MI6</a> knows about Grand Slam, causing Goldfinger to spare Bond's life to mislead MI6 into believing Bond has things in hand.
</p><p>Bond is transported by Goldfinger's private jet, piloted by <a href="/wiki/Pussy_Galore" title="Pussy Galore">Pussy Galore</a>, to his <a href="/wiki/Stud_farm" title="Stud farm">stud farm</a> in <a href="/wiki/Lexington,_Kentucky" title="Lexington, Kentucky">Lexington,</a> <a href="/wiki/Kentucky" title="Kentucky">Kentucky</a>. Bond escapes and witnesses Goldfinger's meeting with <a href="/wiki/American_Mafia" title="American Mafia">American mafiosi</a>, who have brought the materials he needs for Operation Grand Slam. Goldfinger reveals that his plan is to rob the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Bullion_Depository" title="United States Bullion Depository">U.S. Bullion Depository</a> at <a href="/wiki/Fort_Knox" title="Fort Knox">Fort Knox</a> by releasing <a href="/wiki/Neurotoxin" title="Neurotoxin">Delta 9 nerve gas</a> into the atmosphere. After Bond is recaptured by Pussy, Goldfinger has the mafiosi killed using the gas. 
</p><p>Bond points out to Goldfinger that his plan to rob the depository will not work, as he will not have enough time to move the gold before the Americans intervene. Goldfinger hints he does not intend to steal the gold, and Bond deduces that Goldfinger will detonate a <a href="/wiki/Dirty_bomb" title="Dirty bomb">dirty bomb</a> inside the vault, designed to render the gold useless for 58 years. This will increase the value of Goldfinger's own gold and give the Chinese an advantage from the potential economic chaos. Goldfinger subtly threatens that should the Americans attempt to locate the bomb or interfere with his plan, he will simply have it detonated somewhere else of significance in the United States. 
</p><p>Operation Grand Slam begins with Pussy Galore's Flying Circus spraying the gas over Fort Knox, seemingly killing all of the military and government personnel nearby including Felix. Goldfinger's private army breaks into Fort Knox and accesses the vault as Goldfinger arrives in a helicopter with the atomic device. In the vault, his henchman Kisch handcuffs Bond to the bomb. Unbeknownst to Goldfinger however, Bond has convinced Galore to alert the Americans and replace the gas with a harmless substance. The troops arise and attack, killing many of Goldfinger's men. Seeing this, Goldfinger locks the vault, takes off his coat, revealing a US Army colonel's uniform, and kills Mr. Ling and several troops, before escaping. Kisch realizes they are trapped and attempts to stop the bomb, but Oddjob throws him to his death. Bond frees himself with Kisch's handcuff keys, but the superhumanly strong Oddjob batters him before he can disarm the bomb. Eventually Bond manages to electrocute Oddjob, then forces the lock off the bomb using gold bullion bars from the vault, but ultimately is unable to disarm it. After finally killing all of Goldfinger's men, the troops open the vault and rush to disarm the bomb. An atomic specialist who accompanied Leiter arrives with seconds to spare, and simply turns off the device with the timer stopped on "0:07".
</p><p>Bond is invited to the <a href="/wiki/White_House" title="White House">White House</a> for lunch with the President. However, Goldfinger hijacks the plane carrying Bond there. In a struggle for Goldfinger's revolver, the gun fires, shooting out a window, creating an <a href="/wiki/Uncontrolled_decompression#Explosive_decompression" title="Uncontrolled decompression">explosive decompression</a>. Goldfinger is blown out of the cabin through the ruptured window. With the plane out of control, Bond rescues Galore and they parachute safely from the aircraft before it crashes into the ocean. A search helicopter passes, but Bond claims “this is no time to be rescued” and draws the parachute over himself and Galore.
</p><p>James Bond—agent 007—pursues <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld" title="Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a> and eventually finds him at a facility where Blofeld look-alikes are being created through surgery. Bond kills a test subject, and later the "real" Blofeld, by drowning him in a pool of superheated mud.
</p><p>While assassins <a href="/wiki/Mr._Wint_and_Mr._Kidd" title="Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd">Mr. Wint and Mr. Kidd</a> systematically kill several diamond smugglers, <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" title="M (James Bond)">M</a> suspects that <a href="/wiki/South_Africa" title="South Africa">South African</a> diamonds are being stockpiled to depress prices by <a href="/wiki/Dumping_(pricing_policy)" title="Dumping (pricing policy)">dumping</a>, and orders Bond to uncover the smuggling ring. Disguised as professional smuggler and assassin Peter Franks, Bond travels to <a href="/wiki/Amsterdam" title="Amsterdam">Amsterdam</a> to meet contact <a href="/wiki/Tiffany_Case" title="Tiffany Case">Tiffany Case</a>. The real Franks shows up on the way, but Bond intercepts and kills him, then switches IDs to make it seem like Franks is Bond. Case and Bond then go to <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, smuggling the diamonds inside Franks' corpse.
</p><p>At the airport Bond meets his CIA ally <a href="/wiki/Felix_Leiter" title="Felix Leiter">Felix Leiter</a>, then travels to <a href="/wiki/Las_Vegas" title="Las Vegas">Las Vegas</a>. At a funeral home, Franks' body is cremated and the diamonds are passed on to another smuggler, Shady Tree. Bond is nearly killed by Wint and Kidd when they put him into a coffin and send to a cremation oven, but Tree stops the process when he discovers that the diamonds in Franks' body were fakes planted by Bond and the CIA.
</p><p>Bond tells Leiter to ship him the real diamonds. Bond then goes to the Whyte House, a casino-hotel owned by the reclusive billionaire Willard Whyte, where Tree works as a stand-up comedian. Bond discovers there that Tree has been killed by Wint and Kidd, who did not know that the diamonds were fake.
</p><p>At the <a href="/wiki/Craps" title="Craps">craps</a> table Bond meets the opportunistic <a href="/wiki/Bond_girl" title="Bond girl">Plenty O'Toole</a>, and after gambling, brings her to his room. Gang members ambush them, throwing O'Toole out the window and into the pool. Bond spends the rest of the night with Tiffany Case, instructing her to retrieve the real diamonds at the <a href="/wiki/Circus_Circus_Las_Vegas" title="Circus Circus Las Vegas">Circus Circus</a> casino.
</p><p>Tiffany reneges on her deal to meet back with Bond and instead flees, passing off the diamonds to the next smuggler. However, seeing that O'Toole was killed after being mistaken for her, Tiffany changes her mind. She drives Bond to the airport, where the diamonds are given to Whyte's casino manager, Bert Saxby, who is followed to a remote facility. Bond enters the apparent destination of the diamonds; a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where a satellite is being built by Professor Metz, a laser refraction specialist. When Bond's cover is blown, he escapes by stealing a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Moon_buggy" title="Moon buggy">moon buggy</a> and reunites with Tiffany.
</p><p>Bond scales the walls to the Whyte House's top floor to confront Whyte. He is instead met by two identical Blofelds, who use an electronic device to sound like Whyte. Bond kills one of the Blofelds, which turns out to be a look-alike. He is then knocked out by gas, picked up by Wint and Kidd, and taken out to <a href="/wiki/Las_Vegas_Valley" title="Las Vegas Valley">Las Vegas Valley</a>, where he is placed in a pipeline and left to die.
</p><p>Bond escapes, then calls Blofeld, using a similar electronic device to pose as Saxby. He finds out Whyte's location and rescues him, Saxby being killed in the gunfight. In the meantime, Blofeld abducts Case. With the help of Whyte, Bond raids the lab and uncovers Blofeld's plot to create a <a href="/wiki/Sun_gun" title="Sun gun">laser satellite</a> using the diamonds, which by now has already been sent into orbit. With the satellite, Blofeld destroys nuclear weapons in China, the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> and the United States, then proposes an international auction for global nuclear supremacy.
</p><p>Whyte identifies an <a href="/wiki/Oil_platform" title="Oil platform">oil platform</a> off the coast of <a href="/wiki/Baja_California" title="Baja California">Baja California</a> as Blofeld's likely base of operations. After Bond's attempt to change the cassette containing the satellite control codes fails due to a mistake by Tiffany, a helicopter attack on the oil rig is launched by Leiter and the CIA.
</p><p>Blofeld tries to escape in a <a href="/wiki/Midget_submarine" title="Midget submarine">midget submarine</a>, but Bond gains control of the submarine's launch crane and crashes the sub into the control room, causing both the satellite control and the base to be destroyed. Bond and Tiffany then head for Britain on a <a href="/wiki/SS_Canberra" title="SS Canberra">cruise ship</a>, where Wint and Kidd pose as room-service stewards and attempt to kill them with a hidden bomb. Bond kills them instead.
</p><p>American <a href="/wiki/NASA" title="NASA">NASA</a> <a href="/wiki/Spacecraft" title="Spacecraft">spacecraft</a> <a href="/wiki/Project_Gemini" title="Project Gemini">Jupiter 16</a> is hijacked from orbit by an unidentified spaceship. The United States suspects it to be the work of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Soviets" title="Soviets">Soviets</a>, but the British suspect Japanese involvement since the spacecraft, after having "swallowed" Jupiter 16, landed in the <a href="/wiki/Sea_of_Japan" title="Sea of Japan">Sea of Japan</a>. To investigate, <a href="/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service" title="Secret Intelligence Service">MI6</a> operative James Bond is sent to Tokyo, after faking his own death in Hong Kong and being <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Buried_at_sea" title="Buried at sea">buried at sea</a> from <a href="/wiki/HMS_Tenby_(F65)" title="HMS Tenby (F65)">HMS <i>Tenby</i></a>.
</p><p>Upon his arrival, Bond meets a mysterious Japanese woman while watching a <a href="/wiki/Sumo" title="Sumo">sumo</a> match. She introduces Bond to local MI6 operative Dikko Henderson, who claims to have critical evidence about the rogue craft, but is killed before he can elaborate. Bond chases and kills the assailant, taking the assailant's clothing as a disguise, and is driven in the getaway car to Osato Chemicals. Once there, Bond subdues the driver and breaks into the office safe of president Mr. Osato. After obtaining certain documents, Bond is pursued by armed security, but is rescued by the woman he had met earlier, who flees to a secluded subway station. Bond chases her, but falls down a trap door leading to the office of the head of the Japanese secret service, <a href="/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_allies#Tiger_Tanaka" title="List of James Bond allies">Tiger Tanaka</a>, who reveals that the woman is his assistant <a href="/wiki/Aki_(James_Bond)" title="Aki (James Bond)">Aki</a>. The stolen documents are examined, and found to include a photograph of the cargo ship <i>Ning-Po</i>, with a <a href="/wiki/Microdot" title="Microdot">microdot</a> message saying the tourist who took the photo was killed as a security precaution. While at Tanaka's spa, Bond meets with Aki again and they spend the night together.
</p><p>Bond goes to Osato Chemicals to meet Mr. Osato himself, masquerading as a potential new buyer. Osato humours Bond, but after their meeting, he orders his secretary, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Helga_Brandt" title="Helga Brandt">Helga Brandt</a>, to have him killed. Outside the building, assassins open fire on Bond before Aki rescues him again. Bond and Aki drive to <a href="/wiki/Kobe" title="Kobe">Kobe</a>, where the <i>Ning-Po</i> is docked. They investigate the company's dock facilities, and discover that the ship was delivering elements for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rocket_fuel" title="Rocket fuel">rocket fuel</a>. They are discovered, but Bond eludes the henchmen until Aki gets away; however, Bond is captured. He wakes, tied up in <a href="/wiki/SPECTRE" title="SPECTRE">SPECTRE</a> operative Helga Brandt's cabin on the <i>Ning-Po</i>. In a sexy cocktail dress, she interrogates Bond, but he thinks of managing to bribe his way to freedom when she suddenly chooses to enjoy herself by kissing and freeing him. Brandt flies Bond to Tokyo the next day, but en route, she sets off a flare in the plane and bails out, finally persuaded to kill him. Bond manages to land the plane.
</p><p>After finding out where the <i>Ning-Po</i> unloaded, Bond flies over the area in a heavily armed <a href="/wiki/Autogyro" title="Autogyro">autogyro</a> created by <a href="/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)" title="Q (James Bond)">Q</a>. Near a <a href="/wiki/Volcano" title="Volcano">volcano</a>, Bond is attacked by helicopters, which he defeats, confirming his suspicions that the enemy's base is nearby. A Soviet spacecraft is then captured in orbit by another unidentified craft, heightening tensions between Russia and the United States. The mysterious spaceship lands in an extensive base hidden inside the volcano. It soon turns out that the true mastermind behind this is <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld" title="Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Ernst Stavro Blofeld</a>, the mysterious leader of SPECTRE who has been hired by the People's Republic of China to start a Soviet-American war. Blofeld summons Osato to answer for not having killed Bond; Osato immediately blames his assistant, Brandt. Blofeld then gives Osato a last chance, but as Brandt leaves, he activates a mechanism that drops her to her death into a pool filled with <a href="/wiki/Piranha" title="Piranha">piranhas</a>. Blofeld then orders Osato to kill Bond.
</p><p>Bond is then informed of Tanaka's plan: he is to train with Tanaka's <a href="/wiki/Ninja" title="Ninja">ninjas</a>, disguise himself as a Japanese fisherman alongside a Japanese wife, and infiltrate SPECTRE's island. Before this plan can be completed, Aki is killed when she accidentally ingests poison that a SPECTRE assassin had meant for Bond to take. Bond quickly moves on and enters into a fake marriage to Tanaka's student, <a href="/wiki/Kissy_Suzuki" title="Kissy Suzuki">Kissy Suzuki</a>. Acting on her lead, the pair reconnoitre a cave and the volcano above it. Establishing that the mouth of the volcano is a disguised hatch to the secret rocket base, Bond slips in, while Kissy goes to alert Tanaka. Bond locates and frees the captured astronauts and, with their help, steals a <a href="/wiki/Space_suit" title="Space suit">space suit</a> in an attempt to infiltrate the SPECTRE spacecraft, "Bird One". However, Blofeld spots Bond, and he is detained while Bird One is launched; Bond is taken into the control room where he meets Blofeld face-to-face for the first time.
</p><p>Bird One closes in on the American space capsule, and U.S. forces prepare to launch a nuclear attack on the USSR. Meanwhile, the Japanese ninjas approach the base's entrance, but are detected and fired upon. Bond manages to open the hatch, letting in the ninjas. During the ensuing battle, Bond fights his way back to the control room, kills Blofeld's bodyguard Hans by flipping his body into the piranha pool, and activates Bird One's <a href="/wiki/Self-destruct" title="Self-destruct">self-destruct</a> before it reaches the American craft. The Americans stand down their forces.
</p><p>Blofeld, who had earlier killed Osato to demonstrate the price of failure to Bond, activates the base's self-destruct system, a bomb that triggers a volcanic eruption and escapes. Bond, Kissy, Tanaka, and the surviving ninjas leave before the eruption destroys the base, and are picked up by the Japanese Maritime Forces and the British Secret Service.
</p><p>Seeking to exact revenge on James Bond (007) for killing its agent Dr. No and destroying the organisation's assets in the <a href="/wiki/Caribbean" title="Caribbean">Caribbean</a>, the international criminal organisation <a href="/wiki/SPECTRE" title="SPECTRE">SPECTRE</a> begins training agents to kill Bond. Their star pupil is Donald "Red" Grant, an Irish assassin who proves his mettle by killing a Bond impostor in 1 minute and 52 seconds on a training course with a garrote wire concealed in his wristwatch.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the organisation's chief planner, a <a href="/wiki/Czechoslovak_Socialist_Republic" title="Czechoslovak Socialist Republic">Czech</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Chess_grandmaster" title="Chess grandmaster">chess grandmaster</a> named Kronsteen (Number 5), devises a plan to play British and Soviet intelligence against each other to procure a Lektor <a href="/wiki/Cryptography" title="Cryptography">cryptographic</a> device from the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviets</a>. SPECTRE's chief executive, <a href="/wiki/Ernst_Stavro_Blofeld" title="Ernst Stavro Blofeld">Number 1</a>, puts <a href="/wiki/Rosa_Klebb" title="Rosa Klebb">Rosa Klebb</a> (Number 3), a former colonel of <a href="/wiki/SMERSH" title="SMERSH">SMERSH</a> (the counter-intelligence branch of Soviet Intelligence) who has defected to SPECTRE in the West, in charge of the mission as chief of operations. Klebb chooses Grant to protect Bond until he acquires the Lektor and then to eliminate 007 and steal the cipher machine for SPECTRE. As part of the scheme, Klebb recruits the beautiful <a href="/wiki/Tatiana_Romanova" title="Tatiana Romanova">Tatiana Romanova</a>, a cipher clerk at the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/USSR" title="USSR">Soviet</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Consulate" title="Consulate">consulate</a> in <a href="/wiki/Istanbul" title="Istanbul">Istanbul</a>, who believes the ex-colonel is still  working for SMERSH.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" title="M (James Bond)">M</a> informs Bond that Romanova has contacted their "Station 'T'" in Turkey, claiming to have fallen in love with Bond from his file photo. She offers to defect to the West, and will bring a top-secret Lektor with her to sweeten the deal, but only on the condition that Bond handle her case, personally. Prior to his departure, Bond is supplied by <a href="/wiki/Q_(James_Bond)" title="Q (James Bond)">Q</a> with an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Attach%C3%A9_case" title="Attaché case">attaché case</a> containing a concealed throwing knife, gold sovereigns, a special <a href="/wiki/Tear_gas" title="Tear gas">tear gas</a> booby trap connected to the lock mechanism, and ammunition for an included <a href="/wiki/ArmaLite_AR-7" title="ArmaLite AR-7">ArmaLite AR-7</a> folding sniper rifle with an infrared night scope.
</p><p>After travelling to Istanbul, Bond heads into the city to meet with station head <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_James_Bond_allies_in_From_Russia_with_Love#Ali_Kerim_Bey" title="List of James Bond allies in From Russia with Love">Ali Kerim Bey</a>, tailed by <a href="/wiki/People%27s_Republic_of_Bulgaria" title="People's Republic of Bulgaria">Bulgarian</a> secret agents working for the Russians. They are in turn tailed by Grant, who kills one of them after Bond is taken back to his hotel, stealing their car and dumping it outside the Soviet Consulate to provoke hostilities between British and Soviet Intelligence. In response, the Soviets bomb Kerim's office with a <a href="/wiki/Limpet_mine" title="Limpet mine">limpet mine</a>; Kerim, however, is away from his desk for a tryst with his mistress.  Bond and he then investigate the attack by spying on a Soviet consulate meeting through a periscope installed in the underground aqueducts beneath Istanbul. Thus, they learn that the Soviet agent Krilencu is responsible for the bombing. Kerim Bey declares it unwise to stay in the city under such circumstances and takes Bond to a rural <a href="/wiki/Romani_people" title="Romani people">gypsy</a> settlement. However, Krilencu learns of this and promptly attacks a gypsy feast, where Bond and Kerim are honoured guests, with a band of hired Bulgarian fighters. Much to Bond's confusion, he is saved from an enemy fighter during the attack by a distant sniper shot from Grant. The following night, Bond and Kerim Bey track Krilencu to his hideout, where Kerim Bey kills him with Bond's rifle.
</p><p>Upon returning to his hotel suite that night, Bond finds Romanova waiting for him in his bed and has sex with her; neither is aware that SPECTRE is filming them. The next day, Romanova heads off for a prearranged rendezvous at <a href="/wiki/Hagia_Sophia" title="Hagia Sophia">Hagia Sophia</a> to drop off the floor plans for the consulate, with Grant ensuring Bond receives the plans by killing the other Bulgarian tail who attempts to intercept the drop. Using the plans, Bond and Kerim Bey successfully steal the Lektor, and together with Romanova, escape with the device onto the <i><a href="/wiki/Orient_Express" title="Orient Express">Orient Express</a></i>. On the train, Kerim Bey quickly notices a Soviet security officer named Benz tailing them, prompting him and Bond to subdue him. When Bond leaves Benz and Kerim Bey alone together, Grant kills them and makes it appear as though they killed each other, preventing Bond from leaving the train with Romanova to rendezvous with one of Kerim's men.
</p><p>At the railway station in <a href="/wiki/Belgrade" title="Belgrade">Belgrade</a>, Bond passes on word of Kerim Bey's death to one of his sons, and asks for an agent from <a href="/wiki/Socialist_Federal_Republic_of_Yugoslavia" title="Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia">Station Y</a> to meet him at <a href="/wiki/Zagreb" title="Zagreb">Zagreb</a>. However, when the train arrives at the station, Grant intercepts Nash, sent from Station Y, killing the agent before posing as him. After drugging Romanova at dinner, Grant overpowers Bond before taunting him about SPECTRE's involvement in the theft. After disclosing that Romanova was unaware of what was truly going on, believing she was working for Russia, Grant reveals to Bond his plans to leave behind the film SPECTRE took of him and Romanova at the hotel, along with a forged blackmail letter, to make it appear that their deaths were the result of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Murder-suicide" title="Murder-suicide">murder-suicide</a>, to scandalise the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">British</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_intelligence_community" title="British intelligence community">intelligence community</a>. Bond quickly convinces him to accept a bribe of gold sovereigns in exchange for a final cigarette, tricking Grant into setting off the booby trap in his attaché case. This distracts Grant enough for Bond to attack him in a brutal brawl. In the ensuing fight, Bond narrowly gains the upper hand, stabbing Grant with the case's concealed knife before strangling him with his own <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Garrotte" title="Garrotte">garrotte</a>. Bond then drags the barely conscious Romanova from the train, which has been stopped by a SPECTRE accomplice, where he hijacks Grant's getaway truck and flees the scene with Romanova.
</p><p>Upon hearing the news of Grant's death, Number 1 calls Klebb and Kronsteen onto the carpet to explain what went wrong and remind them that SPECTRE does not tolerate failure. Kronsteen is executed by the henchman Morzeny with a kick from the poison-tipped switchblade in his shoe. Klebb, however, is given one last chance to make good on the mission and acquire the Lektor (which has already been promised to the Russians in a sell-back scheme).
</p><p>The next morning, Bond's stolen truck is intercepted along its escape route by a SPECTRE helicopter, but 007 destroys the attacking aircraft by shooting its co-pilot with his sniper rifle, causing the man to drop a live hand grenade in the cockpit. Thus, Bond and Romanova make it to Grant's escape boat on the <a href="/wiki/Dalmatia" title="Dalmatia">Dalmatian coast</a> and steal that, too, only to be pursued by Morzeny, who leads a squadron of SPECTRE powerboats. Bond, however, escapes by dumping his own powerboat's fuel drums overboard and detonating them with a <a href="/wiki/Flare_gun" title="Flare gun">Very flare</a> to engulf all the chase boats in a sea of flames.
</p><p>Eventually, Romanova and he reach a hotel in <a href="/wiki/Venice" title="Venice">Venice</a>, where they believe themselves to be safe. Klebb, however, disguised as a maid, makes one final attempt on Bond and the Lektor. Klebb tries to kick him with a poisoned switchblade shoe, but Romanova shoots her with her own dropped gun. With the mission accomplished, Bond and Romanova leave Venice on a romantic boat ride, in which course Bond throws Grant's blackmail film into the canal.
</p><p>John Strangways, the British <a href="/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service" title="Secret Intelligence Service">MI6</a> Station Chief in Jamaica, and his secretary are ambushed and killed.  The assassins steal documents related to "Crab Key" and "Doctor No".  In response, <a href="/wiki/M_(James_Bond)" title="M (James Bond)">M</a>, the head of MI6, instructs agent <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/James_Bond_filmography" title="James Bond filmography">James Bond</a> to investigate Strangways' disappearance and to determine whether it is related to his co-operation with the American <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Central Intelligence Agency">Central Intelligence Agency</a> (CIA) on a case involving the disruption of rocket launches from <a href="/wiki/Cape_Canaveral_Air_Force_Station" title="Cape Canaveral Air Force Station">Cape Canaveral</a> by <a href="/wiki/Radar_jamming_and_deception" title="Radar jamming and deception">radio jamming</a>.
</p><p>On his arrival at Kingston Airport, Bond is picked up by a chauffeur claiming to have been sent to take him to <a href="/wiki/King%27s_House,_Jamaica" title="King's House, Jamaica">Government House</a>. Bond determines him to be an enemy agent and, after having him evade a car following them, bests him in a fight. Bond starts to interrogate the chauffeur, who kills himself with a <a href="/wiki/Cyanide" title="Cyanide">cyanide</a> capsule.
</p><p>At Strangways' house, Bond sees a photograph of a boatman with Strangways. Bond locates the boatman, named <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quarrel_(James_Bond)" title="Quarrel (James Bond)">Quarrel</a>, whom he recognises as the driver of the car that followed him. Bond, after overpowering Quarrel and his friend Puss Feller, meets Quarrel's passenger, <a href="/wiki/Felix_Leiter" title="Felix Leiter">Felix Leiter</a>, a CIA agent on the same mission as Bond. The CIA has traced the radio jamming signal to Jamaica, but has not determined its exact origin. Quarrel, who is assisting Leiter, reveals that he had been guiding Strangways around the nearby islands to collect mineral samples. He also mentions the reclusive Dr. No, the owner of Crab Key, an island rigorously protected against trespassers by an armed security force.
</p><p>In Strangways' house, Bond finds a receipt from Professor R.J. Dent concerning rock samples. Bond meets Dent, who claims he <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/assay" title="wikt:assay">assayed</a> the samples for Strangways and determined them to be ordinary rocks.

In the resulting battle, Quarrel is incinerated, while Bond and Ryder are kidnapped, decontaminated in Dr. No's lair, and rendered unconscious with drugged coffee.
</p><p>Upon waking, they are escorted to dine with Dr. No, a Chinese-German criminal scientist who has <a href="/wiki/Prosthesis" title="Prosthesis">prosthetic</a> metal hands due to radiation exposure.

During the mission, Bond notices that the KGB sniper assigned to prevent Koskov's escape is a female cellist from the orchestra. Disobeying his orders to kill the sniper, he instead shoots the rifle from her hands, then uses the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Trans-Siberian_Pipeline" title="Trans-Siberian Pipeline">Trans-Siberian Pipeline</a> to smuggle Koskov across the border into Austria and then on to Britain.
</p><p>In his post-defection debriefing, Koskov informs <a href="/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service" title="Secret Intelligence Service">MI6</a> that the KGB's old policy of '<a href="/wiki/SMERSH_(James_Bond)" title="SMERSH (James Bond)">Smiert Spionam</a>', meaning 'Death to Spies', has been revived by General Leonid Pushkin, the new head of the KGB. Koskov is later abducted from the safe-house and assumed to have been taken back to <a href="/wiki/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a>. Bond is directed to track down Pushkin in <a href="/wiki/Tangier" title="Tangier">Tangier</a> and kill him, to forestall further killings of agents and escalation of tensions between the Soviet Union and the West. Bond agrees to carry out the mission when he learns that the assassin who killed 004 (as depicted in the pre-title sequence) left a note bearing the same message, "Smiert Spionam".
</p><p>Bond returns to Bratislava to track down the cellist, Kara Milovy. He finds out that Koskov's entire defection was staged, and that Kara is actually Koskov's girlfriend. Bond convinces Kara that he is a friend of Koskov's. and persuades her to accompany him to <a href="/wiki/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a>, supposedly to be reunited with him. They escape Bratislava while being pursued by the KGB, crossing over the border into <a href="/wiki/Austria" title="Austria">Austria</a>.

</p><p>During his brief tryst with Milovy in Vienna, Bond visits the <a href="/wiki/Prater" title="Prater">Prater</a> to meet his MI6 ally, Saunders, who discovers a history of financial dealings between Koskov and Whitaker. As he leaves their meeting, Saunders is killed by Koskov's henchman Necros, who again leaves the message "Smiert Spionam". Bond and Kara promptly leave for Tangier, where Bond confronts Pushkin, who disavows any knowledge of "Smiert Spionam" and reveals that Koskov is evading arrest for <a href="/wiki/Embezzlement" title="Embezzlement">embezzlement</a> of government funds. Bond and Pushkin then join forces, and Bond fakes Pushkin's assassination, inducing Whitaker and Koskov to progress with their scheme. Meanwhile, Kara contacts Koskov, who tells her that Bond is actually a KGB agent, and convinces her to drug him so that he can be captured.
</p><p>Koskov, Necros, Kara, and the captive Bond fly to a Soviet air base in <a href="/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_Afghanistan" title="Democratic Republic of Afghanistan">Afghanistan</a>, where Koskov betrays Kara and imprisons her, along with Bond. The pair escape, and in doing so, free a condemned prisoner, Kamran Shah, leader of the local <a href="/wiki/Mujahideen" title="Mujahideen">Mujahideen</a>. Bond and Milovy discover that Koskov is using Soviet funds to buy a massive shipment of <a href="/wiki/Opium" title="Opium">opium</a> from the Mujahideen, intending to keep the profits with enough left over to supply the Soviets with their arms and buy Western arms from Whitaker.
</p><p>With the Mujahideen's help, Bond plants a bomb aboard the cargo plane carrying the opium, but is spotted and has no choice but to barricade himself in the plane. Meanwhile, the Mujahideen attack the air base on horseback and engage the Soviets in a gun battle. During the battle, Milovy drives a jeep into the cargo hold of the plane as Bond takes off, and Necros also leaps aboard at the last second. After a struggle, Bond throws Necros to his death and deactivates the bomb. Bond then notices Shah and his men being pursued by Soviet forces. He re-activates the bomb and drops it out of the plane and onto a bridge, blowing it up and helping Shah and his men escape the Soviets.

</p><p>Bond boards Krest's ship <i>Wavekrest</i> and foils Sanchez's latest drug shipment, stealing five million dollars in the process. He discovers that Sharkey has been killed by Sanchez's henchmen.

They are joined by Fallon, an MI6 agent who was sent by M to apprehend Bond. Sanchez's men rescue him and kill the officers, believing them to be the assassins. Later, with the aid of Bouvier, Q, and Sanchez's girlfriend Lupe Lamora, Bond <a href="/wiki/Frameup" title="Frameup">frames</a> Krest by planting the $5 million in <i>Wavekrest</i>. Sanchez kills Krest via a decompression chamber and admits Bond into his inner circle.
</p><p>Sanchez takes Bond to his base, which is disguised as the headquarters of a religious cult. Bond learns that Sanchez's scientists can dissolve <a href="/wiki/Cocaine" title="Cocaine">cocaine</a> in <a href="/wiki/Gasoline" title="Gasoline">petrol</a> and then sell it disguised as fuel to Asian drug dealers.

Bouvier arrives and shoots Dario, allowing Bond to pull Dario into the shredder, killing him.
</p><p>Sanchez flees as fire consumes his base, taking with him four tankers full of the cocaine and petrol mixture. Bond pursues them by plane, with Bouvier at the controls. During the course of a stunt filled chase through the desert, Bond destroys three of the tankers and kills several of Sanchez's men. Sanchez attacks Bond with a machete aboard the final remaining tanker, which crashes down a hill side. A petrol-soaked Sanchez attempts to kill Bond with his machete.

M tells 007 that the ransom will be paid and forbids him to mount a rescue mission. Bond then enlists Draco and his forces to attack Blofeld's headquarters, while also rescuing Tracy from Blofeld's captivity. The facility is destroyed, and Blofeld escapes the destruction alone in a <a href="/wiki/Bobsleigh" title="Bobsleigh">bobsleigh</a>, with Bond pursuing him.

At the charity event, Largo and Bond play a 3-D video game called <i>Domination</i>; the loser of each turn receives a series of electric shocks of increasing intensity or pays a corresponding cash bet. After losing a few games, Bond ultimately wins. While dancing with Domino, Bond informs her that her brother had been killed on Largo's orders. Bond returns to his villa to find Blush has killed Nicole by drowning her in a water bed. After a vehicle chase on his Q-branch motorbike, Blush captures Bond. She admits that she is impressed with him, and forces Bond to declare in writing that she is his "Number One" sexual partner. Bond distracts her with promises, then uses his Q-branch-issue fountain pen to kill Blush with an explosive dart.

</p><p>Bond travels to Scotland to return M's remains to the grieving widow, Lady Fiona McTarry.  However, the real Lady Fiona has been replaced by SMERSH's Agent Mimi.  The rest of the household have been likewise replaced, with SMERSH’s aim to discredit Bond by destroying his "celibate image". Attempts by a bevy of beauties to seduce Bond fail, but Mimi/Lady Fiona becomes so impressed with Bond that she changes loyalties and helps Bond to foil the plot against him.  On his way back to London, Bond survives another attempt on his life.
</p><p>Bond is promoted to the head of MI6. He learns that many British agents around the world have been eliminated by enemy spies because of their inability to resist sex. Bond is also told that the "sex maniac" who was given the name of "James Bond" when the original Bond retired has gone to work in television. He then orders that all remaining MI6 agents will be named "James Bond 007", to confuse SMERSH. He also creates a rigorous programme to train male agents to ignore the charms of women. Moneypenny recruits "Coop", a karate expert who begins training to resist seductive women: he also meets an exotic agent known as the Detainer.
</p><p>Bond then hires Vesper Lynd, a retired agent turned millionaire, to recruit <a href="/wiki/Baccarat_(card_game)" title="Baccarat (card game)">baccarat</a> expert Evelyn Tremble, whom he intends to use to beat SMERSH agent Le Chiffre. Having embezzled SMERSH's money, Le Chiffre is desperate for money to cover up his theft before he is executed.

Mata uncovers a plan to sell compromising photographs of military leaders from the US, USSR, China and Great Britain at an "art auction", another scheme Le Chiffre hopes to use to raise money. Mata destroys the photos. Le Chiffre's only remaining option is to raise the money by playing baccarat.
</p><p>Tremble arrives at the Casino Royale accompanied by Lynd, who foils an attempt to disable him by seductive SMERSH agent Miss Goodthighs. Later that night, Tremble observes Le Chiffre playing at the casino and realises that he is using infrared sunglasses to cheat. Lynd steals the sunglasses, allowing Evelyn to eventually beat Le Chiffre in a game of baccarat. Lynd is apparently abducted outside the casino, and Tremble is also kidnapped while pursuing her. Le Chiffre, desperate for the winning cheque, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hallucinogenic" title="Hallucinogenic">hallucinogenically</a> tortures Tremble.

They discover that the casino is located atop a giant underground headquarters run by the evil Dr. Noah, secretly Sir James' nephew Jimmy Bond, a former MI6 agent who defected to SMERSH to spite his famous uncle. Jimmy reveals that he plans to use <a href="/wiki/Biological_warfare" title="Biological warfare">biological warfare</a> to make all women beautiful and kill all men over 4-foot-6-inch (1.37 m) tall, leaving him as the "big man" who gets all the girls.

</p><p>Sir James, Moneypenny, Mata and Coop manage to escape from their cell and fight their way back to the Casino Director's office where Sir James establishes Lynd is a double agent. The casino is then overrun by secret agents and a battle ensues. American and French support arrive, but just add to the chaos. Jimmy counts down a series of hiccups, each bringing him closer to doom. Eventually the atomic pill explodes, destroying Casino Royale with everyone inside. Sir James and all of his agents then appear in heaven, and Jimmy Bond is shown descending to Hell.

Later a meteorite lands at <a href="/wiki/Central_Park" title="Central Park">Central Park</a>, and an extraterrestrial <a href="/wiki/Symbiote_(comics)" title="Symbiote (comics)">symbiote</a> follows Peter to his apartment. <a href="/wiki/Harry_Osborn" title="Harry Osborn">Harry Osborn</a>, seeking vengeance after his  <a href="/wiki/Norman_Osborn" title="Norman Osborn">father</a>'s death, attacks Peter with weapons based on his father's <a href="/wiki/Green_Goblin" title="Green Goblin">Green Goblin</a> technology. The battle ends with Harry crashing out and developing <a href="/wiki/Amnesia" title="Amnesia">amnesia</a>, wiping out his memory of Peter as Spider-Man. Meanwhile, police pursue escaped convict Flint Marko, who visits his wife and dying daughter before fleeing again, and falling into an experimental particle accelerator that fuses his <a href="/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a> with the surrounding sand, transforming him into the <a href="/wiki/Sandman_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Sandman (Marvel Comics)">Sandman</a>, with powers to control sand and to deform at will.
</p><p>During a public festival honoring Spider-Man for saving <a href="/wiki/Gwen_Stacy" title="Gwen Stacy">Gwen Stacy</a>'s life, he kisses her, infuriating Mary Jane. The super-powered Marko robs an armored car, and Spider-Man confronts him. Marko easily subdues Spider-Man, and escapes. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/NYPD" title="NYPD">NYPD</a> Captain <a href="/wiki/George_Stacy" title="George Stacy">George Stacy</a>, Gwen's father, informs Peter and Aunt May that Marko was Uncle Ben's true killer; the deceased <a href="/wiki/Burglar_(comics)" title="Burglar (comics)">Dennis Carradine</a> was Marko's accomplice. As Peter sleeps in his Spider-Man suit waiting for Marko, the symbiote assimilates his suit. Peter later awakens on top of a building, discovering his costume changed and his powers enhanced; not only that, the symbiote also brings out Peter's anger. After <a href="/wiki/Lizard_(comics)" title="Lizard (comics)">Curt Connors</a> warns him about the symbiote and wearing the new suit, Spider-Man locates Marko and battles him in a subway tunnel. Discovering that water is Marko's weakness, Spider-Man breaks a water pipe, causing water to reduce Marko to mud and wash him away. Unknowingly to him, Marko survived.
</p><p>Peter's changed personality alienates Mary Jane, whose career is floundering, and she finds solace with Harry, but leaves afterwards in regret. Harry recovers from his amnesia and, urged by a hallucination of his father, blackmails Mary Jane into breaking up with Peter. After Mary Jane tells Peter she loves "somebody else", Harry meets with Peter and claims to be "the other guy". Peter confronts Harry about forcing Mary Jane to end her relationship with him and spitefully tells Harry that his father never loved him. Another fight ensues, in which Harry throws a pumpkin bomb at Peter, who deflects it back, disfiguring Harry's face.
</p><p>Peter then exposes rival photographer <a href="/wiki/Eddie_Brock" title="Eddie Brock">Eddie Brock</a>, who created fake photos depicting black-suit Spider-Man as a criminal. Peter proves his plagiarism out of spite, which results in their boss, <a href="/wiki/J._Jonah_Jameson" title="J. Jonah Jameson">J. Jonah Jameson</a>, firing Brock, printing out a retraction and giving Brock's job to Peter. Later, to make Mary Jane jealous, Peter brings Gwen to a nightclub, where Mary Jane now works. Realizing this, Gwen leaves the nightclub, and Peter attacks a couple of bouncers, but he accidentally hits Mary Jane. Peter now realizes the symbiote is corrupting him, thanks to MJ. Retreating to a bell tower of a church, Peter removes the symbiote after bumping into a church bell weakens it, which falls below to the floor and bonds with Brock, who in turn, praying for Peter's death, is transformed into <a href="/wiki/Venom_(Marvel_Comics_character)" title="Venom (Marvel Comics character)">Venom</a>. Brock locates Marko and convinces him to join forces to defeat Spider-Man.
</p><p>Posing as a taxi driver, Brock kidnaps Mary Jane, and holds her as bait from a web high above a construction site, while Marko keeps the police at bay. Seeking help, Peter goes to Harry, who rejects him. While Spider-Man battles Brock and Marko, Harry learns the truth about his father's death from his butler, and goes to the construction site to help Peter, resulting in a battle between the four. Harry subdues the Sandman before assisting Peter against Brock. In the ensuing battle, Brock attempts to impale Peter with Harry's glider, but Harry steps in, and is impaled himself. Remembering the symbiote's weakness, Peter assembles a perimeter of metal pipes to create a sonic attack, weakening it, and allowing Peter to separate Brock from the symbiote. Peter activates a pumpkin bomb from Harry's glider and throws it at the symbiote, but Brock, attempting to become Venom again, dives in and is killed along with the symbiote.
</p><p>After the battle, Marko explains that Uncle Ben's death was an accident, and that his uncle was trying to help him. His death has haunted him ever since. Peter forgives Marko, who then leaves. Peter and Mary Jane accompany Harry, who dies peacefully from his injuries. Peter, Mary Jane, and Aunt May attend Harry's funeral. Later, at the nightclub, Peter and Mary Jane reconcile and dance.

He hides his true feelings and tells Mary Jane that they can only be friends. Mary Jane notices how familiar the kiss felt. As Peter leaves the funeral, he recalls Ben's words about responsibility and accepts his new life as Spider-Man.
</p><p>Two years have passed since Norman Osborn's death. <a href="/wiki/Spider-Man" title="Spider-Man">Peter Parker</a>, secretly the superhero Spider-Man, is estranged from both love interest <a href="/wiki/Mary_Jane_Watson" title="Mary Jane Watson">Mary Jane Watson</a> and best friend <a href="/wiki/Harry_Osborn" title="Harry Osborn">Harry Osborn</a>, and discovers his <a href="/wiki/Aunt_May" title="Aunt May">aunt May</a> is facing eviction. 
</p><p>Harry, now head of <a href="/wiki/Oscorp" title="Oscorp">Oscorp</a>'s genetic and scientific research division, is sponsoring a <a href="/wiki/Fusion_power" title="Fusion power">fusion power</a> project by nuclear scientist Otto Octavius, who befriends and mentors Peter. While handling hazardous materials, Octavius wears a harness of powerful <a href="/wiki/Robotic_arm" title="Robotic arm">robotic tentacle arms</a> with <a href="/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a>. During a public demonstration that Peter and Harry attend, a power spike causes the fusion reactor to destabilize. Octavius refuses to shut down the reactor, which goes critical – killing his wife and burning the inhibitor chip blocking the arms from his nervous system. Spider-Man arrives and shuts the experiment down, destroying it in the process.
</p><p>At a hospital, doctors prepare to surgically remove Octavius' harness. Without the inhibitor chip the arms have developed sentience and brutally kill them. Upon regaining consciousness and seeing the carnage, Octavius escapes and takes refuge at a harbor. Becoming increasingly influenced by the arms' AI, he robs a bank to fund a second experiment. Peter and May coincidentally are there, and Octavius takes May hostage. Spider-Man rescues her, but Octavius flees with stolen money.

He abandons his Spider-Man identity, returns to his normal life, and attempts to reconcile with Mary Jane. A garbageman brings Peter's Spider-Man costume to Jameson, who takes credit for driving Spider-Man into hiding. Peter tells May the truth behind his <a href="/wiki/Uncle_Ben" title="Uncle Ben">uncle Ben</a>'s death and how he is responsible. May forgives him, but the rise in <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York City</a> crime rates worries Peter.
</p><p>Requiring the isotope <a href="/wiki/Tritium" title="Tritium">tritium</a> to fuel his reactor, Octavius visits Harry to demand it. Harry agrees in exchange for Spider-Man, whom he believes is responsible for Norman's death. He tells Octavius to seek Peter, who Harry believes is friends with Spider-Man, but tells Octavius not to harm him. Octavius locates Peter, tells him to find Spider-Man, and captures Mary Jane. Her endangerment leads to Peter's powers resurfacing. As Jameson admits he was wrong about Spider-Man, Peter steals his costume back from the <i>Bugle</i> and goes after Octavius.
</p><p>As Spider-Man battles Octavius, they fall onto a <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Subway" title="New York City Subway">New York City Subway</a> train. Octavius sabotages the controls and leaves Spider-Man to save the passengers, which he does at a great physical toll. When he faints from exhaustion, the grateful passengers save him from falling and bring him into the train, seeing his unmasked face but promising to keep their knowledge hidden. In vain, they try to protect him when Octavius returns to capture Spider-Man, whom Octavius delivers to Harry.
</p><p>After giving Octavius the tritium, Harry prepares to kill Spider-Man, only to be shocked to see Peter under the mask. Peter convinces Harry to direct him to Octavius' lair, as bigger things are at stake. Spider-Man arrives at the doctor's waterfront laboratory and attempts to rescue Mary Jane discreetly.

The waitress, Laura Vasquez, tells him that the murderers are Serleena, a <a href="/wiki/Shapeshifting" title="Shapeshifting">shapeshifting</a>, plant-like Kylothian who has taken the form of a lingerie model, and her two-headed servant Scrad. Laura says they were looking for something called the Light of Zartha. J is strongly attracted to Laura, and in violation of MiB rules, does not <a href="/wiki/Neuralyzer" title="Neuralyzer">neuralyze</a> her to erase her memories.
</p><p>J finds that little is known about the Light of Zartha, except that it is immensely powerful. As he investigates the crime, every lead points to his mentor, Agent K, who was neuralyzed upon retirement and remembers nothing of his MiB service. In <a href="/wiki/Truro,_Massachusetts" title="Truro, Massachusetts">Truro, Massachusetts</a>, where K is now the town's <a href="/wiki/Postmaster" title="Postmaster">postmaster</a>, J convinces him by proving that all of his fellow postal workers are aliens. Back in New York City, Serleena and Scrad launch an attack on MiB headquarters before K's neuralyzation can be reversed, but Jack Jeebs has an illegal deneuralyzer in his basement. K regains his memories, but remembers that years before, he neuralyzed himself specifically to erase what he knew of the Light of Zartha, and those memories have not returned. As a precaution, he left himself a series of clues.
</p><p>At the pizzeria, they find a locker key. J hides Laura, who fears for her safety, with worm aliens. The key opens a locker in <a href="/wiki/Grand_Central_Terminal" title="Grand Central Terminal">Grand Central Station</a> where a society of tiny aliens, who worship K as their deity, guard their most sacred relics: K's wristwatch and video store membership card.

After hiding the Light, K neuralyzed himself to ensure that he would never reveal its hiding place. K still cannot remember where he hid it, nor what the Light actually looks like; he only remembers that it must return to Zartha soon, or both Earth and Zartha will be destroyed.
</p><p>At the worms' apartment, they find that Laura has been kidnapped by Serleena, who believes that Laura's bracelet is the Light. J, K, and the worms counterattack MiB headquarters, freeing Laura and the other agents. Serleena attempts to retaliate by chasing them with a spaceship through New York but is eaten by Jeff, a gigantic worm alien living in the <a href="/wiki/New_York_City_Subway" title="New York City Subway">New York City Subway</a>.
</p><p>Laura's bracelet leads J and K to the roof of a skyscraper where a ship stands ready to transport the Light back to Zartha. The two realize Laura is the daughter of Laurana, and is herself the Light. K convinces J and Laura that she must go to Zartha, to save both her planet and Earth from destruction. Serleena, who has assimilated Jeff and taken his form, attempts to snatch the ship carrying Laura as it lifts off, but J and K blast her out of the sky. Since all of New York City has just witnessed this battle in the skies over the metropolis, K activates a giant neuralyzer in the torch of the <a href="/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty" title="Statue of Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>.
</p><p>Back at headquarters, K and Men in Black Chief Zed, hoping to cheer up a heartbroken J, have relocated the tiny locker-dwelling aliens who now worship J to his Men in Black locker. When J suggests showing the miniature creatures that their universe is bigger than a locker, K shows J that the human universe is itself a locker within an immense alien train station.

While searching for Peter, Ben attempts to stop the thief, and is killed. The thief escapes as Peter finds Ben dead on the sidewalk.

After a fall lands him inside an abandoned gym, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Luchador" title="Luchador">luchador</a>-wrestling poster inspires him to create a mask to hide his identity. He adds a <a href="/wiki/Spandex" title="Spandex">spandex</a> suit and builds mechanical devices to attach to his wrists to shoot a biocable "<a href="/wiki/Spider_web" title="Spider web">web</a>".

By the time he gets to the <a href="/wiki/Williamsburg_Bridge" title="Williamsburg Bridge">Williamsburg Bridge</a>, Connors has become a violent hybrid of lizard and man, tossing cars, including Ratha's, over the side. Peter, now calling himself Spider-Man, snatches each falling car with his web-lines.
</p><p>Spider-Man suspects Connors is the Lizard and unsuccessfully confronts the creature in the sewers. The Lizard learns Spider-Man's real identity via the name on an abandoned camera and follows Peter to school, where they fight again. In response Police start a manhunt for both Spider-Man and the Lizard. The Police corner Spider-Man by taking off his mask and Captain Stacy discovers that Spider-Man is really Peter. The Lizard plans to make all humans lizard-like by releasing a chemical cloud from Oscorp's tower, to eliminate the weaknesses he believes plague humanity. Gwen infiltrates Oscorp and creates a cure. Spider-Man then eventually disperses an antidote cloud instead, restoring Connors and earlier victims to normal, but not before the Lizard mortally wounds Captain Stacy. Before his death, Captain Stacy requests Peter avoid Gwen, in order to keep her safe. Peter initially does so, but later at school, suggests to Gwen he may see her after all.

Later, he and his wife, Mary, are aboard a private jet hijacked by an assassin sent to kill Richard and his wife. Richard and Mary fight off the man, but the ensuing struggle causes the plane to crash, killing them both, after he uploads the video.
</p><p>Years later, Richard's son, Peter, continues to fight crime as <a href="/wiki/Spider-Man" title="Spider-Man">Spider-Man</a> in the present day. He pursues and apprehends <a href="/wiki/Rhino_(comics)" title="Rhino (comics)">Aleksei Sytsevich</a> and saves <a href="/wiki/Electro_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Electro (Marvel Comics)">Max Dillion</a> before a taxi hits him. Later, Peter meets with his girlfriend <a href="/wiki/Gwen_Stacy" title="Gwen Stacy">Gwen Stacy</a> at their high school graduation ceremony and, insisting he keep his vow to her late father, ends their relationship. Peter's childhood friend, <a href="/wiki/Harry_Osborn" title="Harry Osborn">Harry Osborn</a>, returns to Manhattan to see his terminally-ill father, <a href="/wiki/Norman_Osborn" title="Norman Osborn">Norman</a>, CEO of OsCorp. Norman explains his illness is genetic, and Harry is at the age where it first develops. Norman gives Harry a small device he claims contains his life's work. The next day, Norman dies, and Harry is appointed the new OsCorp CEO.
</p><p>While working in an OsCorp laboratory, Max inadvertently shocks himself and falls into a tank of genetically-engineered <a href="/wiki/Electric_eel" title="Electric eel">electric eels</a>. They attack him, and he mutates into an organic electric generator. Meanwhile, Peter attempts to maintain a friendship with Gwen, but she reveals that she may move to England for schooling. Before they can discuss it, Dillon wanders into <a href="/wiki/Times_Square" title="Times Square">Times Square</a>, accidentally causing a blackout, and is apprehended by Spider-Man after a battle. Dillon is taken to the Ravencroft Institute, where he is studied by German scientist Dr. Kafka. Meanwhile, the first symptoms of Harry's illness are showing, and he uses the device Norman gave him to deduce that Spider-Man's blood could help save him. He asks Peter, who has been selling photos of Spider-Man to the <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Bugle" title="Daily Bugle">Daily Bugle</a></i>, to aid him in finding Spider-Man. Peter refuses, unsure of what effects the transfusion would have. Although he later comes to Harry as Spider-Man, he still refuses, and Harry becomes resentful towards Spider-Man. OsCorp vice-president Donald Menken frames Harry for covering up Dillon's accident, removes him as CEO and takes control of Oscorp. Harry's assistant, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Felicia_Hardy" title="Felicia Hardy">Felicia Hardy</a>, informs him of equipment that could help him, so he makes a deal with Dillon, who now calls himself "Electro," to get him back inside the OsCorp building. There he finds a suit of armor and other equipment made by Norman, as well as venom from the now-destroyed genetically-altered spiders. The venom accelerates Harry's illness, and transforms him into a <a href="/wiki/Green_Goblin" title="Green Goblin">goblin-like creature</a>, but the suit's built-in emergency protocol restores his health and keeps the transformation from killing him.
</p><p>Peter uses information left by his father to locate the video message in an abandoned subway station's hidden lab. Richard explains that he had to leave because he refused to cooperate with Norman's plans to make biogenetic weapons.

Gwen follows, and together, they restore power, and <a href="/wiki/Overcurrent" title="Overcurrent">overload</a> Electro's body, causing it to explode and kill him.
</p><p>The transformed Harry, who has now gone insane, arrives equipped with Norman's armor and weaponry. Upon seeing Gwen, he deduces Spider-Man's secret identity and, swearing revenge for being refused the blood transfusion, kidnaps her and takes her to the top of a clock tower. Spider-Man defeats Harry, but Gwen falls to her death, despite Spider-Man's attempt to save her. Mourning her death, the depressed Peter ends his career as Spider-Man.
</p><p>Five months later, Harry is coping with the aftereffects of his transformation while incarcerated at Ravencroft. His associate, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Gentleman_(comics)" title="The Gentleman (comics)">Gustav Fiers</a>, visits Harry and the pair discuss forming their own <a href="/wiki/Sinister_Six" title="Sinister Six">team</a>. Harry orders Fiers to start with Sytsevich. Later, an unknown team of men break Sytsevich out of prison. Equipped with an electromechanical suit of armor, Sytsevich calls himself the Rhino and rampages through the streets. Peter, inspired by Gwen's graduation speech, resumes his role as Spider-Man, and confronts him.

One night, after preventing criminals from robbing an ATM with their advanced weapons from Toomes, Parker returns to his <a href="/wiki/Queens" title="Queens">Queens</a> apartment where his best friend Ned discovers his secret identity.

Parker saves Davis before being caught by Toomes and dropped in a lake, nearly drowning after becoming tangled in a parachute built into his suit. He is rescued by Stark, who is monitoring the Spider-Man suit he gave Parker and warns him against further involvement with the criminals. Toomes accidentally kills Brice with one of their weapons, and Schultz becomes the new Shocker.
</p><p>Parker and Ned study a weapon left behind by Brice, removing its power core. When a tracking device on Schultz leads to Maryland, Parker rejoins the decathlon team and accompanies them to Washington, D.C. for their national tournament. Ned and Parker disable the tracker Stark implanted in the Spider-Man suit, and unlock its advanced features. Parker tries to stop Toomes from stealing weapons from a D.O.D.C. truck, but is trapped inside the truck, causing him to miss the decathlon tournament. When he discovers that the power core is an unstable Chitauri grenade, Parker races to the <a href="/wiki/Washington_Monument" title="Washington Monument">Washington Monument</a> where the core explodes and traps Ned and their friends in an elevator.

On the night of the dance, Parker learns that Toomes is Liz’s father. Deducing Parker's secret identity from Liz's account about him, Toomes threatens retaliation if he interferes with his plans. During the dance, Parker realizes Toomes is planning to hijack a D.O.D.C. plane transporting weapons from <a href="/wiki/Stark_Tower" title="Stark Tower">Avengers Tower</a> to the team's new headquarters, dons his old homemade Spider-Man suit and races to Toomes' lair.

Consequently, Weying ends their relationship.
</p><p>Six months later, Drake's symbiosis trials are closer to success, though one of his symbiotes dies due to carelessness. Brock is approached by Dora Skirth, one of Drake's scientists who disagrees with his methods and wants to expose him. She helps Brock break into the research facility to search for evidence, and he learns that an acquaintance of his, a homeless woman named Maria, is one of the test subjects. Brock attempts to rescue Maria, but the symbiote possessing her transfers to his body without him realizing, leaving her dead. Brock escapes and soon begins displaying strange symptoms. He reaches out to Weying for help, and her new boyfriend, Dr. Dan Lewis, discovers the symbiote on examining Brock. Drake exposes Skirth to the remaining captive symbiote, which ultimately dies. This leaves the symbiote inside Brock as the only known surviving specimen.
</p><p>Drake sends mercenaries to retrieve the symbiote from Brock, but it manifests around his body as a monstrous creature that fights off the attackers. It later introduces itself to Brock as <a href="/wiki/Venom_(Marvel_Comics_character)" title="Venom (Marvel Comics character)">Venom</a>, and explains that the comet is searching for planets where the symbiotes can possess and devour the inhabitants. Venom offers to spare Brock if he helps the symbiotes achieve their goal, and Brock comes to enjoy the superhuman attributes that the symbiote imbues him with. Brock breaks into his old workplace to turn in evidence of Drake's crimes, but is surrounded by <a href="/wiki/SWAT" title="SWAT">SWAT</a> officers and is forced to transform to escape. Weying witnesses this transformation and takes Brock back to Lewis's office, where they explain that the symbiote is slowly rotting Brock's internal organs. Brock notes that the symbiote has two weaknesses: high-pitched noises and fire. Although Venom claims that the organ damage can be prevented, Weying uses an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/MRI_machine" title="MRI machine">MRI machine</a> to help Brock separate from the symbiote. Brock is then captured by Drake's men.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the fourth symbiote, <a href="/wiki/Symbiote_(comics)#Supporting_character_symbiotes" title="Symbiote (comics)">Riot</a>, makes its way from Malaysia to San Francisco by hopping from body to body. It bonds with Drake, who agrees to take Riot in a Life Foundation space probe to collect the rest of the symbiotes and bring them to Earth. Weying reluctantly bonds with Venom so they can free Brock. When Brock and Venom are bonded again, the latter states that he has been convinced to help protect the Earth from his kind through his interactions with Brock, and the pair attempt to stop Riot and Drake with Weying's help. Venom damages the probe as it takes off, causing it to explode and kill both Riot and Drake. Weying believes Brock is no longer bonded to Venom after this, and that Venom also died in the explosion. However, the pair remain secretly bonded and set out to protect San Francisco by killing criminals.

Miles flees, but is captured by Prowler and unmasks himself. Unwilling to kill Miles, Aaron is shot by Fisk. But before Fisk can shoot again at Miles to finish him off, Peter webs his gun and knocks him over. Miles flees with Aaron, but Aaron dies of his injuries. Jefferson sees Miles mourning over Aaron and concludes that Spider-Man killed him.
</p><p>The heroes regroup with Miles in his dorm. Peter restrains Miles with his webs to ensure his safety before heading out with the heroes, choosing to sacrifice himself by staying behind and deactivating the collider. Jefferson arrives outside Miles' door and, assuming he does not want to speak to him, apologizes for his mistakes.
</p><p>Miles masters his powers and goes to Aunt May's, where he gains web shooters and repaints Peter's suit. He joins the heroes and helps them defeat Fisk's enforcers before activating the USB drive and sending them home. Fisk and Miles fight throughout the collider, attracting Jefferson's attention. As Miles is nearly killed, Jefferson realizes that Spider-Man is not the enemy and encourages him. Miles paralyzes Fisk with his venom blast and throws him at the kill switch, destroying the collider.
</p><p>Fisk and his enforcers are arrested and Jefferson recognizes Spider-Man as a hero. Miles embraces the responsibilities of his new life.

Long before Bilbo's involvement, the <a href="/wiki/Dwarf_(Middle-earth)" title="Dwarf (Middle-earth)">Dwarf</a> king <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thr%C3%B3r" title="Thrór">Thrór</a> brought an era of prosperity for his kin under the <a href="/wiki/Lonely_Mountain" title="Lonely Mountain">Lonely Mountain</a> until the arrival of the <a href="/wiki/Dragon_(Middle-earth)" title="Dragon (Middle-earth)">dragon</a> <a href="/wiki/Smaug" title="Smaug">Smaug</a>. Destroying the nearby town of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dale_(Middle-earth)" title="Dale (Middle-earth)">Dale</a>, Smaug drove the Dwarves out of their mountain and took their hoard of gold. Thrór's grandson, <a href="/wiki/Thorin_Oakenshield" title="Thorin Oakenshield">Thorin</a>, sees <a href="/wiki/Thranduil" title="Thranduil">King Thranduil</a> and his <a href="/wiki/Silvan_Elves" title="Silvan Elves">Wood-elves</a> on a nearby hillside, and is dismayed when they leave rather than aid his people, resulting in Thorin's everlasting hatred of <a href="/wiki/Elf_(Middle-earth)" title="Elf (Middle-earth)">Elves</a>.
</p><p>In the <a href="/wiki/Shire_(Middle-earth)" title="Shire (Middle-earth)">Shire</a>, 50-year-old Bilbo is tricked by the <a href="/wiki/Wizard_(Middle-earth)" title="Wizard (Middle-earth)">wizard</a> <a href="/wiki/Gandalf" title="Gandalf">Gandalf the Grey</a> into hosting a party for Thorin and his company of Dwarves: <a href="/wiki/Balin_(Middle-earth)" title="Balin (Middle-earth)">Balin</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dwalin" title="Dwalin">Dwalin</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/F%C3%ADli" title="Fíli">Fíli</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/K%C3%ADli" title="Kíli">Kíli</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dori_(Middle-earth)" title="Dori (Middle-earth)">Dori</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nori_(Middle-earth)" title="Nori (Middle-earth)">Nori</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ori_(dwarf)" title="Ori (dwarf)">Ori</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/%C3%93in,_son_of_Gl%C3%B3in" title="Óin, son of Glóin">Óin</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gl%C3%B3in" title="Glóin">Glóin</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bifur" title="Bifur">Bifur</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bofur" title="Bofur">Bofur</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bombur_(Middle-earth)" title="Bombur (Middle-earth)">Bombur</a>. Gandalf's aim is to recruit Bilbo as the company's "burglar" to aid them in their quest to enter the Lonely Mountain. Bilbo is unwilling to accept at first, but has a change of heart after the company leaves without him the next day. Travelling onward, the company is captured by three <a href="/wiki/Troll_(Middle-earth)" title="Troll (Middle-earth)">Trolls</a>. Bilbo stalls the Trolls from eating them until dawn, and Gandalf exposes the trolls to sunlight, turning them to stone. The company locates the Trolls' cave and finds treasure and Elven blades. Thorin and Gandalf each take an Elf-made blade, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Orcrist" title="Orcrist">Orcrist</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Glamdring" title="Glamdring">Glamdring</a>, respectively; Gandalf also finds an <a href="/wiki/Sting_(Middle-earth)" title="Sting (Middle-earth)">Elven dagger</a>, which he gives to Bilbo.
</p><p>The wizard <a href="/wiki/Radagast" title="Radagast">Radagast the Brown</a> finds Gandalf and the company, and recounts an encounter at <a href="/wiki/Dol_Guldur" title="Dol Guldur">Dol Guldur</a> with the <a href="/wiki/Sauron" title="Sauron">Necromancer</a>, a sorcerer who has been corrupting <a href="/wiki/Mirkwood" title="Mirkwood">Greenwood</a> with dark magic. Chased by <a href="/wiki/Orc_(Middle-earth)" title="Orc (Middle-earth)">Orcs</a>, Gandalf leads the company through a hidden passage to <a href="/wiki/Rivendell" title="Rivendell">Rivendell</a>. There, <a href="/wiki/Elrond" title="Elrond">Lord Elrond</a> discloses a hidden indication of a secret door on the company's map of the Lonely Mountain, which will be visible only on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Durin%27s_Day" title="Durin's Day">Durin's Day</a>. Gandalf later approaches the <a href="/wiki/White_Council" title="White Council">White Council</a> — consisting of Elrond, <a href="/wiki/Galadriel" title="Galadriel">Galadriel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Saruman" title="Saruman">Saruman the White</a> — and presents a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Morgul_blade" title="Morgul blade">Morgul blade</a>, a weapon of the <a href="/wiki/Witch-king_of_Angmar" title="Witch-king of Angmar">Witch-king of Angmar</a>, which Radagast obtained from Dol Guldur as a sign that the Necromancer is linked to an eventual return of <a href="/wiki/Sauron" title="Sauron">Sauron</a>. While Saruman presses concern to the more present matter of the Dwarves' quest, requesting that Gandalf put an end to it, Gandalf secretly reveals to Galadriel he had anticipated this and had the Dwarves move forward without him.
</p><p>The company journeys into the <a href="/wiki/Misty_Mountains" title="Misty Mountains">Misty Mountains</a>, where they find themselves amid a colossal battle between <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Giant_(mythology)" title="Giant (mythology)">Stone Giants</a>. They take refuge in a cave and are captured by <a href="/wiki/Orc_(Middle-earth)" title="Orc (Middle-earth)">Goblins</a>, who take them to their leader, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Great_Goblin" title="Great Goblin">Great Goblin</a>. Bilbo becomes separated from the Dwarves and falls into a crevice where he encounters <a href="/wiki/Gollum" title="Gollum">Gollum</a>, who unknowingly drops a <a href="/wiki/One_Ring" title="One Ring">golden ring</a>. Pocketing the ring, Bilbo finds himself confronted by Gollum. They play a riddle game, wagering that Bilbo will be shown the way out if he wins or eaten by Gollum if he loses. Bilbo eventually wins by asking Gollum what he has in his pocket. Noticing his ring is lost, Gollum realizes that Bilbo possesses it and chases him. Bilbo discovers that the ring grants him invisibility, but when he has a chance to kill Gollum, Bilbo spares his life out of pity and escapes while Gollum shouts his hatred towards the hobbit Baggins.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the Great Goblin reveals to the Dwarves that <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Azog" title="Azog">Azog</a>, an Orc war-chief who killed Thrór and lost his forearm to Thorin in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/War_of_the_Dwarves_and_Orcs" title="War of the Dwarves and Orcs">battle</a> outside the Dwarven kingdom of <a href="/wiki/Moria_(Middle-earth)" title="Moria (Middle-earth)">Moria</a>, has placed a bounty on Thorin's head. Gandalf arrives and leads the Dwarves in an escape, killing the Great Goblin. Bilbo exits the mountain and rejoins the company, keeping his newly obtained ring secret. The company is ambushed by Azog and his hunting party, and takes refuge in trees. Thorin charges at Azog, who overpowers and severely injures him with his <a href="/wiki/Warg_(Middle-earth)" title="Warg (Middle-earth)">Warg</a>. Bilbo saves Thorin from the Orcs just as the company is rescued by <a href="/wiki/Eagle_(Middle-earth)" title="Eagle (Middle-earth)">eagles</a>. They escape to the safety of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Carrock#Carrock" title="Carrock">Carrock</a> where Gandalf revives Thorin, who renounces his previous disdain for Bilbo after being saved by him. 
</p><p>They see the Lonely Mountain in the distance, where a sleeping Smaug is awoken by a thrush knocking a snail against a stone.
</p><p>Thorin and his company are being pursued by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Azog" title="Azog">Azog</a> and his <a href="/wiki/Orc_(Middle-earth)" title="Orc (Middle-earth)">Orc</a> party following the events of <a href="/wiki/The_Hobbit:_An_Unexpected_Journey#Plot" title="The Hobbit: An Unexpected Journey">the previous film</a>.  They are ushered along by Gandalf to the nearby home of <a href="/wiki/Beorn" title="Beorn">Beorn</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Shapeshifting" title="Shapeshifting">skin-changer</a> who can take the form of the bear. That night, Azog is summoned to <a href="/wiki/Dol_Guldur" title="Dol Guldur">Dol Guldur</a> by the Necromancer, who commands him to marshal his forces for war, so Azog delegates the hunt for Thorin to his son <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bolg" title="Bolg">Bolg</a>. The following day, Beorn escorts the company to the borders of <a href="/wiki/Mirkwood" title="Mirkwood">Mirkwood</a>, where Gandalf discovers <a href="/wiki/Black_Speech" title="Black Speech">Black Speech</a> imprinted on an old ruin. Heeding a promise he made to <a href="/wiki/Galadriel" title="Galadriel">Galadriel</a>, he warns the company to remain on the path and leaves to investigate the tombs of the <a href="/wiki/Nazg%C3%BBl" title="Nazgûl">Nazgûl</a>. Upon entering the forest, the dwarves lose their way and are ensnared by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Great_Spiders_of_Mirkwood" title="Great Spiders of Mirkwood">giant spiders</a>. Bilbo sets about freeing them with the help of his recently acquired <a href="/wiki/One_Ring" title="One Ring">invisibility ring</a>. He subsequently drops the ring and first begins to understand its dark influence after he brutally kills a creature to retrieve it.
</p><p>The remaining spiders are fended off by the <a href="/wiki/Silvan_Elves" title="Silvan Elves">Wood-elves</a> led by <a href="/wiki/Tauriel" title="Tauriel">Tauriel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Legolas" title="Legolas">Legolas</a>. They also capture the Dwarves and bring Thorin before their king <a href="/wiki/Thranduil" title="Thranduil">Thranduil</a>. Thorin confronts Thranduil about his neglect of the Dwarves of Erebor following <a href="/wiki/Smaug" title="Smaug">Smaug</a>'s attack 60 years earlier, and is consequently imprisoned with the other Dwarves. Bilbo, having avoided capture, arranges an escape using empty wine barrels that are sent downstream. While being pursued by the Wood-elves, they are ambushed by Bolg and his Orc party, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/K%C3%ADli" title="Kíli">Kíli</a> is wounded with a <a href="/wiki/Middle-earth_weapons_and_armour#Knives" title="Middle-earth weapons and armour">Morgul shaft</a>. They engage in a running three-way battle down the river, but ultimately the Dwarves are able to escape both groups of pursuers. Thranduil then seals off his kingdom when an Orc captive reveals an evil entity has returned and is amassing an army in the south, but Tauriel decides to leave and assist the Dwarves, and Legolas goes after her. Meanwhile, Gandalf and <a href="/wiki/Radagast" title="Radagast">Radagast</a> go to investigate the tombs of the <a href="/wiki/Nazg%C3%BBl" title="Nazgûl">Nazgûl</a>, which they find to be empty.
</p><p>The company are smuggled into <a href="/wiki/Esgaroth" title="Esgaroth">Esgaroth</a> by a bargeman called <a href="/wiki/Bard_the_Bowman" title="Bard the Bowman">Bard</a>, but are discovered raiding the town armory for new weapons. Thorin promises the Master, his councilor Alfrid, and the people of Laketown a share of the mountain's treasure, and it is revealed that Bard is a descendant of the last ruler of Dale, and possesses the last black arrow capable of killing Smaug. Kíli is forced to remain behind, tended to by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_Middle-earth_Dwarves#Fíli" title="List of Middle-earth Dwarves">Fíli</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_Middle-earth_Dwarves#Óin,_son_of_Glóin" title="List of Middle-earth Dwarves">Óin</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_Middle-earth_Dwarves#Bofur" title="List of Middle-earth Dwarves">Bofur</a>, as the remaining company receive a grand farewell. Meanwhile, Gandalf travels south to the ruins of <a href="/wiki/Dol_Guldur" title="Dol Guldur">Dol Guldur</a>, while Radagast leaves to warn <a href="/wiki/Galadriel" title="Galadriel">Galadriel</a> of their discovery at the tombs of the Nazgûl. Gandalf finds the ruins infested with Orcs and is ambushed by Azog. The Necromancer overpowers Gandalf and reveals himself as <a href="/wiki/Sauron" title="Sauron">Sauron</a>.
</p><p>Thorin and his remaining company reach the <a href="/wiki/Lonely_Mountain" title="Lonely Mountain">Lonely Mountain</a>, where Bilbo discovers the hidden entrance. He is sent in to retrieve the Arkenstone, and while doing so, he accidentally awakens Smaug. While trying to find Bilbo, Smaug reveals his knowledge of Sauron's return. Back in Laketown, Bard attempts to bring the black arrow to the town's launcher, as he fears what may happen when the Dwarves enter the mountain. However, he is arrested by the Master and Alfrid in the process and leaves his son to hide the arrow. Bolg and his Orc party infiltrate the town and attack the four Dwarves, but are quickly dispatched by Tauriel and Legolas. Tauriel then tends to Kíli, while Legolas leaves in pursuit of Bolg. Meanwhile, Gandalf watches helplessly as Azog and an Orc army march from Dol Guldur towards the Lonely Mountain.
</p><p>Back inside the mountain, during a long chase, Bilbo and the Dwarves rekindle the mountain's forge using Smaug's flames to create and melt a large golden statue of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Thr%C3%B3r" title="Thrór">Thrór</a>, hoping to bury Smaug alive in the molten gold. They do so, but Smaug emerges from the gold, storms out of the mountain and <a href="/wiki/The_Hobbit:_The_Battle_of_the_Five_Armies" title="The Hobbit: The Battle of the Five Armies">flies off to destroy Laketown</a> as Bilbo watches in horror.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins" title="Bilbo Baggins">Bilbo</a> and the Dwarves watch from the <a href="/wiki/Lonely_Mountain" title="Lonely Mountain">Lonely Mountain</a> as the dragon <a href="/wiki/Smaug" title="Smaug">Smaug</a> sets <a href="/wiki/Esgaroth" title="Esgaroth">Laketown</a> ablaze. <a href="/wiki/Bard_the_Bowman" title="Bard the Bowman">Bard</a> breaks out of prison, and eventually kills Smaug with the <a href="/wiki/Middle-earth_weapons_and_armour#Black_Arrow" title="Middle-earth weapons and armour">black arrow</a> brought to him by his son <a href="/wiki/List_of_kings_of_Dale" title="List of kings of Dale">Bain</a>. Smaug's falling body crushes the fleeing Master of Laketown and his cronies, who were escaping on a boat laden with the town's gold. Bard reluctantly becomes the new leader of the people of Laketown, with the Master's conniving servant, Alfrid, acting as Bard's reluctant servant, as they seek refuge in the ruins of Dale, while <a href="/wiki/Legolas" title="Legolas">Legolas</a> travels to investigate <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_minor_places_in_Middle-earth#Mount_Gundabad" title="List of minor places in Middle-earth">Mount Gundabad</a> with <a href="/wiki/Tauriel" title="Tauriel">Tauriel</a>. Thorin, now struck with "dragon sickness" over the vast treasure in the mountain, searches obsessively for the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arkenstone" title="Arkenstone">Arkenstone</a>, which Bilbo had previously found but kept hidden. Thorin, hearing that Laketown survivors have fled to Dale, orders the entrance of the Lonely Mountain sealed off.
</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Galadriel" title="Galadriel">Galadriel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elrond" title="Elrond">Elrond</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Saruman" title="Saruman">Saruman</a> arrive at <a href="/wiki/Dol_Guldur" title="Dol Guldur">Dol Guldur</a> and free <a href="/wiki/Gandalf" title="Gandalf">Gandalf</a>, sending him to safety with <a href="/wiki/Radagast" title="Radagast">Radagast</a>. They battle and defeat the <a href="/wiki/Nazg%C3%BBl" title="Nazgûl">Nazgûl</a> and a formless <a href="/wiki/Sauron" title="Sauron">Sauron</a> himself, banishing them to the East. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Azog" title="Azog">Azog</a>, marching on Erebor with his vast Orc army, sends his son <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bolg" title="Bolg">Bolg</a> to Gundabad to summon their second army. Legolas and Tauriel witness the march of Bolg's army, bolstered by Orc berserkers and giant bats.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Thranduil" title="Thranduil">Thranduil</a> and an Elf army arrive in Dale and form an alliance with Bard in order to reclaim a treasure once withheld from them by <a href="/wiki/Middle-earth_dwarf_characters#Thrór" title="Middle-earth dwarf characters">Thrór</a>. Bard goes to the mountain and asks Thorin for the share of gold that he had previously promised the people of Laketown, but Thorin refuses. Gandalf arrives at Dale to warn Bard and Thranduil of the threat posed by Azog, but Thranduil dismisses him. Bilbo sneaks out of Erebor to hand the Arkenstone over to Thranduil and Bard so that they can trade it for the treasures they were promised and prevent a battle. When Bard's and Thranduil's armies gather at the gates of Erebor, offering to trade the Arkenstone for the promised treasures, Thorin angrily refuses to believe they have the Arkenstone until Bilbo admits giving it away and chides Thorin for letting greed cloud his judgement. Outraged by what he sees as betrayal, Thorin nearly kills Bilbo, but Gandalf appears and shames Thorin into releasing Bilbo. Thorin's cousin <a href="/wiki/D%C3%A1in_II_Ironfoot" title="Dáin II Ironfoot">Dáin</a> arrives with his Dwarf army, and a battle of Dwarves against Elves and Men ensues, until <a href="/wiki/Wereworms" title="Wereworms">Wereworms</a> emerge from the ground, releasing Azog's army from their tunnels. With the Orcs outnumbering Dáin's army, Thranduil and Bard's forces, along with Gandalf and Bilbo, join the battle, fighting the Orcs. However, a second front is opened when many Orcs, Ogres, and Trolls attack Dale, forcing Bard to withdraw his forces to defend the city, while Alfrid takes a bunch of gold and flees from Dale to his ultimate fate.
</p><p>Inside Erebor, Thorin suffers traumatic hallucinations before regaining his sanity and leading his company to join the battle. He rides towards <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ravenhill_(Middle-earth)" title="Ravenhill (Middle-earth)">Ravenhill</a> with Dwalin, Fíli, and Kíli to kill Azog; Bilbo follows them, using <a href="/wiki/One_Ring" title="One Ring">his magic ring</a> to move through the combat unseen. Meanwhile, Tauriel and Legolas arrive to warn the Dwarves of Bolg's approaching army. Fíli is captured, and Azog kills him as Bilbo and the other Dwarves are forced to watch. As Thorin engages Azog in a fight to the death, Bolg knocks Bilbo unconscious, overpowers Tauriel and then kills Kíli, who had come to her aid. Legolas battles Bolg and eventually kills him. Thorin kills Azog, but is fatally wounded in the process. The <a href="/wiki/Eagle_(Middle-earth)" title="Eagle (Middle-earth)">Great Eagles</a> arrive with Radagast and <a href="/wiki/Beorn" title="Beorn">Beorn</a> to fight the newly arriving Orc army, and the Orcs are finally defeated. Bilbo regains consciousness and makes peace with the dying Thorin. Tauriel mourns Kili, and Thranduil acknowledges their love. Legolas then tells Thranduil he must leave, and Thranduil advises him to seek out a Dunedain ranger in the north who goes by the name <a href="/wiki/Aragorn" title="Aragorn">"Strider"</a>.
</p><p>As Thorin's company begin settling back into Erebor (with Dáin now the king), and Dale begins to recover with Bard as the leader, Bilbo bids farewell to the company's remaining members and journeys home to <a href="/wiki/Shire_(Middle-earth)" title="Shire (Middle-earth)">the Shire</a> with Gandalf. As the two part ways on the outskirts of the Shire, Gandalf admits his knowledge of Bilbo's ring and warns him that magic rings are not to be used lightly. Bilbo returns to Bag End to find his belongings being auctioned off because he was presumed dead. He cancels the sale, but finds his home pillaged; he starts to tidy up and to settle back in. <a href="/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings:_The_Fellowship_of_the_Ring" title="The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring">Sixty years later</a>, Bilbo receives a visit from Gandalf on his 111th birthday.
</p><p>Two <a href="/wiki/Hobbit" title="Hobbit">Hobbits</a>, Sméagol and <a href="/wiki/D%C3%A9agol" title="Déagol">Déagol</a>, are fishing when Déagol discovers the <a href="/wiki/One_Ring" title="One Ring">One Ring</a> in the river. Sméagol is ensnared by the Ring, and kills his friend for it. He retreats into the <a href="/wiki/Misty_Mountains" title="Misty Mountains">Misty Mountains</a> as the Ring twists his body and mind, until he becomes the creature <a href="/wiki/Gollum" title="Gollum">Gollum</a>.

Gandalf retrieves the defeated <a href="/wiki/Saruman" title="Saruman">Saruman</a>'s <i><a href="/wiki/Palant%C3%ADr" title="Palantír">palantír</a></i>. Pippin later looks into the seeing-stone, and is telepathically attacked by <a href="/wiki/Sauron" title="Sauron">Sauron</a>. Gandalf deduces that Sauron will attack <a href="/wiki/Gondor" title="Gondor">Gondor</a>'s capital <a href="/wiki/Minas_Tirith" title="Minas Tirith">Minas Tirith</a>. He rides there to warn Gondor's steward <a href="/wiki/Denethor" title="Denethor">Denethor</a>, taking Pippin with him.

Frodo tells Sam to go home, before Frodo and Gollum continue to the tunnel leading to Mordor, where Gollum tricks him into venturing into the lair of the giant spider <a href="/wiki/Shelob" title="Shelob">Shelob</a>. Frodo narrowly escapes and confronts Gollum, telling him that he must destroy the Ring for both their sakes. Gollum attacks Frodo, but falls down a chasm.

Faramir is gravely wounded after a futile effort to retake Osgiliath; believing his son to be dead, Denethor falls into madness. Gandalf is left to defend the city against the Orc army, led by <a href="/wiki/Gothmog_(Third_Age)" title="Gothmog (Third Age)">Gothmog</a>. As Gothmog's army forces its way into the city, Denethor attempts to kill himself and Faramir on a <a href="/wiki/Pyre" title="Pyre">pyre</a>. Pippin alerts Gandalf and they save Faramir, but a burning Denethor leaps to his death from the top of Minas Tirith just before Théoden and his nephew, <a href="/wiki/%C3%89omer" title="Éomer">Éomer</a>, arrive with the Rohirrim.

Frodo succumbs to the Ring and claims it as his own. Gollum attacks Frodo and bites his finger off to reclaim the Ring. Frodo fights back and knocks Gollum, who is holding the Ring, into the volcano, destroying the Ring and killing Gollum. As Frodo and Sam escape, Sauron is destroyed and Mordor crumbles. Gandalf flies in with <a href="/wiki/Eagle_(Middle-earth)" title="Eagle (Middle-earth)">eagles</a> to rescue the Hobbits, who awaken later in Minas Tirith and are reunited with the surviving Fellowship members.

The Uruk-hai are ambushed by the Rohirrim, the exiled army of <a href="/wiki/Rohan_(Middle-earth)" title="Rohan (Middle-earth)">Rohan</a>, while the two <a href="/wiki/Hobbit" title="Hobbit">Hobbits</a> escape into <a href="/wiki/Fangorn" title="Fangorn">Fangorn</a> Forest and encounter the <a href="/wiki/Ent" title="Ent">Ent</a> <a href="/wiki/Treebeard" title="Treebeard">Treebeard</a>.

</p><p>Aragorn's group travels to Rohan's capital city Edoras, where Gandalf releases Théoden from Saruman's influence and Wormtongue is banished. After learning about Saruman's plans to wipe out Rohan with his Uruk-hai army, Théoden decides to move his citizens to <a href="/wiki/Helm%27s_Deep" title="Helm's Deep">Helm's Deep</a>, an ancient fortress that has provided refuge to Rohan's people in times past, while Gandalf departs to acquire the aid of the Rohirrim. Aragorn builds a friendship with Théoden's niece, <a href="/wiki/%C3%89owyn" title="Éowyn">Éowyn</a>, who quickly becomes infatuated with him. When the exodus comes under attack by <a href="/wiki/Warg_(Middle-earth)" title="Warg (Middle-earth)">Warg</a>-riding Orcs, Aragorn falls off a cliff into a river and is presumed dead. However, he is found by his horse <a href="/wiki/List_of_Middle-earth_animals#Brego" title="List of Middle-earth animals">Brego</a> and taken to Helm's Deep. The Uruk-hai army arrives at Helm's Deep that night, finding a makeshift army of civilians and Elves from <a href="/wiki/Lothl%C3%B3rien" title="Lothlórien">Lothlórien</a> waiting for them as a night-long battle follows. Using gunpowder-like explosives on a sewer drain that Wormtongue told Saruman about, the Uruk-hai breach the outer wall and force the remaining defenders to retreat into the inner castle.
</p><p>At Fangorn, Merry and Pippin, having met Gandalf in the forest and convincing Treebeard they were allies, are brought to an Ent Council where the Ents decide not to assist in the war. Pippin then tells Treebeard to take them to a route passing <a href="/wiki/Isengard" title="Isengard">Isengard</a>, where they witness the devastation caused to the forest by Saruman's war efforts. An enraged Treebeard summons the Ents and they storm Isengard, drowning the orcs by breaking their river dam and stranding Saruman in Orthanc. 
</p><p>At Helm's Deep, Aragorn convinces a despairing Theoden to ride out and meet the Uruks in one last charge. Gandalf and the Rohirrim then arrive at sunrise, turning the tide of the battle and decimating the Uruk-hai while those remaining flee and are slaughtered. Despite this victory, Gandalf warns that Sauron's retaliation will be terrible and swift.
</p><p>Meanwhile, becoming loyal to Frodo after taking him and Sam through the <a href="/wiki/Dead_Marshes" title="Dead Marshes">Dead Marshes</a>, Gollum convinces the Hobbits of another entrance besides the <a href="/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth" title="Minor places in Middle-earth">Black Gate</a>. Frodo and Sam are later captured by the <a href="/wiki/Rangers_of_Ithilien" title="Rangers of Ithilien">Rangers of Ithilien</a> led by <a href="/wiki/Faramir" title="Faramir">Faramir</a>, brother of the late <a href="/wiki/Boromir" title="Boromir">Boromir</a>. After torturing Gollum while inadvertently instilling in him the notion that he has been betrayed when Frodo saves him from being killed, Faramir learns of the One Ring and takes his captives with him to <a href="/wiki/Gondor" title="Gondor">Gondor</a> to win his father's respect. While passing through the besieged Gondorian city of <a href="/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth" title="Minor places in Middle-earth">Osgiliath</a>, Sam reveals that Boromir's death was because he was driven mad by and tried to take the Ring. An attacking <a href="/wiki/Nazg%C3%BBl" title="Nazgûl">Nazgûl</a> nearly captures Frodo, who momentarily attacks Sam before coming to his senses, forcing Sam to remind him that they are fighting for the good still left in Middle-earth. Faramir is impressed by Frodo's rekindled hope and releases them along with Gollum. While leading the hobbits once more, Gollum decides to take revenge on Frodo and reclaim the ring by leading the group to "<a href="/wiki/Shelob" title="Shelob">Her</a>" upon arriving at <a href="/wiki/Minor_places_in_Middle-earth" title="Minor places in Middle-earth">Cirith Ungol</a>.
</p><p>In the Second Age of <a href="/wiki/Middle-earth" title="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a>, the lords of <a href="/wiki/Elf_(Middle-earth)" title="Elf (Middle-earth)">Elves</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dwarf_(Middle-earth)" title="Dwarf (Middle-earth)">Dwarves</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Man_(Middle-earth)" title="Man (Middle-earth)">Men</a> are given <a href="/wiki/Rings_of_Power" title="Rings of Power">Rings of Power</a>. Unbeknownst to them, the <a href="/wiki/Sauron" title="Sauron">Dark Lord Sauron</a> forges the <a href="/wiki/One_Ring" title="One Ring">One Ring</a> in <a href="/wiki/Mount_Doom" title="Mount Doom">Mount Doom</a>, infusing into it a great part of his power to dominate, through it and at a distance, the other Rings, so he might conquer Middle-earth. A final alliance of men and elves battles Sauron's forces in <a href="/wiki/Mordor" title="Mordor">Mordor</a>, where Prince <a href="/wiki/Isildur" title="Isildur">Isildur</a> of <a href="/wiki/Gondor" title="Gondor">Gondor</a> severs Sauron's finger, and the Ring with it, thereby destroying his physical form. With Sauron's first defeat, the Third Age of Middle-earth begins. Unfortunately, the Ring's influence corrupts Isildur, and, rather than destroy the Ring, Isildur takes it for himself. Isildur is later killed by <a href="/wiki/Orc_(Middle-earth)" title="Orc (Middle-earth)">Orcs</a>, and the Ring is lost for 2,500 years, until it is found by <a href="/wiki/Gollum" title="Gollum">Gollum</a>, who owns it for five centuries. The Ring is then found by a <a href="/wiki/Hobbit" title="Hobbit">hobbit</a> named <a href="/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins" title="Bilbo Baggins">Bilbo Baggins</a>.
</p><p>Sixty years later, Bilbo celebrates his 111th birthday in the <a href="/wiki/Shire_(Middle-earth)" title="Shire (Middle-earth)">Shire</a>, reuniting with his old friend, <a href="/wiki/Gandalf" title="Gandalf">Gandalf the Grey</a>. Bilbo reveals that he intends to leave the Shire for one last adventure, and he leaves his inheritance, including the Ring, to his nephew, <a href="/wiki/Frodo_Baggins" title="Frodo Baggins">Frodo</a>. Although Bilbo has begun to become corrupted by the Ring and tries to keep it for himself, Gandalf intervenes. Gandalf, suspicious of the Ring, tells Frodo to keep it secret and to keep it safe. Gandalf then investigates the Ring, discovers its true identity, and returns to warn Frodo. Gandalf also learns that Gollum was tortured by Orcs, and that Gollum uttered two words during his torture: "Shire" and "Baggins." Gandalf instructs Frodo to leave the Shire, accompanied by his gardener <a href="/wiki/Samwise_Gamgee" title="Samwise Gamgee">Samwise Gamgee</a>. Gandalf rides to <a href="/wiki/Isengard" title="Isengard">Isengard</a> to meet with fellow wizard <a href="/wiki/Saruman" title="Saruman">Saruman</a> the White, but learns that he has joined forces with Sauron, who has unleashed the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ringwraith" title="Ringwraith">Ringwraiths</a> to find Frodo. After a brief battle, Saruman imprisons Gandalf. Frodo and Sam are joined by fellow hobbits <a href="/wiki/Meriadoc_Brandybuck" title="Meriadoc Brandybuck">Merry</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peregrin_Took" title="Peregrin Took">Pippin</a>, and they evade the Ringwraiths, arriving in <a href="/wiki/Bree_(Middle-earth)" title="Bree (Middle-earth)">Bree</a>, where they are meant to meet Gandalf. However, Gandalf never arrives, and they are instead aided by a ranger named <a href="/wiki/Aragorn" title="Aragorn">Strider</a>, a friend of Gandalf's, who escorts them to <a href="/wiki/Rivendell" title="Rivendell">Rivendell</a>.
</p><p>The hobbits are ambushed by the Ringwraiths, and one stabs Frodo with a cursed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Morgul_blade" title="Morgul blade">Morgul blade</a>. <a href="/wiki/Arwen" title="Arwen">Arwen</a>, an elf and Strider's betrothed, comes to Frodo's aid and successfully takes him to Rivendell, where he is healed. Frodo meets Gandalf, who escaped Isengard on the back of a giant <a href="/wiki/Eagle_(Middle-earth)" title="Eagle (Middle-earth)">Eagle</a>. Arwen's father, <a href="/wiki/Elrond" title="Elrond">Lord Elrond,</a> holds a council that decides the Ring must be destroyed in Mount Doom. While the members argue, Frodo volunteers to take the Ring, accompanied by Gandalf, Sam, Merry, Pippin, elf <a href="/wiki/Legolas" title="Legolas">Legolas</a>, dwarf <a href="/wiki/Gimli_(Middle-earth)" title="Gimli (Middle-earth)">Gimli</a>, <a href="/wiki/Boromir" title="Boromir">Boromir</a> of Gondor, and Strider, who is revealed to be Aragorn, Isildur's heir and the rightful King of Gondor. Bilbo gives Frodo his sword, Sting. The Fellowship of the Ring sets off, but Saruman's magic forces them to travel through the Mines of <a href="/wiki/Moria_(Middle-earth)" title="Moria (Middle-earth)">Moria</a>, much to Gandalf's displeasure.
</p><p>The Fellowship discovers that the dwarves within Moria have been slain, and they are attacked by Orcs and a cave <a href="/wiki/Troll" title="Troll">troll</a>. They defeat them, but are confronted by an ancient demon called a <a href="/wiki/Balrog" title="Balrog">Balrog</a>. Gandalf casts the Balrog into a vast chasm, but it drags Gandalf down into the darkness with it. The rest of the Fellowship, now commanded by Aragorn, reaches <a href="/wiki/Lothl%C3%B3rien" title="Lothlórien">Lothlórien</a>, home to elves <a href="/wiki/Galadriel" title="Galadriel">Galadriel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Celeborn" title="Celeborn">Celeborn</a>. Galadriel privately informs Frodo that only he can complete the quest, and that one of his friends will try to take the Ring. Meanwhile, Saruman creates an army of <a href="/wiki/Uruk-hai" title="Uruk-hai">Uruk-hai</a> to track down and kill the Fellowship.
</p><p>The Fellowship leaves Lothlórien by river to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Parth_Galen" title="Parth Galen">Parth Galen</a>. Frodo wanders off and is confronted by Boromir, who tries to take the Ring in desperation. Afraid of the Ring corrupting his friends, Frodo decides to travel to Mordor alone. The Fellowship is then ambushed by the Uruk-hai. Merry and Pippin are taken captive, and Boromir is mortally wounded by the Uruk chieftain, Lurtz. Aragorn arrives and slays Lurtz, and watches Boromir die peacefully. Sam follows Frodo, accompanying him to keep his promise to Gandalf to protect Frodo, while Aragorn, Legolas, and Gimli go to rescue Merry and Pippin.
</p><p>Early in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Second_Age" title="Second Age">Second Age</a> of <a href="/wiki/Middle-earth" title="Middle-earth">Middle-earth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Elf_(Middle-earth)" title="Elf (Middle-earth)">elven</a> smiths forge nine <a href="/wiki/Rings_of_Power" title="Rings of Power">Rings of Power</a> for mortal <a href="/wiki/Man_(Middle-earth)" title="Man (Middle-earth)">men</a>, seven for the <a href="/wiki/Dwarf_(Middle-earth)" title="Dwarf (Middle-earth)">Dwarf-Lords</a>, and three for the Elf-Kings. Soon after, the Dark Lord <a href="/wiki/Sauron" title="Sauron">Sauron</a> makes the <a href="/wiki/One_Ring" title="One Ring">One Ring</a>, and uses it to attempt to conquer Middle-earth. Following the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Last_Alliance_of_Elves_and_Men" title="Last Alliance of Elves and Men">Last Alliance of Elves and Men</a>'s fall, the Ring is seized by Prince <a href="/wiki/Isildur" title="Isildur">Isildur</a>; and after Isildur was killed by <a href="/wiki/Orc_(Middle-earth)" title="Orc (Middle-earth)">orcs</a>, the Ring lies at the bottom of the river <a href="/wiki/Anduin" title="Anduin">Anduin</a> for over 2,500 years. Over time, Sauron captures the Nine Rings and transforms their owners into the <a href="/wiki/Nazg%C3%BBl" title="Nazgûl">Ringwraiths</a>. The One Ring is discovered by <a href="/wiki/D%C3%A9agol" title="Déagol">Déagol</a>, whose cousin, Sméagol, kills him and takes the Ring for himself. The Ring twists his body and mind, and he becomes the creature <a href="/wiki/Gollum" title="Gollum">Gollum</a> (<a href="/wiki/Peter_Woodthorpe" title="Peter Woodthorpe">Peter Woodthorpe</a>). Hundreds of years later, <a href="/wiki/Bilbo_Baggins" title="Bilbo Baggins">Bilbo Baggins</a> (<a href="/wiki/Norman_Bird" title="Norman Bird">Norman Bird</a>) finds the Ring in Gollum's cave and takes it back to the <a href="/wiki/Shire_(Middle-earth)" title="Shire (Middle-earth)">Shire</a>.
</p><p>Decades later, during Bilbo's birthday celebration, the wizard <a href="/wiki/Gandalf" title="Gandalf">Gandalf</a> (<a href="/wiki/William_Squire" title="William Squire">William Squire</a>) tells him to leave the Ring for his relative <a href="/wiki/Frodo_Baggins" title="Frodo Baggins">Frodo</a> (<a href="/wiki/Christopher_Guard" title="Christopher Guard">Christopher Guard</a>). Bilbo reluctantly agrees, and leaves the Shire. Seventeen years pass, during which Gandalf learns that evil forces have discovered that the Ring is in the possession of a Baggins. Gandalf meets with Frodo to explain the Ring's history and the danger it poses; and Frodo leaves his home, taking the Ring with him. He is accompanied by three hobbit friends, <a href="/wiki/Peregrin_Took" title="Peregrin Took">Pippin</a> (<a href="/wiki/Dominic_Guard" title="Dominic Guard">Dominic Guard</a>), <a href="/wiki/Meriadoc_Brandybuck" title="Meriadoc Brandybuck">Merry</a> (<a href="/wiki/Simon_Chandler" title="Simon Chandler">Simon Chandler</a>), and <a href="/wiki/Samwise_Gamgee" title="Samwise Gamgee">Sam</a> (Michael Scholes). After a narrow escape from the Ringwraiths, the hobbits eventually come to <a href="/wiki/Bree_(Middle-earth)" title="Bree (Middle-earth)">Bree</a>, from which <a href="/wiki/Aragorn" title="Aragorn">Aragorn</a> (<a href="/wiki/John_Hurt" title="John Hurt">John Hurt</a>) leads them to <a href="/wiki/Rivendell" title="Rivendell">Rivendell</a>. Frodo is stabbed atop <a href="/wiki/Weathertop" title="Weathertop">Weathertop</a> mountain by the <a href="/wiki/Witch-king_of_Angmar" title="Witch-king of Angmar">chief of the Ringwraiths</a>, and becomes sickened as the journey progresses. The Ringwraiths catch up with them shortly after they meet the elf <a href="/wiki/Legolas" title="Legolas">Legolas</a> (<a href="/wiki/Anthony_Daniels" title="Anthony Daniels">Anthony Daniels</a>); and at a standoff at the ford of Rivendell, the Ringwraiths are swept away by the river.
</p><p>At Rivendell, Frodo is healed by <a href="/wiki/Elrond" title="Elrond">Elrond</a> (<a href="/wiki/Andr%C3%A9_Morell" title="André Morell">André Morell</a>). He meets Gandalf again, after the latter escapes <a href="/wiki/Saruman" title="Saruman">Saruman</a> (Fraser Kerr), who plans to ally with Sauron but also wants the Ring for himself. At a council, Bilbo, Gandalf, and others debate the One Ring, and Frodo volunteers to go to <a href="/wiki/Mordor" title="Mordor">Mordor</a>, where the Ring can be destroyed. Thereafter Frodo sets off from Rivendell with eight companions: Gandalf; Aragorn; <a href="/wiki/Boromir" title="Boromir">Boromir</a> (<a href="/wiki/Michael_Graham_Cox" title="Michael Graham Cox">Michael Graham Cox</a>), son of the <a href="/wiki/Stewards_of_Gondor" title="Stewards of Gondor">Steward</a> of <a href="/wiki/Gondor" title="Gondor">Gondor</a>; Legolas; <a href="/wiki/Gimli_(Middle-earth)" title="Gimli (Middle-earth)">Gimli</a> (<a href="/wiki/David_Buck" title="David Buck">David Buck</a>) the dwarf; and Frodo's three hobbit companions.
</p><p>Their attempt to cross the <a href="/wiki/Misty_Mountains" title="Misty Mountains">Misty Mountains</a> is foiled by heavy snow, and they are forced into <a href="/wiki/Moria_(Middle-earth)" title="Moria (Middle-earth)">Moria</a>.

The remaining Fellowship continue through the elf-haven <a href="/wiki/Lothl%C3%B3rien" title="Lothlórien">Lothlórien</a>, where they meet the elf queen <a href="/wiki/Galadriel" title="Galadriel">Galadriel</a> (<a href="/wiki/Annette_Crosbie" title="Annette Crosbie">Annette Crosbie</a>). Boromir tries to take the Ring from Frodo, and Frodo decides to continue his quest alone; but Sam insists on accompanying him. Boromir is killed by orcs while trying to defend Merry and Pippin. They are captured by the orcs, who intend to take them to <a href="/wiki/Isengard" title="Isengard">Isengard</a> through the land of <a href="/wiki/Rohan_(Middle-earth)" title="Rohan (Middle-earth)">Rohan</a>. The hobbits escape and flee into <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fangorn_Forest" title="Fangorn Forest">Fangorn Forest</a>, where they meet <a href="/wiki/Treebeard" title="Treebeard">Treebeard</a> (<a href="/wiki/John_Westbrook_(actor)" title="John Westbrook (actor)">John Westbrook</a>). Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas track Merry and Pippin into the forest, where they are re-united with Gandalf, who was reborn after destroying the balrog.
</p><p>The four then ride to Rohan's capital, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Edoras" title="Edoras">Edoras</a>, where Gandalf persuades King <a href="/wiki/Th%C3%A9oden" title="Théoden">Théoden</a> (<a href="/wiki/Philip_Stone" title="Philip Stone">Philip Stone</a>) that his people are in danger. Aragorn, Gimli, and Legolas then travel to the <a href="/wiki/Helm%27s_Deep" title="Helm's Deep">Helm's Deep</a>. Frodo and Sam discover Gollum stalking them in an attempt to reclaim the ring, and capture him; but spare his life in return for guidance to Mount Doom. Gollum eventually begins plotting against them, and wonders if "<a href="/wiki/Shelob" title="Shelob">she</a>" might help. At Helm's Deep, Théoden's forces resist the orcs sent by Saruman, until Gandalf arrives with the absent Riders of Rohan, destroying the orc army.
</p><p>In the year 2023 in a dystopian future, <a href="/wiki/Sentinel_(comics)" title="Sentinel (comics)">Sentinels</a> have been programmed to identify and hunt down <a href="/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Mutant (Marvel Comics)">mutants</a> and any humans who dared to help them.

</p><p>Erik obtains his signature helmet back from the Pentagon to block out Xavier's psychic powers and secretly takes control of Trask's Sentinel prototypes. Returning to the X-Mansion, Xavier ultimately abandons the serum, regaining his mutant power, and communicates with his future self, who inspires him to protect the relationship between mutants and baseline humans. After using <a href="/wiki/Cerebro" title="Cerebro">Cerebro</a> to track Mystique, he, McCoy and Wolverine take flight to <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> to put an end to her plot to assassinate Trask.

</p><p>In the future, the Sentinels manage to find the X-Men and launch an attack on them. Many perish while attempting to buy more time. In 1973, Xavier persuades Mystique to spare Trask after she saves Nixon from Magneto, altering history and erasing the Sentinels from existence. Magneto and Mystique both leave, one a criminal, the other a hero; and Trask is jailed for attempting to sell U.S. military secrets to Vietnamese officials.

</p><p>Twenty years in the past, <a href="/wiki/Professor_X" title="Professor X">Professor Charles Xavier</a> and <a href="/wiki/Magneto_(comics)" title="Magneto (comics)">Erik Lehnsherr</a> meet young <a href="/wiki/Jean_Grey" title="Jean Grey">Jean Grey</a> at her parents' house to invite her to join their school, the <a href="/wiki/X-Mansion" title="X-Mansion">X-Mansion</a>.

</p><p>In the present, Worthington Labs announces it has developed an inoculation to suppress the X-gene that gives <a href="/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Mutant (Marvel Comics)">mutants</a> their abilities, and offer the "cure" to any mutant who wants it. The cure is created from the <a href="/wiki/Genome" title="Genome">genome</a> of a young mutant named <a href="/wiki/Leech_(comics)" title="Leech (comics)">Jimmy</a>, who lives at the Worthington facility on <a href="/wiki/Alcatraz_Island" title="Alcatraz Island">Alcatraz Island</a>. While some mutants are interested in the cure, including the <a href="/wiki/X-Men" title="X-Men">X-Men</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Rogue_(comics)" title="Rogue (comics)">Rogue</a>, many others are horrified by the announcement. Magneto re-establishes his <a href="/wiki/Brotherhood_of_Mutants" title="Brotherhood of Mutants">Brotherhood of Mutants</a> with those who oppose the cure, warning his followers that the cure will be forcefully used to exterminate the mutant race.
</p><p>With help from <a href="/wiki/Pyro_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Pyro (Marvel Comics)">Pyro</a>, Magneto recruits <a href="/wiki/Callisto_(comics)" title="Callisto (comics)">Callisto</a> and several other mutants. They attack the mobile prison holding Mystique to free her, also freeing <a href="/wiki/Juggernaut_(comics)" title="Juggernaut (comics)">Juggernaut</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jamie_Madrox" title="Jamie Madrox">Multiple Man</a>. Mystique, shielding Magneto from a cure dart, is hit by it and loses her mutant abilities. Magneto abandons her as a result.
</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Cyclops_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Cyclops (Marvel Comics)">Scott Summers</a>, still distraught over the loss of his fiancée Jean Grey, drives to her resting location at Alkali Lake. Jean appears to Summers but, as the two kiss, Jean kills him. Sensing trouble, Xavier sends <a href="/wiki/Wolverine_(character)" title="Wolverine (character)">Logan</a> and <a href="/wiki/Storm_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Storm (Marvel Comics)">Storm</a> to investigate. When they arrive, they find only <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Telekinesis" title="Telekinesis">telekinetically</a> floating rocks, Summers' glasses, and an unconscious Jean.
</p><p>When Logan and Storm return to the X-Mansion, Xavier explains to Logan that when Jean sacrificed herself to save them, she also freed the "<a href="/wiki/Phoenix_Force_(comics)" title="Phoenix Force (comics)">Phoenix</a>", a dark and extremely powerful <a href="/wiki/Dissociative_identity_disorder" title="Dissociative identity disorder">alternate personality</a> which Xavier had telepathically repressed, aware of the Phoenix's godlike destructive potential. Logan is disgusted to learn of this psychic tampering with Jean's mind but, once she awakens, he discovers that she killed Summers and is not the Jean Grey he once knew. The Phoenix emerges, knocks out Logan, and escapes to her childhood home.
</p><p>Magneto learns of Jean's resurrection through Callisto, and the X-Men arrive at the Grey home at the same time as the Brotherhood. Magneto and Xavier go in, and both vie for Jean's loyalty until the Phoenix resurfaces. She destroys the house and disintegrates Xavier before Magneto and Logan can stop her. Jean leaves with Magneto. After interrogating Mystique, the FBI discover Magneto's base in the woods. However, the life forms in the camp are all decoy copies of Multiple Man. Magneto and the Brotherhood have gone to storm Alcatraz by telekinetically rerouting the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge" title="Golden Gate Bridge">Golden Gate Bridge</a>. The remaining X-Men confront the Brotherhood, despite being significantly outnumbered, and arrive just as the military troops who thus far have been neutralizing the attacking mutants are overwhelmed by the Brotherhood.
</p><p>During the fight, <a href="/wiki/Kitty_Pryde" title="Kitty Pryde">Kitty Pryde</a> saves Jimmy from Juggernaut, who had been sent to kill him. Logan has Colossus throw him at Magneto and distract him long enough for <a href="/wiki/Beast_(comics)" title="Beast (comics)">Hank McCoy</a> to inject Magneto with the "cure" and thus nullify his powers. Army reinforcements arrive and shoot at Jean just as Logan had calmed her down. The Phoenix is awakened by the attack and disintegrates the troops in retaliation. The Phoenix then begins to destroy Alcatraz and anyone within range of her powers. Logan realizes that only he can stop the Phoenix due to his healing factor and <a href="/wiki/Adamantium" title="Adamantium">adamantium</a> skeleton. When Logan approaches her, Jean momentarily gains control and begs him to save her. Logan fatally stabs Jean, killing the Phoenix, but mourns her death.
</p><p>Some time later, mutant rights are finally obtained and Xavier's school is still operating with Storm as headmistress. The President of the United States appoints <a href="/wiki/Beast_(comics)" title="Beast (comics)">Hank McCoy</a> as ambassador to the <a href="/wiki/United_Nations" title="United Nations">United Nations</a>. Rogue reveals to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Iceman_(comics)" title="Iceman (comics)">Bobby Drake</a> that she has taken the cure, much to his disappointment. Meanwhile, Magneto sits at a chessboard in San Francisco, human and weak. As he gestures toward a metal chess piece, it moves slightly, suggesting that the cure is not permanent after all.

Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Wolverine_(character)" title="Wolverine (character)">Wolverine</a> explores an abandoned military installation at Alkali Lake in <a href="/wiki/Alberta" title="Alberta">Alberta</a> for clues to his past, but finds nothing. Jean has been having premonitions and struggles to concentrate as her powers become increasingly difficult to control. Later Wolverine returns to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Professor_Xavier" title="Professor Xavier">Professor Xavier</a>'s school for mutants, and Xavier tracks Nightcrawler using <a href="/wiki/Cerebro" title="Cerebro">Cerebro</a>. Xavier and <a href="/wiki/Cyclops_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Cyclops (Marvel Comics)">Cyclops</a> go to question the imprisoned <a href="/wiki/Magneto_(comics)" title="Magneto (comics)">Magneto</a> about the attack, while X-Men <a href="/wiki/Storm_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Storm (Marvel Comics)">Storm</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jean_Grey" title="Jean Grey">Jean Grey</a> retrieve Nightcrawler. Military scientist Colonel <a href="/wiki/William_Stryker" title="William Stryker">William Stryker</a> approaches the president and receives approval to investigate Xavier's mansion for their ties to mutants. Stryker's forces invade the school and abduct some of the students. <a href="/wiki/Colossus_(comics)" title="Colossus (comics)">Colossus</a> leads the remaining students to safety while Wolverine, <a href="/wiki/Rogue_(comics)" title="Rogue (comics)">Rogue</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Iceman_(comics)" title="Iceman (comics)">Iceman</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Pyro_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Pyro (Marvel Comics)">Pyro</a> escape, and Stryker's assistant <a href="/wiki/Lady_Deathstrike" title="Lady Deathstrike">Yuriko Oyama</a> captures Cyclops and Xavier. During the attack Wolverine confronts Stryker, who knows him by name.
</p><p>The shape-shifting <a href="/wiki/Mystique_(comics)" title="Mystique (comics)">Mystique</a> gains information about Magneto's prison and helps him escape while also discovering schematics for a second Cerebro. Wolverine, Rogue, Iceman, and Pyro visit Iceman's parents in <a href="/wiki/Boston" title="Boston">Boston</a> and meet up with Storm, Jean, and Nightcrawler. The <a href="/wiki/Blackbird_(comics)" title="Blackbird (comics)">X-Jet</a> is attacked by fighter jets while flying back to the mansion and is shot down, but Magneto saves them from crashing. Magneto explains to the group that Stryker has built the second Cerebro to use it, and Xavier, to telepathically kill every mutant on the planet. Stryker's son, Jason, is a mutant with mind-controlling powers, which Stryker will use to force Xavier to do this. Stryker had also previously used Jason's powers to orchestrate Nightcrawler's attack as a pretense to gain approval to invade Xavier's mansion. Magneto also tells Wolverine that Stryker was the man who grafted his <a href="/wiki/Adamantium" title="Adamantium">adamantium</a> skeleton onto his bones. Jean reads Nightcrawler's mind and determines that Stryker's base is underground in a dam at Alkali Lake.
</p><p>Disguised as Logan, Mystique infiltrates Stryker's base. She lets the rest of the mutants in and Magneto and Mystique go to disable Cerebro before the brainwashed Xavier can activate it. Storm and Nightcrawler rescue the captured students, and Jean fights a mind-controlled Cyclops; their battle frees Cyclops but damages the dam, which begins to rupture. Wolverine finds Stryker in an adamantium smelting lab and remembers it as where he received his adamantium skeleton. Wolverine fights and kills Yuriko, then chases Stryker to a helicopter pad and chains him to the helicopter's wheel. Magneto stops Cerebro and, using Mystique impersonating Stryker to command Jason, has Xavier redirect its powers on normal humans. The two subsequently use Stryker's helicopter to escape, accompanied by Pyro who has been swayed to Magneto's views. Nightcrawler teleports Storm inside Cerebro, where she creates a snowstorm to break Jason's concentration and free Xavier from his control.
</p><p>The X-Men flee the dam as water engulfs it, killing Stryker, but the X-Jet loses all power and struggles to take flight as the flood water rushes towards them. Jean sneaks off the jet and telepathically wishes the team goodbye. She holds back the water and raises the jet above it as flames erupt from her body, until she lets go and allows the flood to crash down upon her; presumably killing her. The X-Men give the president Stryker's files, and Xavier warns him that humans and mutants must work together to build peace. Back at the school, Xavier, Cyclops, and Wolverine remember Jean, and Xavier begins to hold a class.

In his office, Schmidt orders Lehnsherr to move a coin on his desk, and kills the boy's mother when Lehnsherr fails to do so. In grief and rage, Lehnsherr's magnetic power manifests, killing two guards and destroying the room. Meanwhile, in a mansion in <a href="/wiki/Westchester_County,_New_York" title="Westchester County, New York">Westchester County, New York</a>, child <a href="/wiki/Telepathy" title="Telepathy">telepath</a> <a href="/wiki/Professor_X" title="Professor X">Charles Xavier</a> meets young shapeshifter <a href="/wiki/Mystique_(comics)" title="Mystique (comics)">Raven</a>, whose natural form is blue-skinned and scaly.

Shaw, an energy-absorbing mutant whose powers have de-aged him, later kills Hendry.
</p><p>MacTaggert, seeking Xavier's advice on mutation, takes him and Raven to the CIA, where they convince Director McCone that mutants exist and Shaw is a threat. Another CIA officer sponsors the mutants and invites them to the secret "Division X" facility. MacTaggert and Xavier find Shaw as Lehnsherr is attacking him on his yacht, and rescue Lehnsherr from drowning, while Shaw escapes in a submarine. Xavier brings Lehnsherr to Division X, where they meet young scientist <a href="/wiki/Beast_(comics)" title="Beast (comics)">Hank McCoy</a>, a mutant with <a href="/wiki/Prehensile_feet" title="Prehensile feet">prehensile feet</a>, who believes Raven's DNA may provide a "cure" for their appearance. Xavier uses McCoy's mutant-locating device <a href="/wiki/Cerebro" title="Cerebro">Cerebro</a> to seek recruits against Shaw.

</p><p>When Frost meets with a Soviet general in the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">USSR</a>, and uses her telepathic powers to pretend to have sex with him, Xavier and Lehnsherr capture Frost and discover that Shaw intends to start <a href="/wiki/World_War_III" title="World War III">World War III</a> that will trigger mutant ascendancy and the extinction of the human race. Azazel, Riptide and Shaw attack Division X, killing everyone but the mutants, whom Shaw invites to join him. Salvadore accepts; and when Summers and Muñoz retaliate, Shaw kills Muñoz. In Moscow, Shaw compels the general to have the USSR <a href="/wiki/Cuban_Missile_Crisis" title="Cuban Missile Crisis">install missiles</a> in <a href="/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>. Wearing a helmet that blocks telepathy, Shaw follows the Soviet fleet in a submarine to ensure the missiles break a US blockade.
</p><p>Raven, thinking McCoy is attracted to her in her natural form, tells him not to use the cure. When she later attempts to seduce Lehnsherr by taking the forms of various women, Lehnsherr tells her she is beautiful as she is, in her natural mutant form. McCoy uses the cure on himself but it backfires, giving him blue fur and leonine aspects. With McCoy piloting, the mutants and MacTaggert take a jet to the blockade line, where Xavier uses his telepathy to influence a Soviet sailor to destroy the ship carrying the missiles, and Lehnsherr uses his magnetic power to lift Shaw's submarine from the water and deposit it on land. During the ensuing battle, Lehnsherr seizes Shaw's helmet, allowing Xavier to immobilize Shaw. Lehnsherr tells Shaw he shares Shaw's <a href="/wiki/Chosen_people" title="Chosen people">exclusivist</a> view of mutants but, to avenge his mother, kills Shaw—over Xavier's objections—by forcing the Nazi coin from his childhood through Shaw's brain, causing massive pain to Xavier in the process.
</p><p>Fearing the mutants, both fleets fire missiles at them, which Lehnsherr turns back in mid-flight. MacTaggert tries to stop Lehnsherr by shooting him but he deflects the bullets, one of which hits Xavier in the spine. Lehnsherr rushes to help Xavier and, distracted, allows the missiles to fall harmlessly into the ocean. Parting with Xavier over their differing views on the relationship between mutants and humans, Lehnsherr leaves with Salvadore, Azazel, Riptide and Mystique. Later, Xavier – now using a wheelchair – and his mutants are at the <a href="/wiki/Mansion" title="Mansion">X Mansion</a>, where he intends to open a school. MacTaggert promises never to reveal his location and they kiss. When they kiss, Xavier uses his powers and erases their memories from her mind. Elsewhere, Lehnsherr, now wearing Shaw's helmet, frees Frost from confinement and introduces himself as "Magneto".

</p><p>Senator Kelly is abducted by two more of Magneto's minions, <a href="/wiki/Toad_(comics)" title="Toad (comics)">Toad</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mystique_(comics)" title="Mystique (comics)">Mystique</a> and is brought to their hideout on the uncharted island of <a href="/wiki/Genosha" title="Genosha">Genosha</a>. There, Magneto uses Kelly as a <a href="/wiki/Human_subject_research" title="Human subject research">test subject</a> for a machine powered by his magnetic abilities that generates a field of <a href="/wiki/Radiation" title="Radiation">radiation</a>, inducing mutation in normal humans. Kelly later escapes by taking advantage of his newfound mutation. Rogue visits Wolverine during the night while he is having a nightmare; however, he accidentally stabs her once startled, but Rogue is able to absorb his healing ability to recover, which other students witness, having arrived to help. She is later convinced by Mystique, who disguises herself as Rogue's crush <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Iceman_(comics)" title="Iceman (comics)">Bobby Drake</a>, that Xavier is angry with her and she should leave the school. Xavier uses his mutant-locating machine <a href="/wiki/Cerebro" title="Cerebro">Cerebro</a> to find Rogue at a train station, and the X-Men go to retrieve her. Meanwhile, Mystique enters Cerebro and sabotages it.
</p><p>Having left ahead of Storm and Cyclops, Wolverine finds Rogue on a train and convinces her to return to the school. Before they can leave, Magneto arrives, knocks out Wolverine and subdues Rogue. Although Xavier attempts to stop Magneto by mentally controlling Sabretooth, he is forced to release his hold on Sabretooth when Magneto threatens the police who have converged on the train station, allowing Magneto's Brotherhood to escape with Rogue. Kelly arrives at Xavier's school, and Xavier reads his mind to learn about Magneto's machine. Realizing the strain of powering it nearly killed Magneto, the group deduces he intends to transfer his powers to Rogue and use her to power it at the cost of her life. Kelly's body rejects his mutation, and his body dissolves into liquid. Xavier attempts to locate Rogue using Cerebro, but Mystique's sabotage incapacitates him, and he falls into a <a href="/wiki/Coma" title="Coma">coma</a>. Fellow <a href="/wiki/Psychokinesis" title="Psychokinesis">telekinetic</a> and telepath <a href="/wiki/Jean_Grey" title="Jean Grey">Jean Grey</a> fixes Cerebro and uses it, learning that Magneto plans to place his mutation-inducing machine on <a href="/wiki/Liberty_Island" title="Liberty Island">Liberty Island</a> and use it to "mutate" the world leaders meeting at a summit on nearby <a href="/wiki/Ellis_Island" title="Ellis Island">Ellis Island</a>. The X-Men scale the <a href="/wiki/Statue_of_Liberty" title="Statue of Liberty">Statue of Liberty</a>, battling the Brotherhood while Magneto transfers his powers to Rogue and activates the mutating machine. As Wolverine confronts and distracts Magneto, Cyclops blasts him away, allowing Wolverine to destroy the machine. He transfers his powers to Rogue and his healing abilities rejuvenate her, while incapacitating himself.
</p><p>Professor Xavier and Wolverine recover from their comas. The group also learn that Mystique escaped the island battle and is impersonating Senator Kelly. Xavier gives Wolverine a lead to his past at an abandoned military installation in Canada. Magneto is imprisoned in a complex constructed of plastic and is visited by Xavier, and Magneto warns him he intends to escape one day and continue the fight.
</p><p>After fighting organized crime as the mercenary <a href="/wiki/Deadpool" title="Deadpool">Deadpool</a> for two years, Wade Wilson fails to kill one of his targets on his anniversary with <a href="/wiki/Copycat_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Copycat (Marvel Comics)">Vanessa</a>, his girlfriend. That night, after the pair decide to start a family together, the target tracks Wilson down and inadvertently kills Vanessa. Wilson kills the man in revenge. He blames himself for her death and attempts to commit suicide six weeks later by blowing himself up. Wilson has a vision of Vanessa in the afterlife, but the pieces of his body remain alive and are put back together by <a href="/wiki/Colossus_(comics)" title="Colossus (comics)">Colossus</a>. Wilson is left with only a <a href="/wiki/Skee-Ball" title="Skee-Ball">Skee-Ball</a> token, an anniversary gift, as a final memento of Vanessa.
</p><p>Recovering at the <a href="/wiki/X-Mansion" title="X-Mansion">X-Mansion</a>, Wilson reluctantly agrees to join the <a href="/wiki/X-Men" title="X-Men">X-Men</a> because he believes Vanessa would have wanted him to. He, Colossus, and <a href="/wiki/Negasonic_Teenage_Warhead" title="Negasonic Teenage Warhead">Negasonic Teenage Warhead</a> respond to a standoff between authorities and the unstable young mutant <a href="/wiki/Rusty_Collins" title="Rusty Collins">Russell Collins / Firefist</a> at an orphanage, labeled a "Mutant Reeducation Center". Wilson realizes that Collins has been abused by the orphanage staff, and kills one of the staff members. Colossus stops him from killing anyone else, and both Wilson and Collins are arrested. Restrained with collars that suppress their powers, they are taken to the Ice Box, an isolated prison for mutant criminals. Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Cable_(comics)" title="Cable (comics)">Cable</a>—a cybernetic soldier from the future whose family is murdered by an older Collins—travels back in time to kill Collins before he ever becomes a killer.
</p><p>Cable breaks into the Ice Box and attacks Collins. Wilson, whose collar breaks in the ensuing melee, attempts to defend Collins. After Cable takes Vanessa's token, Wilson forces himself and Cable out of the prison, but not before Collins overhears Wilson deny that he cares for the young mutant. Near death again, Wilson has another vision of Vanessa in which she convinces him to help Collins. Wilson organizes a team called <a href="/wiki/X-Force" title="X-Force">X-Force</a> to break Collins out of a prison-transfer convoy and defend him from Cable. The team launches its assault on the convoy by parachute, but all of the members die during the landing except for Wilson and the lucky <a href="/wiki/Domino_(comics)" title="Domino (comics)">Domino</a>. While they fight Cable, Collins frees fellow inmate <a href="/wiki/Juggernaut_(comics)" title="Juggernaut (comics)">Juggernaut</a>, who agrees to help Collins kill the abusive orphanage headmaster. Juggernaut destroys the convoy, allowing himself and Collins to escape.
</p><p>Cable offers to work with Wilson and Domino to stop Collins' first murder, and agrees to give Wilson a chance to talk Collins down. At the orphanage, they are overpowered by Juggernaut while Collins attacks the headmaster, until Colossus—who had at first refused to help Wilson due to Wilson's murderous ways—arrives to distract Juggernaut. When Wilson fails to talk down Collins, Cable shoots at the young mutant. Wilson leaps in front of the bullet while wearing the Ice Box collar and dies, reuniting with Vanessa in the afterlife. Seeing this sacrifice, Collins does not kill the headmaster; this changes the future so that Cable's family now survives. Cable uses the last charge on his time-traveling device, which he needed for returning to his family, to go back several minutes and strap Vanessa's token in front of Wilson's heart. Now when Wilson takes the bullet for Collins, it is stopped by the token and both survive while Collins still has his change of heart. Afterwards, the headmaster is run over by Wilson's taxi-driver friend Dopinder.

They become romantically involved, and a year later she accepts his marriage proposal. Wilson is diagnosed with terminal cancer, and leaves Vanessa without warning so she will not have to watch him die.
</p><p>A mysterious recruiter approaches Wilson, offering an experimental cure for his cancer. He is taken to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ajax_(Francis_Fanny)" title="Ajax (Francis Fanny)">Ajax</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Angel_Dust_(comics)" title="Angel Dust (comics)">Angel Dust</a>, who inject him with a serum designed to awaken latent <a href="/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Mutant (Marvel Comics)">mutant genes</a>. They subject Wilson to days of torture to induce stress and trigger any mutation he may have, without success. When Wilson discovers Ajax's real name is Francis and mocks him for it, Ajax leaves Wilson in a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Hyperbaric_chamber" title="Hyperbaric chamber">hyperbaric chamber</a> that periodically takes him to the verge of asphyxiation over a weekend. This finally activates a superhuman healing ability that cures the cancer but leaves Wilson severely disfigured with burn-like scars over his entire body. He escapes from the chamber and attacks Ajax but relents when told that his disfigurement can be cured. Ajax subdues Wilson and leaves him for dead in the now-burning laboratory.
</p><p>Wilson survives and seeks out Vanessa. He does not reveal to her he is alive fearing her reaction to his new appearance. After consulting with his best friend <a href="/wiki/Weasel_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Weasel (Marvel Comics)">Weasel</a>, Wilson decides to hunt down Ajax for the cure. He becomes a masked vigilante, adopting the name "Deadpool" (from Weasel picking him in a <a href="/wiki/Dead_pool" title="Dead pool">dead pool</a>), and moves into the home of an elderly blind woman named <a href="/wiki/Blind_Al" title="Blind Al">Al</a>. He questions and murders many of Ajax's men until one, the recruiter, reveals his whereabouts. Deadpool intercepts Ajax and a convoy of armed men on an expressway. He kills everyone but Ajax, and demands the cure from him but the X-Man <a href="/wiki/Colossus_(comics)" title="Colossus (comics)">Colossus</a> and his trainee <a href="/wiki/Negasonic_Teenage_Warhead" title="Negasonic Teenage Warhead">Negasonic Teenage Warhead</a> interrupt him. Colossus wants Deadpool to mend his ways and join the <a href="/wiki/X-Men" title="X-Men">X-Men</a>. Taking advantage of this distraction, Ajax escapes. He goes to Weasel's bar where he learns of Vanessa.
</p><p>Ajax kidnaps Vanessa and takes her to a decommissioned <a href="/wiki/Helicarrier" title="Helicarrier">helicarrier</a> in a scrapyard. Deadpool convinces Colossus and Negasonic to help him. They battle Angel Dust and several soldiers while Deadpool fights his way to Ajax. During the battle, Negasonic accidentally destroys the equipment stabilizing the helicarrier. Deadpool protects Vanessa from the collapsing ship, while Colossus carries Negasonic and Angel Dust to safety. Ajax attacks Deadpool again but is overpowered. He reveals there is no cure after all and, despite Colossus's pleading, Deadpool kills him. He promises to try to be more heroic moving forward. Though Vanessa is angry with Wilson for leaving her, she reconciles with him.
</p><p>In a dystopian 2029, no <a href="/wiki/Mutant_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Mutant (Marvel Comics)">mutants</a> have been born in 25 years. <a href="/wiki/Wolverine_(character)" title="Wolverine (character)">Logan</a>'s healing ability has weakened and he has physically aged. The adamantium coating on his skeleton has begun to leak into his body, poisoning him. Hiding in plain sight, Logan spends his days working as a limo driver in <a href="/wiki/El_Paso,_Texas" title="El Paso, Texas">El Paso, Texas</a>. In an abandoned <a href="/wiki/Smelting" title="Smelting">smelting plant</a> in northern Mexico, he and mutant tracker <a href="/wiki/Caliban_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Caliban (Marvel Comics)">Caliban</a> care for 97-year-old <a href="/wiki/Professor_X" title="Professor X">Charles Xavier</a>, Logan's mentor and founder of the <a href="/wiki/X-Men" title="X-Men">X-Men</a>. Charles, a telepath, has developed a form of <a href="/wiki/Dementia" title="Dementia">dementia</a> that causes him to have seizures unless controlled with medication. It is alluded that a seizure one year prior, releasing a destructive wave of his telepathic powers, had killed seven mutants, thus leaving the three as the last of the X-Men. 
</p><p>Gabriela Lopez, a former nurse for biotechnology corporation Alkali-Transigen, tries to hire Logan to escort her and an 11-year-old girl, <a href="/wiki/X-23" title="X-23">Laura</a>, to Eden, a refuge in <a href="/wiki/North_Dakota" title="North Dakota">North Dakota</a>. Logan reluctantly accepts but later finds Gabriela killed. He is confronted at his Mexican hideout by Gabriela's killer <a href="/wiki/Donald_Pierce" title="Donald Pierce">Donald Pierce</a>, Transigen's <a href="/wiki/Cyborg" title="Cyborg">cyborg</a> chief of security, who is looking for Laura. Laura has stowed away in Logan's limo and has powers similar to Logan's. She, Logan, and Charles escape Pierce and his <a href="/wiki/Reavers_(comics)" title="Reavers (comics)">Reavers</a>, but Caliban is captured and tortured by Pierce into tracking Laura.
</p><p>A video on Gabriela's cellphone shows that Transigen created Laura and other children from mutant DNA samples to turn into weapons. Laura was created from Logan's DNA. As they proved difficult to control and Transigen had found an alternative, the children were to be killed, but Gabriela and other nurses helped some of them escape. In Oklahoma City, Logan discovers that Eden appears in an X-Men comic in Laura's possession and tells her it is fictional. The Reavers arrive, but Charles has a seizure and incapacitates everyone in the vicinity except for Logan and Laura, who kill the attackers and inject Charles with his medication. As they flee, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Marvel_Comics_characters:_R#Zander_Rice" title="List of Marvel Comics characters: R">Dr. Zander Rice</a>, head of Transigen, arrives to help Pierce.
</p><p>Logan, Laura, and Charles help farmer Will Munson and his family after a traffic incident, accepting an offer of dinner at their home. Logan drives off enforcers from a corporate farm harassing Will. Rice unleashes X-24, a clone of Logan in his prime and his alternative to the child program, who murders Will's family and Charles, stabs Will and captures Laura. Caliban sets off grenades, killing himself and several Reavers while injuring Pierce. Logan fights X-24 but is outmatched. Will pins X-24 with his truck, but dies from his injuries. Logan and Laura escape with Charles's body.
</p><p>After burying Charles, Logan passes out. Laura takes him to a doctor and persuades him to prove that the site in North Dakota isn't Eden. They arrive and find <a href="/wiki/Rictor" title="Rictor">Rictor</a> and other Transigen children preparing to cross to Canada. Laura finds an <a href="/wiki/Adamantium" title="Adamantium">adamantium</a> bullet Logan has kept since his escape from the <a href="/wiki/Weapon_X" title="Weapon X">Weapon X</a> facility, which he once considered using to commit suicide. Logan decides his job is done and chooses not to accompany them, much to Laura's dismay.
</p><p>When the children are captured by the Reavers, Logan takes an overdose of a serum given to him by Rictor that temporarily enhances his healing abilities and boosts his strength. With Laura's help, he slaughters most of the Reavers, but the serum wears off. As Pierce holds Rictor at gunpoint, Rice tells Logan (who killed Rice's father years ago at Weapon X), that no new mutants were born due to a virus created by Transigen that has been distributed through the world's food supply and which was also causing the decay of Logan's healing factor. Rice is shot dead by Logan, who then attacks Pierce. X-24, enraged by Rice's death, fights Logan. With their guards distracted, the children kill Pierce and the remaining Reavers. Rictor uses his powers to flip a truck onto X-24, but he frees himself and impales Logan on a large tree branch. As X-24 continues clawing Logan, Laura shoots X-24 in the head with the adamantium bullet, killing him.
</p><p>Near death, Logan tells Laura not to become the weapon she was made to be, and after Laura finally tearfully acknowledges him as her father, Logan dies peacefully in her arms. Laura and the children mourn Logan's death and bury him. Laura turns his grave marker on its side to create an X, to honor him as the last of the X-Men, and she then departs with the other children to continue their trek to the Canadian border.
</p><p>In 1945, <a href="/wiki/Wolverine_(character)" title="Wolverine (character)">Logan</a> is held in a Japanese <a href="/wiki/Prisoner-of-war_camp" title="Prisoner-of-war camp">POW camp</a> near Nagasaki. During the <a href="/wiki/Atomic_bombings_of_Hiroshima_and_Nagasaki" title="Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki">atomic bombing of Nagasaki</a>, Logan saves an officer named Ichirō Yashida by shielding him from the blast.
</p><p>In the present day, Logan lives as a hermit in <a href="/wiki/Yukon" title="Yukon">Yukon</a>, tormented by hallucinations of <a href="/wiki/Jean_Grey" title="Jean Grey">Jean Grey</a>, whom he was forced to kill to save the world.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[N 2]</a></sup> He is located by <a href="/wiki/Yukio_(comics)" title="Yukio (comics)">Yukio</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Mutant_(comics)" title="Mutant (comics)">mutant</a> with the ability to foresee people's deaths, on behalf of Ichirō, now the CEO of a technology <a href="/wiki/Zaibatsu" title="Zaibatsu">zaibatsu</a>. Ichirō, who is dying of cancer, wants Logan to accompany Yukio to Japan so that he may repay his life debt. In Tokyo, Logan meets Ichirō's son, <a href="/wiki/Shingen_Yashida" title="Shingen Yashida">Shingen</a>, and granddaughter, <a href="/wiki/Mariko_Yashida" title="Mariko Yashida">Mariko</a>. There, Ichirō offers to transfer Logan's healing abilities into his own body, thus saving Ichirō's life and alleviating Logan of his near-immortality, which Logan views as a curse. Logan refuses and prepares to leave the following day. That night, Ichirō's physician Dr. Green (also known as <a href="/wiki/Viper_(Madame_Hydra)" title="Viper (Madame Hydra)">Viper</a>) introduces something into Logan's body, but Logan dismisses it as a dream.
</p><p>The next morning, Yukio informs Logan that Ichirō has died and that she did not foresee his death. At the funeral, <a href="/wiki/Yakuza" title="Yakuza">Yakuza</a> gangsters attempt to kidnap Mariko, but Logan and Mariko escape together into the urban sprawl of Tokyo. Harada, a Ninja of the Blackfoot clan, shots off some of the Yakuza with arrows from atop of the city buildings to protect Mariko. Logan is shot and his wounds do not heal as quickly as they should. After fighting off more Yakuza on a <a href="/wiki/Shinkansen" title="Shinkansen">bullet train</a>, Logan and Mariko hide in a local <a href="/wiki/Love_hotel" title="Love hotel">love hotel</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Silver_Samurai#Kenuichio_Harada" title="Silver Samurai">Harada</a> meets with Dr. Green who, after demonstrating her mutant powers on him, demands he find Logan and Mariko. Logan and Mariko travel to Ichirō's house in Nagasaki, and the two slowly fall in love. Back in Tokyo, Shingen uses the local police to search for Mariko. He also enlist Mariko's fiance Noburo Mori, a corrupt Minister Of Justice, to use his underworld contacts. Shingen expresses to Noburo that he is anxious to find Mariko before Ichiro's will is read in 3 days. Meanwhile, Yukio has a vision of Logan dying and goes to warn him. Before Yukio arrives, Mariko is captured by the Yakuza. After interrogating one of the kidnappers, Logan and Yukio confront Noburo. Noburo confesses that he conspired with Shingen to have Mariko killed because Ichirō left control of the company to Mariko, and not Shingen. 
</p><p>Mariko is brought before Shingen at Ichirō's estate where he attempts to kill her. The Blackfoot Ninjas led by Harada and accompanied by Dr. Green arrive and attack the compound. Dr. Green stabs Shingen in the neck with a poisoned pen and the Ninjas whisk Mariko away. Logan and Yukio arrive later and, using Ichirō's X-ray machine, discover a robotic parasite attached to Logan's heart, suppressing his healing ability. Logan cuts himself open and extracts the device. During the operation, Shingen, who survived Dr. Green's attack, attempts to kill Logan but Yukio holds Shingen off long enough for Logan to recover and kill Shingen. Logan follows Mariko's trail to the village of Ichirō's birth, where he is captured by Harada's ninjas. Logan is placed in a machine by Dr. Green, who reveals her plans to extract his healing factor and introduces him to the <a href="/wiki/Silver_Samurai" title="Silver Samurai">Silver Samurai</a>, an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electromechanical" title="Electromechanical">electromechanical</a> suit of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Japanese_armor" title="Japanese armor">Japanese armor</a> with energized swords made of <a href="/wiki/Adamantium" title="Adamantium">adamantium</a>. Harada tries to convince Mariko that the events happening are for her well being but Mariko escapes from Harada by stabbing him in the leg. Harada sees the error of his ways and while attempting to stop the Silver Samurai he is killed.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Yukio arrives and kills Dr. Green as Logan fights the Silver Samurai. The Silver Samurai severs Logan's adamantium claws and begins to extract Logan's healing abilities through his bone marrow, revealing himself to be Ichirō, who had faked his death. Ichirō regains his youth, but Mariko intervenes and stabs Ichirō with Logan's severed claws. Logan regenerates his bone claws and kills Ichirō. Logan collapses and has one final hallucination of Jean, in which he decides to finally let her go. Mariko becomes CEO of Yashida Industries and bids farewell to Logan as he prepares to leave Japan. Yukio vows to stay by Logan's side as his bodyguard, and they depart to places unknown.
</p><p>In a mid-credits scene, Logan returns to the <a href="/wiki/United_States" title="United States">United States</a> two years later and is approached at the airport by <a href="/wiki/Magneto_(comics)" title="Magneto (comics)">Erik Lehnsherr</a>, who warns him of a grave new threat to the mutant race;<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-12"><a href="#cite_note-12">[N 3]</a></sup> and <a href="/wiki/Professor_X" title="Professor X">Charles Xavier</a>, whom Logan previously thought was dead.

In Vietnam, the increasingly violent Victor attempts to rape a Vietnamese woman and kills a senior officer who tries to stop him. James returns to Victor upon the commotion, and ignorant of his brother’s intent, he rushes to defend him.

</p><p>Six years later, Logan works as a logger in Canada, where he lives with his girlfriend <a href="/wiki/Silver_Fox_(comics)" title="Silver Fox (comics)">Kayla Silverfox</a>. Stryker and Zero approach Logan, reporting that Wade and Bradley have been killed; someone is targeting the team. Logan refuses to rejoin Stryker, but after finding Kayla's bloodied body in the woods, realizes that Victor is responsible. He finds Victor at a local bar, but Logan loses the subsequent fight. Afterward, Stryker explains that Victor has gone rogue and offers Logan a way to become strong enough to get his revenge. Logan undergoes a painful operation to reinforce his skeleton with <a href="/wiki/Adamantium" title="Adamantium">adamantium</a>, a virtually indestructible metal. Once the procedure is complete, Stryker orders that Logan's memory be erased so he can be used as Stryker's personal weapon, but Logan overhears and escapes to a nearby farm, where an elderly couple take him in. Zero kills the couple the following morning and tries to kill Logan, but Logan takes down Zero's helicopter and swears to kill both Stryker and Victor.
</p><p>Logan locates John and Fred at a boxing club. Fred explains that Victor still works for Stryker, hunting down mutants for Stryker to experiment on at his new laboratory, located at a place called "The Island". Fred mentions <a href="/wiki/Gambit_(comics)" title="Gambit (comics)">Remy "Gambit" LeBeau</a>, the only one who escaped from the island and therefore knows its location. John and Logan find LeBeau in <a href="/wiki/New_Orleans" title="New Orleans">New Orleans</a>, then both fight Victor, who kills John and extracts his DNA. Agreeing to help release mutants that Stryker has captured, Gambit takes Logan to Stryker's facility on <a href="/wiki/Three_Mile_Island_Nuclear_Generating_Station" title="Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station">Three Mile Island</a>. Logan learns that Kayla is alive, having been forced by Stryker into surveilling him in exchange for her sister's safety. However, Stryker refuses to release her sister and denies Victor the adamantium bonding promised for his service, claiming that test results revealed Victor would not survive the operation. Stryker activates Wade, now known as Weapon XI, a "mutant killer" with the powers of multiple mutants.
</p><p>While Logan and Victor fight off Weapon XI, Kayla is mortally wounded leading the captive mutants to <a href="/wiki/Professor_X" title="Professor X">Professor Charles Xavier</a> and safety. After Logan kills Weapon XI, Stryker arrives and shoots Logan in the head with adamantium bullets, rendering him unconscious. Before Stryker can shoot Kayla, she grabs him and uses her mutant power to persuade him to turn around and walk away until his feet bleed, then succumbs to her injuries. Logan regains consciousness but has <a href="/wiki/Retrograde_amnesia" title="Retrograde amnesia">lost his memory</a>. He notices his dog tags read "Logan" on one side and "Wolverine" on the other. He pauses upon noticing Kayla's body, but does not recognize her.

Their meeting is interrupted when another Russian <a href="/wiki/Akula-class_submarine" title="Akula-class submarine">Akula</a> submarine attacks the meeting place, apparently in retaliation for the previous submarine's sinking. Orm succeeds in destroying it and the attack convinces Nereus to join forces with Orm to defend the oceans. He swears allegiance to Orm's cause, but his daughter <a href="/wiki/Mera_(comics)" title="Mera (comics)">Mera</a>, who has been betrothed to Orm, refuses to aid them and journeys to the surface to ask Arthur for help, earning his trust by saving Thomas from a tsunami sent by Orm. Arthur reluctantly accompanies Mera to a rendezvous with Vulko, who urges Arthur to find the Trident of <a href="/wiki/List_of_minor_DC_Comics_characters#Atlan" title="List of minor DC Comics characters">Atlan</a>, a magic artifact that once belonged to Atlantis' first ruler, in order to reclaim his rightful place as king. They are ambushed by Orm's men and Mera and Vulko escape without having been seen, while Arthur is captured.
</p><p>Arthur is chained and presented before Orm, who blames Arthur and the surface for Atlanna's death. He offers Arthur an opportunity to leave forever, but Arthur instead challenges him to a duel in a ring of underwater lava. Orm gains the upper hand and nearly kills Arthur before Mera rescues him. Together, Arthur and Mera journey to the <a href="/wiki/Sahara" title="Sahara">Sahara</a> desert where the trident was forged and unlock a holographic message that leads them to <a href="/wiki/Sicily" title="Sicily">Sicily</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a>, where they retrieve the trident's coordinates. Meanwhile, Orm meets David, revealing that the submarine that had attacked them previously was in fact the same one David hijacked and that Orm had hired him to hijack the Russian nuclear submarine so that he could stage a false flag attack from the surface, making it seem like Orm's cause for war is justified and causing King Nereus to side with him. Orm provides David with a prototype Atlantean battle suit to kill Arthur, imprisons Vulko after revealing knowledge of his betrayal, and coerces the Atlantean Kingdom of the Fishermen to pledge their allegiance to him and his campaign against the surface.
</p><p>After modifying Orm's technology, a fully armored David rechristens himself as <a href="/wiki/Black_Manta" title="Black Manta">Black Manta</a> and ambushes Arthur and Mera in Sicily, grievously injuring Arthur before being thrown off a cliff to his apparent death. Mera nurses Arthur's wounds as they journey to the trident's whereabouts, and encourages him to embrace his destiny as a hero. Arriving at their destination, Arthur and Mera are attacked by the amphibious monsters called <a href="/wiki/The_Trench_(comics)" title="The Trench (comics)">the Trench</a>, but manage to fend them off and reach a wormhole that transports them to an uncharted sea located at the center of the Earth. There, they are unexpectedly reunited with Atlanna, who was sacrificed to the Trench for her crimes but managed to escape and reach the uncharted sea, where she has been stranded ever since.
</p><p>Arthur faces Karathen, a mythical <a href="/wiki/Leviathan" title="Leviathan">leviathan</a> and keeper of the trident, and voices his determination to protect both Atlantis and the surface, proving his worth and reclaiming the trident, which grants him control over the seven seas. Orm and his allies lead an army against the crustacean forces of the Kingdom of the Brine with the intent of completing Orm's surface battle preparations. As Orm declares himself Ocean Master, Arthur and Mera, with the assistance of Karathen and the Trench, intervene and lead an army of marine creatures in a battle against him. Orm's followers renounce their obedience to him and embrace Arthur as the true king upon learning he wields the trident. Arthur defeats Orm in combat but chooses to spare his life and Orm accepts his fate after discovering Arthur has found and rescued Atlanna. Atlanna returns to the surface to reunite with Thomas while Arthur ascends to the throne with Mera by his side.
</p><p>In a <a href="/wiki/Post-credits_scene" title="Post-credits scene">mid-credits scene</a>, David is rescued by Dr. <a href="/wiki/Stephen_Shin" title="Stephen Shin">Stephen Shin</a>, a scientist and conspiracy theorist obsessed with the Atlanteans, and agrees to lead Shin there in exchange for his help in his revenge on Arthur.

Billionaire Bruce Wayne, who has operated in <a href="/wiki/Gotham_City" title="Gotham City">Gotham City</a> as the vigilante <a href="/wiki/Batman" title="Batman">Batman</a> for twenty years, sees Superman as an extraterrestrial threat to humanity. After learning of Batman's form of justice, <a href="/wiki/Clark_Kent" title="Clark Kent">Clark Kent</a> (Superman's civilian identity) seeks to expose him via <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Planet" title="Daily Planet">Daily Planet</a></i> articles.

He instead makes alternative plans with Finch's subordinate and gains access to Zod's body and the Kryptonian scout ship.
</p><p>Bruce attends a gala at LexCorp to steal encrypted data from the company's mainframe, but has it taken from him by an antiquities dealer named <a href="/wiki/Wonder_Woman" title="Wonder Woman">Diana Prince</a>; she eventually returns it to Bruce when she is unable to access the information. While decrypting the drive, Bruce dreams of a post-apocalyptic world where he leads a group of rebels against an evil Superman. He is awakened from his dream by an unidentified person, appearing through a portal, who warns him of <a href="/wiki/Lois_Lane" title="Lois Lane">Lois Lane</a>'s crucial role in the future, and urges him to find "the others" before vanishing.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Timeline1_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Timeline1-9">[N 2]</a></sup> Upon fully decrypting the drive, Wayne discovers Luthor's files on several metahuman individuals across the globe. One of them is Prince herself, who is shown in a photo taken during <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>. Wayne admits to <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred Pennyworth</a> that he plans to steal the kryptonite to weaponize it, should it become necessary to fight Superman.
</p><p>At a Congressional hearing, as Finch questions Superman on the validity of his actions, a bomb smuggled by Luthor goes off and kills everyone present but Superman. Believing he should have detected the bomb, and frustrated by his failure to save them, Superman goes into self-imposed exile. Batman breaks into LexCorp and steals the kryptonite. In preparation to battle Superman, he builds a <a href="/wiki/Powered_exoskeleton" title="Powered exoskeleton">powered exoskeleton</a>, creates a kryptonite <a href="/wiki/Grenade_launcher" title="Grenade launcher">grenade launcher</a>, and a kryptonite-tipped spear. Meanwhile, Luthor enters the Kryptonian ship and accesses a vast technology database accumulated from over 100,000 worlds.
</p><p>To bring Superman out of exile, Luthor kidnaps Lois and <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_and_Martha_Kent" title="Jonathan and Martha Kent">Martha Kent</a>, Clark's adoptive mother. Lex throws Lois off the LexCorp building, but Superman quickly saves her and goes on to confront Luthor, who reveals to Superman that he manipulated Superman and Batman against each other by fueling their mutual distrust. Luthor demands that Superman kill Batman in exchange for Martha's life. Superman tries to explain the situation to Batman, but instead Batman attacks Superman and eventually subdues him with the aid of a kryptonite gas. Before Batman can kill Superman with the spear, Superman urges Batman to "save Martha", whose name is also shared with Batman's mother, confusing him long enough for Lois to arrive and explain what Superman meant. Realizing how far he has fallen and unwilling to let an innocent die, Batman rescues Martha, while Superman confronts Luthor on the scout ship.

When they are all outmatched, Superman realizes its vulnerability to kryptonite, and retrieves the spear to kill it. After impaling it with the spear, in the creature's last moments, it kills Superman, having been weakened himself by exposure to kryptonite.
</p><p>Luthor is arrested and Batman confronts him in prison, warning Luthor that he will always be watching him. Luthor gloats that Superman's death has made the world vulnerable to powerful alien threats. A memorial is held for Superman in Metropolis. Clark is also declared dead, with various friends and family members including Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince attending his funeral in <a href="/wiki/Smallville_(comics)" title="Smallville (comics)">Smallville</a>. Martha gives an envelope to Lois, which contains an engagement ring from Clark. After the funeral, Bruce expresses his regrets to Diana about how he failed Superman. He reveals to her that he plans to form a team of metahumans, starting with those from Luthor's files, to help protect the world in Superman's absence. After they leave, the dirt atop Clark's coffin levitates.
</p><p>In present-day <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>, <a href="/wiki/Wonder_Woman" title="Wonder Woman">Diana</a> receives a <a href="/wiki/Photographic_plate" title="Photographic plate">photographic plate</a> from <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Enterprises" title="Wayne Enterprises">Wayne Enterprises</a> of herself and four men taken during <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">World War I</a>, prompting her to recall her past. The daughter of <a href="/wiki/Hippolyta_(DC_Comics)" title="Hippolyta (DC Comics)">Queen Hippolyta</a>, Diana is raised on the hidden island of <a href="/wiki/Themyscira_(DC_Comics)" title="Themyscira (DC Comics)">Themyscira</a>, home to the <a href="/wiki/Amazons_(DC_Comics)" title="Amazons (DC Comics)">Amazonian</a> women warriors created by <a href="/wiki/Zeus_(DC_Comics)" title="Zeus (DC Comics)">Zeus</a> to protect mankind. Hippolyta explains the Amazonian history to Diana, including how <a href="/wiki/Ares_(DC_Comics)" title="Ares (DC Comics)">Ares</a> became jealous of humanity and orchestrated its destruction. When the other gods attempted to stop him, Ares killed all but Zeus, who used the last of his power to wound Ares and force his retreat. Before dying, Zeus left the Amazons the island and a weapon, the "Godkiller", to prepare them for Ares's return.
</p><p>Although she initially forbids Diana to be trained as a warrior, Hippolyta reluctantly agrees to let General <a href="/wiki/Antiope_(comics)" title="Antiope (comics)">Antiope</a>, Hippolyta's sister and Diana's aunt, train her, only more rigorously than any other warrior. In 1918, Diana, now a young woman, rescues US pilot Captain <a href="/wiki/Steve_Trevor" title="Steve Trevor">Steve Trevor</a> when his plane crashes off the Themysciran coast. The island is soon invaded by <a href="/wiki/Imperial_German_Navy" title="Imperial German Navy">German</a> soldiers that had been pursuing Trevor. The Amazons kill the crew, but Antiope sacrifices herself to save Diana. Steve is interrogated with the <a href="/wiki/Lasso_of_Truth" title="Lasso of Truth">Lasso of Hestia</a> and reveals that a <a href="/wiki/World_War_I" title="World War I">great war</a> is consuming the outside world and that he is an <a href="/wiki/Allies_of_World_War_I" title="Allies of World War I">Allied</a> spy. He has stolen a notebook of the chief chemist <a href="/wiki/Doctor_Poison" title="Doctor Poison">Dr. Isabel Maru</a>, who is attempting to engineer a deadlier form of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mustard_gas" title="Mustard gas">mustard gas</a> under the orders of General <a href="/wiki/Erich_Ludendorff" title="Erich Ludendorff">Erich Ludendorff</a> from a weapon facility in the <a href="/wiki/Ottoman_Empire" title="Ottoman Empire">Ottoman Empire</a>. Believing Ares to be responsible for the war, Diana arms herself with the "Godkiller" sword, the lasso, and armor before leaving Themyscira with Steve to locate and stop Ares for good.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, they deliver Maru's notebook to the Supreme War Council, where Sir Patrick Morgan is trying to negotiate an <a href="/wiki/Armistice" title="Armistice">armistice</a> with <a href="/wiki/German_Empire" title="German Empire">Germany</a>. Diana translates Maru's notes and reveals that the Germans plan to release the deadly gas at the <a href="/wiki/Western_Front_(World_War_I)" title="Western Front (World War I)">Western Front</a>. Although forbidden by his commander to act, Steve, with secret funding from Morgan, recruits spy Sameer, marksman Charlie, and smuggler Chief Napi to help prevent the gas from being released. The team reaches the front in <a href="/wiki/Belgium_in_World_War_I" title="Belgium in World War I">Belgium</a>. Diana goes alone through <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/No_Man%27s_Land" title="No Man's Land">No Man's Land</a> and captures the enemy trench, allowing the Allied forces to help her liberate the village of Veld. The team briefly celebrates, taking a photograph in the village, while Diana and Steve begin to develop their own romance.
</p><p>The team learns that a gala will be held at the nearby <a href="/wiki/Oberste_Heeresleitung" title="Oberste Heeresleitung">German High Command</a>. Steve and Diana separately infiltrate the party, with Steve intending to locate the gas and destroy it, and Diana hoping to kill Ludendorff, believing that he is Ares and thus killing him will end the war. Steve stops her to avoid jeopardizing his mission, but this allows Ludendorff to unleash the gas on Veld, killing its inhabitants. Blaming Steve for intervening, Diana pursues Ludendorff to a base where the gas is being loaded into a bomber aircraft bound for London. Diana fights and kills him, but is confused and disillusioned when his death does not stop the war.
</p><p>Morgan appears and reveals himself as Ares. He tells Diana that although he has subtly given humans ideas and inspirations, using Ludendorff and Maru as pawns in the process, it is ultimately their decision to resort to violence as they are inherently corrupt. When Diana attempts to kill Ares with the "Godkiller" sword, he destroys it, then reveals to Diana that she is the "Godkiller", as the daughter of Zeus and Hippolyta. He fails to persuade Diana to help him destroy mankind in order to restore paradise on Earth. While the two battle, Steve's team destroys Maru's laboratory. Steve hijacks and pilots the bomber carrying the poison to a safe altitude and detonates it, sacrificing himself. Ares attempts to direct Diana's rage and grief at Steve's death by convincing her to kill Maru, but the memories of her experiences with Steve cause her to realize that humans have good within them. She spares Maru and redirects Ares's lightning into him, killing him for good. Later, the team celebrates the <a href="/wiki/Armistice_of_11_November_1918" title="Armistice of 11 November 1918">end of the war</a>. In the present day, Diana sends an email to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bruce_Wayne" title="Bruce Wayne">Bruce Wayne</a> thanking him for the photographic plate of her and Steve and continues to fight and give on the world's behalf, understanding that only love can truly save the world.

They are placed under command of Colonel <a href="/wiki/Rick_Flag" title="Rick Flag">Rick Flag</a> to be used as disposable assets in high-risk missions for the United States government. A nanite bomb is implanted in the neck of each team member, designed to detonate should the member rebel or try to escape.
</p><p>One of Waller's intended recruits is Flag's girlfriend <a href="/wiki/Enchantress_(DC_Comics)" title="Enchantress (DC Comics)">Dr. June Moone</a>, an archaeologist possessed by a demonic witch known as the "Enchantress". She quickly turns on Waller, deciding to eradicate humankind with a mystical weapon for imprisoning her. She besieges <a href="/wiki/Midway_City_(DC_Comics)" title="Midway City (DC Comics)">Midway City</a> by transforming its populace into a horde of monsters, and summons her brother Incubus to assist her. Waller then deploys the squad to extract a high-profile mark from Midway, which is reported to be under a terrorist attack. Joining them is <a href="/wiki/Katana_(comics)" title="Katana (comics)">Katana</a>, a Japanese swordswoman.
</p><p>Harley's homicidal lover <a href="/wiki/Joker_(character)" title="Joker (character)">Joker</a> finds out about her predicament and tortures Belle Reve security officer Griggs into leading him to the facility where the nanite bombs are made. There, he blackmails Dr. Van Criss into disabling Harley's bomb. Upon arrival, the squad's helicopter is shot down, forcing them to proceed on foot to their target. Boomerang inaccurately convinces Slipknot that the bombs are a ruse to keep them in check, who attempts to escape and is killed. Meanwhile, the squad is ambushed by Enchantress' minions. They eventually fight their way through to a safe house, where they learn that their mark is Waller herself, who is attempting to cover up her involvement in Enchantress' siege.
</p><p>The squad escorts Waller to the rooftop for extraction, but the arriving helicopter has been hijacked by the Joker and his men, who open fire on the squad. Harley's bomb is disarmed by Dr. Van Criss, leaving Flag unable to execute her and allowing her to climb aboard the helicopter. Waller's men subsequently shoot down the helicopter, and Harley falls out while the Joker is presumed dead, after which Harley rejoins the squad. Alerted to Waller's whereabouts, Enchantress' minions arrive and kidnap her. Deadshot finds Waller's confidential files, from which he learns the truth about Enchantress, which Flag then is forced to confirm. This causes the squad members to abandon him. With Waller compromised, Flag relieves the squad of the mission but chooses to continue. Realizing they have an opportunity to prove themselves, they soon rejoin him and locate Enchantress at a partially-flooded subway station. Killer Croc and a group of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Navy_SEAL" title="Navy SEAL">Navy SEALs</a>, led by Lieutenant GQ Edwards, go underwater to plant a bomb underneath Incubus. El Diablo embraces his abilities and distracts Incubus long enough for the bomb to detonate underneath, killing them both as well as Edwards.
</p><p>The remaining squad members battle Enchantress together but are ultimately defeated. Enchantress offers to fulfill their deepest desires in exchange for their allegiance, and Harley feigns interest in order to get close enough to cut out Enchantress' heart. Killer Croc then throws explosives into Enchantress' weapon and Deadshot shoots them, destroying the device. Flag takes Enchantress' heart and crushes it, finally freeing June from the curse. Waller, still alive, emerges, and the squad members are returned to Belle Reve with ten years off their sentences. All but Captain Boomerang are allowed special privileges. The Joker, alive and unscathed, breaks into the penitentiary and rescues Harley. 
</p><p>In a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mid-credits_scene" title="Mid-credits scene">mid-credits scene</a>, Waller meets with <a href="/wiki/Batman" title="Batman">Bruce Wayne</a>, who agrees to protect her from the backlash against her role in Enchantress' rampage in exchange for access to the government's files on the expanding <a href="/wiki/Metahuman" title="Metahuman">metahuman</a> community. Waller then advises him to stop working late nights, to which Bruce answers her to shut down Task Force X or else he and his "friends" will do it.

Before any action can be taken, soldiers led by <a href="/wiki/General_Zod" title="General Zod">General Zod</a>, an old friend of El's, launch an uprising and arrest the councilors. Realising that Krypton is doomed, El steals the genetic codex sought by Zod and infuses them into the DNA of his infant son, Kal-El—the first naturally born Kryptonian child in centuries. Donning his old armor, El sacrifices his life to allow his son to escape on a preprogrammed spacecraft. The council quashes Zod's rebellion, and its members are sentenced to exile in the <a href="/wiki/Phantom_Zone" title="Phantom Zone">Phantom Zone</a> after being convicted of treason. Krypton explodes soon after.

Clark eventually becomes an isolated young man as a result of developing superhuman powers which he tries to hide from others. He then learns his true origins from Jonathan, who urges him to keep his powers hidden. Several years later, Jonathan dies in a tornado while refusing to let Clark rescue him. Burdened with guilt and looking for a new purpose in his life, Clark leaves to travel the world for an extended period of time under several disguises.

Disguised as a worker, Clark enters the ship and activates its central computer using a key left by Jor-El, which allows him to communicate with an artificial intelligence modeled after his father. The AI explains that Clark was sent to Earth to guide its people, and presents him with a Kryptonian uniform bearing his family's symbol. While following Clark, Lois inadvertently triggers the ship's security system. Clark uses his powers to rescue Lois before wearing the uniform and testing his flying abilities. Unable to convince supervisor <a href="/wiki/Perry_White" title="Perry White">Perry White</a> to publish an article on the incident, Lois tracks down Clark in Smallville, with the intent of exposing him. However, after hearing of Jonathan Kent's sacrifice, Lois drops the story, keeping Clark's identity safe, despite Perry's suspicions.
</p><p>Escaping the Phantom Zone, Zod and his crew intercept a transmission from the scout vessel and travel to Earth. Deducing that Kal-El is nearby, they broadcast a global address demanding that he surrender or risk war. Clark meets with the United States Air Force and agrees to comply, with Lois joining him as a hostage. Zod reveals that he possesses numerous <a href="/wiki/Terraforming" title="Terraforming">terraforming</a> devices, the largest called a World Engine, which he salvaged from Kryptonian outposts, which he intends to use to transform Earth into a new Krypton. His science officer, <a href="/wiki/Jax-Ur" title="Jax-Ur">Jax-Ur</a>, extracts Clark's genes to create Kryptonian colonists who will annihilate humanity and build a society based on Zod's ideals of genetic purity.
</p><p>Using the Jor-El AI to take over the ship, Clark and Lois flee and warn the U.S. military after an explosive confrontation between Clark and Zod's troops in Smallville, just as Zod orders an invasion. Zod deploys the World Engine from the Kryptonian ship, which touches down in the Indian Ocean and begins firing a beam through the planet towards the ship, severely damaging <a href="/wiki/Metropolis_(comics)" title="Metropolis (comics)">Metropolis</a>, and initiating the terraforming strategy. Given the codename "<a href="/wiki/Superman" title="Superman">Superman</a>", Clark destroys the terraforming platform while the military launches a suicide attack, sending Zod's troops back to the Phantom Zone. With the ship destroyed and Krypton's only hope of revival gone, Zod vows to destroy the Earth and its inhabitants just to spite Superman. The two Kryptonians engage in a lengthy battle across Metropolis, which concludes when Superman is forced to break Zod's neck as he attacks a family in a train station.
</p><p>Superman persuades the government to let him act independently, so long as he does not turn against humanity. To allow access to dangerous situations without attracting attention, Clark takes a job as a freelance reporter for the <i>Daily Planet</i>.

Although the group manages to rescue the kidnapped employees, the facility is flooded during combat, which traps the team until Curry helps delay the flood so they can escape. Stone retrieves the last Mother Box, which he had hidden, for the group to analyze. Stone reveals that his father used the Mother Box to rebuild Stone's body after an accident almost cost him his life. Wayne decides to use the Mother Box to resurrect Superman, not only to help them fight off Steppenwolf's invasion, but also to restore hope to mankind. Diana and Curry are hesitant about the idea, but Wayne forms a secret contingency plan in case Superman returns as hostile.

By calling Shazam's name, Billy is transformed into an adult superhero now endowed with the wizard's name; thanking Billy, Shazam the Wizard turns to dust, leaving behind his staff. Returning home, Freddy helps Billy explore the extent of his newfound powers: electricity manipulation, invulnerability, super strength, hyper speed, flight and super-intelligence. Freddy's <a href="/wiki/YouTube" title="YouTube">videos</a> of Shazam testing his powers become a viral sensation, and Billy begins skipping school to use his powers for money and fame in Shazam form.

Cipher hacks into the electronics systems of a large number of cars, causing them to drive automatically and taking out the convoy so that Dom can take the football. The team intercepts Dom, but Dom escapes, shooting and apparently killing Deckard in the process. Letty catches up to Dom, but is ambushed and nearly killed by Cipher's enforcer, Connor Rhodes, before Dom rescues her. In retaliation, Cipher has Rhodes execute Elena in front of Dom.
</p><p>Dom infiltrates a base in Russia to use the EMP device to disable their security and then to disable a <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_submarine" title="Nuclear submarine">nuclear submarine</a>, enabling Cipher to hijack it and attempt to use its arsenal to trigger a nuclear war. They are once again intercepted by the team, who attempt to shut down the sub, and then drive out toward the gates that would prevent the sub from leaving into open waters. Meanwhile, Deckard, whose death was faked, teams up with Owen, and at Magdalene's behest, infiltrates Cipher's plane to rescue Dom's son. Once Deckard reports that the child is safe, Dom turns on Cipher and kills Rhodes, avenging Elena's death, before rejoining his team. Outraged, Cipher fires an <a href="/wiki/Infrared_homing" title="Infrared homing">infrared homing</a> missile at Dom, but he breaks away from his team and maneuvers around it, causing the missile to hit the submarine instead. The team quickly forms a vehicular blockade around Dom, shielding him from the ensuing explosion.

Shaw flees by car, detonating his hideout and disabling most of the police, leaving Dom, Brian, Tej, Han, Gisele, Hobbs, and Riley to pursue him. Letty arrives to help Shaw, shooting Dom without hesitation before escaping. Back at their headquarters, Hobbs tells Dom's crew that Shaw is stealing components to create a deadly device, intending to sell it to the highest bidder. Meanwhile, Shaw's investigation into the opposing crew reveals Letty's relationship with Dom, but she is revealed to be suffering from amnesia. Dominic's crew learns that Shaw is connected to a drug lord who was imprisoned by Brian, Arturo Braga.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[N 2]</a></sup> Brian returns to Los Angeles as a prisoner to question Braga, who says Letty survived the explosion that seemingly killed her; Shaw took her in after discovering her amnesia.

After Letty leaves, Shaw offers Dom a chance to walk away, threatening to otherwise hurt his family, but Dom refuses. Tej tracks Shaw's next attack to a Spanish NATO base. Shaw's crew assaults a highway military convoy carrying a computer chip to complete his device. Dom's crew interferes, while Shaw, accompanied by Letty, commandeers a tank, destroying cars en route. Brian and Roman manage to flip the tank before it causes further damage, resulting in Letty being thrown from the vehicle and Dom risking his life to save her. Shaw and his crew are captured, but reveal Mia has been kidnapped by Shaw's henchmen Vegh and Klaus. Hobbs is forced to release Shaw, and Riley, revealed to be Shaw's covert accomplice, leaves with him; Letty chooses to remain with Dom.
</p><p>Shaw's group board a large moving aircraft on a runway as Dom's crew gives chase. Dom, Letty, and Brian board the craft; Brian rescues Mia, escaping in an onboard car. The plane attempts to take-off but is held down by excess weight as the rest of the team tether the plane to their vehicles. Gisele sacrifices herself to save Han from Shaw's henchman, who Han then kills. Letty kills Riley and escapes to safety, but Dom pursues Shaw and the computer chip. As the plane crashes into the ground, Shaw is thrown from it, seriously injuring him, and Dom drives a car out of the exploding plane. Dom reunites with his crew and gives the chip to Hobbs to secure their pardons. Dom and the others return to his old family home in Los Angeles. Hobbs and Elena, now working together, arrive to confirm the crew's freedom; Elena accepts that Dom loves Letty.

</p><p>When Dominic "Dom" Toretto is being transported to <a href="/wiki/Federal_Correctional_Institution,_Lompoc" title="Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc">Lompoc Prison</a> by bus, his sister Mia Toretto and friend Brian O'Conner lead an assault on the bus, causing it to crash and freeing Dom. While the authorities search for them, the trio escapes to <a href="/wiki/Rio_de_Janeiro" title="Rio de Janeiro">Rio de Janeiro</a>. Awaiting Dom's arrival, Mia and Brian join their friend Vince and other participants on a job to steal three cars from a train. Brian and Mia discover that agents from the <a href="/wiki/Drug_Enforcement_Administration" title="Drug Enforcement Administration">U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA)</a> are also on the train and that the cars are seized property. When Dom arrives with the rest of the participants, he realizes that the lead participant, Zizi, is only interested in stealing one car - a <a href="/wiki/Ford_GT40" title="Ford GT40">Ford GT40</a>. Dom has Mia steal the car herself before he and Brian fight Zizi and his henchmen, during which Zizi kills the DEA agents assigned to the vehicles. Dom and Brian are captured and brought to crime lord Hernan Reyes, the owner of the cars and Zizi's boss. Reyes orders the pair be interrogated to discover the location of the car, but they manage to escape and retreat to their safehouse.
</p><p>While Brian, Dom, and Mia examine the car to discover its importance, Vince arrives and is caught trying to remove a computer chip from it. He admits he was planning to sell the chip to Reyes on his own, and Dom forces him to leave. Brian investigates the chip and discovers it contains the complete financial details of Reyes' criminal empire, including the locations of US$100 million in cash.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Diplomatic_Security_Service" title="Diplomatic Security Service">Diplomatic Security Service</a> agent Luke Hobbs and his team arrive in Rio to arrest Dom and Brian. With the help of local officer Elena Neves, they travel to Dom's safehouse, but find it under assault by Reyes' men. Brian, Dom and Mia escape; Dom suggests they split up and leave Rio, but Mia announces she is pregnant with Brian's child. Dom agrees to stick together and suggests they steal the money from Reyes to start a new life. They organize a team to perform the heist: Han, Roman, Tej, Gisele, Leo, and Santos. Vince later joins the team after saving Mia from being captured by Reyes' men. The crew infiltrate one of Reyes' facilities and set fire to the money there, baiting him into consolidating his money at a single location - a secure vault inside a police station. 
</p><p>Hobbs and his team eventually find and arrest Dom, Mia, Brian, and Vince. While transporting them to the airport for <a href="/wiki/Extradition" title="Extradition">extradition</a> to the United States, the convoy is attacked by Reyes' men, who kill Hobbs' team. Hobbs and Elena are saved by Dom, Brian, Mia, and Vince as they fight back and escape, but Vince is shot in the process and dies. Wanting to avenge his murdered team, Hobbs and Elena agree to help with the heist. The gang break into the police station and tear the vault holding Reyes' money from the building using their cars, dragging it through the city. After an extensive police chase, Dom makes Brian continue without him while he attacks the police and the pursuing Reyes, using the vault attached to his car to smash their vehicles. Brian returns and kills Zizi while Reyes is badly injured by Dom's assault. Hobbs arrives on the scene and executes Reyes to avenge his team. Though Hobbs refuses to let Dom and Brian go free, he gives them a 24-hour head start to escape on the condition they leave the vault as it is. However, the vault is empty as it had been switched during the chase. After splitting the cash (Vince's share is given to his family), they go their separate ways.
</p><p>On a tropical beach, Brian and a visibly pregnant Mia relax. They are met by Dom and Elena. Brian challenges Dom to a final, no-stakes race to prove who is the better driver.

Dominic suspects that the police are on their trail, forcing the crew to disband and go their separate ways, with Han deciding to go to Tokyo. Realizing that he must leave, Dominic runs, leaving Letty behind to protect her from harm.
</p><p>Three months later, Dominic is now residing in <a href="/wiki/Panama_City" title="Panama City">Panama City</a>. He gets a call from his sister, Mia Toretto, who tells him that Letty has been murdered. Dominic heads back to Los Angeles to attend her funeral and examine the crash and finds traces of <a href="/wiki/Nitromethane" title="Nitromethane">nitromethane</a> on the ground. He visits the only car mechanic that sells nitromethane in LA and forces him into giving him the name David Park, the man who ordered the fuel, and informs him that the only car that uses nitromethane in the area is a green 1972 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ford_Gran_Torino" title="Ford Gran Torino">Ford Gran Torino</a> Sport.
</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</a> agent <a href="/wiki/Brian_O%27Conner" title="Brian O'Conner">Brian O'Conner</a> is trying to track down a Mexican drug lord, Arturo Braga. His search leads him to David Park, and he tracks him down using an illegal modification record on his car. Dominic arrives at Park's apartment first and hangs him out of the window by his ankles before Brian arrives. Brian saves Park and Park becomes the FBI's new informant. Park gets Brian into a <a href="/wiki/Street_racing" title="Street racing">street race</a>. Brian selects a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Modified_car" title="Modified car">modified</a> 2002 <a href="/wiki/Nissan_Skyline_GT-R" title="Nissan Skyline GT-R">Nissan Skyline GT-R</a> R34<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-11"><a href="#cite_note-11">[10]</a></sup> from the impound lot.

Dominic wins by bumping Brian's car while it is in nitro, making him lose control. Brian uses his power as an FBI agent to arrest another driver, Dwight Mueller, and takes his place on the team.
</p><p>The team meets up with Braga's personal henchman, Fenix, and Dominic notices that Fenix drives the same Torino the mechanic described. They drive across the border using underground tunnels to avoid detection. Brian has prior knowledge that after the heroin was delivered, Braga ordered the drivers to be killed. Upon discovering this, Dominic confronts Fenix and learns that he himself killed Letty when she tried to escape him. A stand-off ensues, though not before Dominic creates a diversion by loosening his car with nitrous – sparking a vehicle explosion that destroys his car and several others, including Brian's. In the ensuing chaos, Dominic and Brian hijack a 1999 <a href="/wiki/Hummer_H1" title="Hummer H1">Hummer H1</a> with $60 million worth of heroin in it. Dominic and Brian drive back to LA and hide the heroin in a police impound lot, where Brian picks up a modified <a href="/wiki/Subaru_Impreza" title="Subaru Impreza">Subaru Impreza</a> WRX STI Hatchback; they subsequently drive back to Dominic's house, where they reunite with Mia.
</p><p>Dominic finds out Brian was the last person to contact Letty, which results in Dominic attacking Brian until Brian explains that Letty was working undercover - she was tracking down Braga in exchange for clearing Dominic's record. Brian tells his superiors that in exchange for Dominic's pardon, he will lure Braga into a trap, forcing him to show up to exchange money for the heroin. At the drop site, the man who claims to be "Braga" is revealed as a decoy, and "Campos" – the real Braga – escapes with Fenix and the pair flee to <a href="/wiki/Mexico" title="Mexico">Mexico</a>. In the ensuing chaos, Fenix nearly runs over Gisele, before Dom saves her.
</p><p>Brian and Dominic travel to Mexico to catch Braga, with the help of Gisele, who gives them directions as a favor in return for Dom saving her life. Brian and Dom find him at a church and apprehend him. As Braga's henchmen try to rescue him, Brian and Dominic drive through the underground tunnels back to the United States. Brian crashes his car after taking fire from Braga's men. He is then injured after being <a href="/wiki/Side_collision" title="Side collision">T-boned</a> by Fenix. Before Fenix can kill Brian, Dominic drives into and kills Fenix. As police and helicopters approach the crash site on the American side of the border, Brian tells Dominic to leave, but Dominic refuses – saying he is not running anymore. Despite Brian's request for clemency, the judge sentences Dominic to 25 years to life. Brian resigns from the FBI and Dominic boards a prison bus that will transport him to <a href="/wiki/Federal_Correctional_Institution,_Lompoc" title="Federal Correctional Institution, Lompoc">Lompoc penitentiary</a>.

He subsequently relocates from <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a> to <a href="/wiki/Miami" title="Miami">Miami</a> and makes a living by participating in illegal street races, aided by his friend and local mechanic Tej Parker. Following one race against drivers Suki, Slap Jack, and Orange Julius, the police show up and Brian is arrested. He is taken into custody, but given a deal by his former boss, <a href="/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation" title="Federal Bureau of Investigation">FBI</a> Agent Bilkins, and U.S. Customs Agent Markham, to go undercover and bring down Argentinian drug lord Carter Verone in exchange for the erasure of his criminal record. Agent Monica Fuentes, who has been undercover with Verone for a year, agrees to assist bringing Brian into the organization. Brian agrees, but only if he is given permission to choose his own partner. 
</p><p>This prompts him to travel to <a href="/wiki/Barstow,_California" title="Barstow, California">Barstow, California</a>, where he enlists the help of Roman Pierce, his childhood friend who served jail time for housing stolen cars in a garage. Roman, currently on <a href="/wiki/Parole" title="Parole">parole</a>, blames Brian for his arrest, but reluctantly agrees to help in exchange for the same deal Brian was offered. Roman and Brian are later hired by Verone, who tasks the duo to compete against rival drivers to obtain a package from a confiscated car located in a lot. Markham, who mistakenly thinks that the duo are trying to run away, follows them to the lot. However, Roman relents, and shoots at Markham to help maintain his cover. He later confronts him for interference with the mission. Brian is able to gain knowledge of the plan, however, and tells Bilkins that Verone is reportedly aiming to launder his money in Miami, before escaping on his private jet.
</p><p>Later, the team challenges a pair of <a href="/wiki/Muscle_car" title="Muscle car">muscle car</a> drivers they raced when competing for Verone's hiring, for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pink_slip_racing" title="Pink slip racing">pink slips</a>. Despite engine and power output handicaps, Brian and Roman manage to win the race and the other two cars. Meanwhile, Roman confronts Brian about his attraction to Monica and the constant threat of Verone's men. However, the two men patch up their differences, and focus on completing the mission.
</p><p>After witnessing Verone torture <a href="/wiki/Detective" title="Detective">Detective</a> Whitworth of the <a href="/wiki/Miami_Police_Department" title="Miami Police Department">Miami Police Department</a> into giving them a window of opportunity to make their getaway, Brian and Roman are warned by Monica that they will be killed once the drop is made. However, Markham refuses to call off the job, claiming that it's their one chance to catch Verone and before they leave, Brian and Monica kiss.
</p><p>On the day of the mission, Brian and Roman begin transporting duffel bags of Verone's money, with Verone's right-hand men, Enrique and Roberto, riding alongside to accompany the duo. Before the window is set, Whitworth decides to call in the police to move in for an arrest of the drivers of the cars used by Brian and Roman. This results in a high-speed chase across the city. The duo leads the police to a warehouse, where a "scramble" by dozens of street racers organized by Tej disorients the police. Following the scramble, the police manage to pull over the cars, only to find out that they were driven by Tej and Suki. As it turns out, the duo had switched cars and had escaped in the two muscle cars they had won earlier.
</p><p>As Brian approaches the destination point in a <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet_Camaro_(first_generation)" title="Chevrolet Camaro (first generation)">Yenko Camaro</a>, Enrique tells him to take the Tarpon Point Marina exit, instead of heading to the airfield.

Verone reveals he knew Monica was an undercover agent, and purposely gave her wrong information on the destination point. When Brian arrives at the Marina, Verone forces Monica onto his private yacht and orders Enrique to kill Brian. As Enrique prepares to kill him, Brian's ejector seat fails, but Roman suddenly appears and helps Brian to incapacitate Enrique. Verone makes his escape, but Brian and Roman use the Camaro to drive off a ramp, crashing on top of the yacht. Brian shoots and wounds Verone, who is then arrested by Monica. 
</p><p>Markham grants Brian and Roman full pardons, and in return Roman turns over the second half of Verone's money. The two agree to stay in Miami, and Brian suggests opening a garage - funded by a cut of Verone's money that Roman kept for themselves.
</p><p>On the docks outside <a href="/wiki/Los_Angeles" title="Los Angeles">Los Angeles</a>, a truck is loaded with electronics, and a dockside worker notifies an anonymous person about the shipment. On the road, the truck is approached by three modified <a href="/wiki/Honda_Civic_(fifth_generation)#Coupé" title="Honda Civic (fifth generation)">Honda Civics</a> with green underglow. The perpetrators then proceed to harpoon and board the truck, knock out the driver, and corral the semi allowing them to heist the electronics and escape into the night.

Dominic's team, which consists of his friends Vince, Leon, Jesse, and his girlfriend Letty, arrive. Vince, who has a crush on Mia, engages in a rough struggle with Brian, which Dominic is forced to break up.

Dominic organizes a drag race with himself, Brian, and two other drivers. Brian, out of cash, wagers the pink slip for his car. During the race, Brian damages the intake manifold on his engine, handing the victory to Dominic. But as Brian prepares to hand over his car, the LAPD arrives, forcing everyone to flee. Dominic parks his car in a garage to limit suspicions by walking home, but is immediately spotted by a police cruiser. Brian arrives and saves him from the cops. The duo unknowingly venture into the territory of Dominic's old racing rival, gang leader Johnny Tran and his cousin, Lance Nguyen. After confronting Brian and Dominic, Tran and Lance destroy Brian's car. Afterwards, Dominic reminds Brian that he owes him a car as a price for losing the race.
</p><p>Brian goes to Dominic's garage, where he brings a totaled <a href="/wiki/Toyota_Supra#A80" title="Toyota Supra">Toyota Supra</a> as a replacement for the Eclipse. As Dominic and his crew begin the process of repairing the car, Brian begins dating Mia. Brian investigates Tran, convinced that he is responsible for the truck hijackings. One night during an investigation of a garage, he is cornered by Vince and Dominic, who demand an explanation. Brian lies about checking the cars of his rivals for the upcoming <a href="/wiki/Race_Wars_(The_Fast_and_the_Furious)" title="Race Wars (The Fast and the Furious)">Race Wars</a>, a street racing event in the desert. Brian, Vince, and Dominic then check out Tran's garage, and while there, Brian notices a large shipment of electronics in the garage.
</p><p>Brian reports the batch of electronics to his superiors, and they arrest Tran and Lance. The raid turns out to be a bust, however, as it turns out the electronics had been purchased legally, and despite his doubts, Brian is now forced to assume that Dominic is the actual coordinator of the truck heists. Brian's superiors then give him just 36 hours to find the perpetrators, as the truckers are now arming themselves to defend against hijackings.
</p><p>The next day, with the Supra restored, Dominic invites Brian to Race Wars, and he tells them that they will talk after Brian has proven himself. At Race Wars, Jesse wagers his father's <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Jetta#Mk3" title="Volkswagen Jetta">Volkswagen Jetta</a> to Tran, but flees with the car after he loses. Tran confronts Dominic to claim the car, and accuses him of reporting him to the police. Outraged, Dominic attacks Tran. Later that night, Brian notices the crew leaving, and realizes that Dominic and his crew are the hijackers. He then reveals his true identity to Mia, who is infuriated, but Brian compels her to reveal the location of the vehicles and aid him in his plans.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Dominic, Letty, Vince, and Leon prepare to hijack a semi-trailer truck, which is also to be their last heist. However, the truck driver is armed, and Vince becomes trapped on the side of the truck and shot by the driver, while the driver causes Letty to be run off the road. Brian soon arrives with Mia, who commandeers the Supra while Brian rescues Vince. When Dominic arrives, Brian is forced to blow his cover and call for a <a href="/wiki/Medical_evacuation" title="Medical evacuation">medical evacuation</a> to rescue Vince. Dominic leaves with Mia and the rest of the crew after Vince is saved.
</p><p>Brian arrives at Dominic's house, and sees him pull his father's <a href="/wiki/Dodge_Charger_(B-body)#1970" title="Dodge Charger (B-body)">1970 Dodge Charger R/T</a> out of the garage. Brian confronts Dominic regarding Jesse's whereabouts, pushing him to seek police assistance. Jesse soon arrives, apologizing for his actions, and pleads for protection against Tran and Lance. He is then killed in a <a href="/wiki/Drive-by_shooting" title="Drive-by shooting">drive-by shooting</a> by Tran and Lance. Dominic and Brian pursue them, with Dominic ramming Lance's bike off the road before Brian shoots Tran, who totals his bike into a curb. Brian then sees and pursues Dominic, culminating in a quarter-mile drag race. The race ends as they barely manage to cross a railroad crossing before a train passes by, but Dominic violently crashes into a semi-truck. Instead of arresting Dominic, Brian gives him the keys to his own car, telling him he still owes him a ten-second car; Dominic is then able to escape. Brian then walks away, now a fugitive.

</p><p>To repay his debt for the car he destroyed, Sean agrees to work for Han. This leads to the duo becoming friends, with Han agreeing to teach Sean how to drift. Han also loans him a <a href="/wiki/Mitsubishi_Lancer_Evolution" title="Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution">Mitsubishi Lancer Evolution</a> for future races, explaining that he is helping him as Sean is the only person willing to stand up to Takashi. Sean moves in with Han and soon masters drifting, gaining some clout after defeating DK's right-hand man, Morimoto. Sean soon asks Neela out on a date, and learns that after her mother died, she moved in with Takashi's grandmother, which resulted in their relationship. Takashi beats up Sean the next day, telling him to stay away from Neela; Neela subsequently leaves Takashi and moves in with Sean and Han.

During the chase, Morimoto is killed in a crash, leaving Takashi to pursue the trio on his own. Han allows Sean to overtake him in order to hold Takashi off, but the chase ends when Sean and Neela crash. Meanwhile, moments after escaping from Takashi, Han is critically injured from a <a href="/wiki/Side_collision" title="Side collision">t-bone collision</a>. Han's car explodes, dying instantly just seconds before Sean has a chance to save him.
</p><p>Takashi, Sean, and his father become involved in an armed standoff which is resolved by Neela agreeing to leave with Takashi. Twinkie gives his money to Sean to replace the money Han stole, which Sean then returns to Kamata. Sean proposes a race against Takashi, with the loser having to leave Tokyo. Kamata agrees to the challenge, but on the condition that the race take place on a mountain, revealed to be the mountain where Takashi himself is the only person to make it down successfully. With all of Han's cars impounded, Sean and Han's friends then rebuild a 1967 <a href="/wiki/Ford_Mustang_(first_generation)" title="Ford Mustang (first generation)">Ford Mustang</a> that Sean's father was working on, with a <a href="/wiki/Nissan_Skyline_GT-R" title="Nissan Skyline GT-R">Nissan Skyline</a> <a href="/wiki/Nissan_RB_engine#RB26DETT" title="Nissan RB engine">engine</a> salvaged from Han's Silvia that was totaled by Sean in his first drift race, and other spare parts.
</p><p>That night, on the mountain, crowds gather to see the race; Takashi takes the lead initially, but Sean's training allows him to catch up.

Agent <a href="/wiki/Phil_Coulson" title="Phil Coulson">Phil Coulson</a> explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a <a href="/wiki/Wormhole" title="Wormhole">wormhole</a>, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a few other agents, including <a href="/wiki/Hawkeye_(comics)" title="Hawkeye (comics)">Clint Barton</a>, to aid him in his getaway.
</p><p>In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the "<a href="/wiki/Avengers_(comics)" title="Avengers (comics)">Avengers Initiative</a>". Agent <a href="/wiki/Black_Widow_(Natasha_Romanova)" title="Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)">Natasha Romanoff</a> is sent to <a href="/wiki/Kolkata" title="Kolkata">Calcutta</a> to recruit <a href="/wiki/Bruce_Banner_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)" title="Bruce Banner (Marvel Cinematic Universe)">Dr. Bruce Banner</a> to trace the Tesseract through its <a href="/wiki/Gamma_ray" title="Gamma ray">gamma radiation</a> emissions.

</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Stuttgart" title="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>, Barton steals <a href="/wiki/Iridium" title="Iridium">iridium</a> needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., <a href="/wiki/Thor_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)" title="Thor (Marvel Cinematic Universe)">Thor</a>, his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the <a href="/wiki/Helicarrier" title="Helicarrier">Helicarrier</a>. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.
</p><p>The Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk falls to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above <a href="/wiki/Stark_Tower" title="Stark Tower">Stark Tower</a> to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.
</p><p>Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's location. Banner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians. The Hulk finds Loki and beats him into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at <a href="/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan" title="Midtown Manhattan">Midtown Manhattan</a>. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed.

As Claire and Owen search for the boys, they barely escape the <i>Indominus</i>. Masrani and two troopers hunt the <i>Indominus</i> by helicopter but it breaks into the park's aviary, releasing <a href="/wiki/Pterosaur" title="Pterosaur">pterosaurs</a> – <i><a href="/wiki/Pteranodon" title="Pteranodon">Pteranodon</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Dimorphodon" title="Dimorphodon">Dimorphodon</a></i> species – which collide with the helicopter, causing it to crash. The pterosaurs then attack the resort; in the chaos, Zara is carried off by pterosaurs before being devoured by the park's <i><a href="/wiki/Mosasaurus" title="Mosasaurus">Mosasaurus</a></i>. Claire and Owen find Zach and Gray as armed personnel shoot down swarming pterosaurs.
</p><p>Assuming command after Masrani's death, Hoskins orders that the raptors be used to track the <i>Indominus</i>; Owen, forced to comply, leads the raptors. They find the <i>Indominus</i> and the animals begin communicating among themselves. Owen realizes the <i>Indominus</i> has <i>Velociraptor</i> <a href="/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a>; it becomes the pack's new <a href="/wiki/Alpha_(ethology)" title="Alpha (ethology)">alpha</a>, usurping Owen's dominance. Troops fire on the <i>Indominus</i> but it escapes. The raptors kill most of the troops, but one raptor is killed. Hoskins evacuates Wu and the dinosaur embryos from the island to protect Wu's research. Owen, Claire, and the boys find Hoskins at the lab but a raptor breaks in and kills him.
</p><p>Owen re-establishes his bond with the three raptors before the <i>Indominus</i> reappears. They attack the <i>Indominus</i> but two are killed. Claire releases the park's <i><a href="/wiki/Tyrannosaurus" title="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></i> and lures it into a battle with the <i>Indominus</i>, which overpowers the <i>T. rex</i> until Blue, the surviving raptor, joins the fight. Overwhelmed, the <i>Indominus</i> is cornered at the lagoon's edge, where the <i><a href="/wiki/Mosasaurus" title="Mosasaurus">Mosasaurus</a></i> drags it underwater. The survivors are evacuated and the island is abandoned. Zach and Gray are reunited with their parents; Owen and Claire decide to stay together.

</p><p>A <a href="/wiki/United_States_Senate" title="United States Senate">U.S. Senate</a> hearing in <a href="/wiki/Washington,_D.C." title="Washington, D.C.">Washington, D.C.</a> debates whether Isla Nublar's dinosaurs should be saved from an impending volcanic eruption. Mathematician <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Dr._Ian_Malcolm" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Dr. Ian Malcolm</a> testifies that the dinosaurs should be allowed to perish to correct <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#John_Hammond" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">John Hammond</a>'s mistake of <a href="/wiki/Cloning" title="Cloning">cloning</a> them. Meanwhile, Jurassic World's former operations manager, Claire Dearing, has established the Dinosaur Protection Group to save the animals. After the Senate rules against rescuing the dinosaurs, Hammond's former partner, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Sir_Benjamin_Lockwood" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Benjamin Lockwood</a>, summons Claire to his <a href="/wiki/Northern_California" title="Northern California">Northern California</a> estate. Lockwood and his aide, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Eli_Mills" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Eli Mills</a>, reveal a plan to relocate the dinosaurs to a new island sanctuary. Claire is needed to reactivate the park's dinosaur <a href="/wiki/GPS_wildlife_tracking" title="GPS wildlife tracking">tracking system</a> to locate the animals, particularly Blue, the last surviving <i><a href="/wiki/Velociraptor" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a></i>. Though now estranged, Claire recruits Owen Grady, Jurassic World's former <i>Velociraptor</i> trainer and Blue's alpha, to help capture her.
</p><p>On Isla Nublar, Claire and former park technician <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Franklin_Webb" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Franklin Webb</a> reactivate the online <a href="/wiki/GPS_wildlife_tracking" title="GPS wildlife tracking">tracking system</a>. Owen, paleo-veterinarian <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Dr._Zia_Rodriguez" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Zia Rodriguez</a>, and a mercenary team led by <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Ken_Wheatley" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Ken Wheatley</a>, track and find Blue. The encounter escalates, resulting in Blue being shot and Wheatley <a href="/wiki/Sedative" title="Sedative">tranquilizing</a> Owen. 
Wheatley then abandons Owen, Claire, and Franklin on the island while forcibly taking Zia to treat Blue's injury. The mercenary ship, loaded with the captured dinosaurs, departs for the <a href="/wiki/Contiguous_United_States" title="Contiguous United States">U.S. mainland</a> as the animals left behind die in the eruption. Claire, Franklin, and Owen sneak aboard the ship and help Zia <a href="/wiki/Blood_transfusion" title="Blood transfusion">transfuse</a> Blue with <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> blood. The group realize that the captured dinosaurs are being transported to an unidentified location for an unknown purpose.
</p><p>At the estate, Lockwood's orphaned pre-teen granddaughter <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Maisie_Lockwood" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Maisie</a> overhears Mills and auctioneer <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Gunnar_Eversol" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Gunnar Eversol</a> secretly planning to auction the captured dinosaurs on the <a href="/wiki/Black_market" title="Black market">black market</a>. They will also unveil the <i><a href="/wiki/List_of_cloned_animals_in_the_Jurassic_Park_series#Indoraptor" title="List of cloned animals in the Jurassic Park series">Indoraptor</a></i>, a new <a href="/wiki/Genetic_engineering" title="Genetic engineering">genetically-modified</a> dinosaur created by geneticist <a href="/wiki/List_of_Jurassic_Park_characters#Dr._Henry_Wu" title="List of Jurassic Park characters">Dr. Henry Wu</a> using <i>Indominus rex</i> and <i>Velociraptor</i> DNA. Wu wants Blue's DNA to create an enhanced <i>Indoraptor</i> that is obedient to commands, unaware that Blue's blood has been contaminated. After Maisie informs Lockwood about the auction, he confronts Mills, who murders him. Maisie is later revealed to have been cloned from Lockwood's deceased daughter and is the reason John Hammond, who opposed <a href="/wiki/Human_cloning" title="Human cloning">human cloning</a>, ended their association.
</p><p>The dinosaurs are transported to Lockwood's estate and caged. Zia and Franklin narrowly evade capture, but Owen and Claire are apprehended. Owen incites a <i><a href="/wiki/Stygimoloch" title="Stygimoloch">Stygimoloch</a></i> into breaking open their cell. They find Maisie, who leads them to the auction where the <i>Indoraptor</i> is being sold despite Wu's protests that it is a prototype. Owen disrupts the proceedings by luring the <i>Stygimoloch</i> into the room. In the ensuing chaos, Wheatley tranquilizes the <i>Indoraptor</i> and extracts a tooth as a trophy, but it feigns sedation killing him, Eversol, and others as it escapes. The <i>Indoraptor</i> then hunts Owen, Claire, and Maisie throughout the mansion. Zia releases Blue, who attacks the <i>Indoraptor</i>, causing it to fall through a glass roof to its death.
</p><p>When a <a href="/wiki/Hydrogen_cyanide" title="Hydrogen cyanide">hydrogen cyanide</a> gas leak threatens the caged dinosaurs, Maisie frees them, despite Owen's objections. Mills attempts to flee with the <i>Indominus rex</i> bone but is devoured by the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i>, which tramples the bone. Owen, Claire, Maisie, Zia, and Franklin safely escape, while Blue and the other released dinosaurs flee the estate grounds.
</p><p>In a new U.S. Senate hearing, Dr. Malcolm declares the beginning of a Neo-Jurassic Age, where humans and dinosaurs must learn to coexist. The closing scenes depict freed dinosaurs roaming wilderness and outer urban areas.
</p><p>Industrialist John Hammond and his <a href="/wiki/Biological_engineering" title="Biological engineering">bioengineering</a> company, InGen, have created a <a href="/wiki/Animal_theme_park" title="Animal theme park">theme park</a> featuring cloned dinosaurs and prehistoric plants, called Jurassic Park, on <a href="/wiki/Isla_Nublar" title="Isla Nublar">Isla Nublar</a>, a <a href="/wiki/Costa_Rica" title="Costa Rica">Costa Rican</a> island. After a dinosaur handler is killed by a <i><a href="/wiki/Velociraptor" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a></i>, the park's investors, represented by lawyer Donald Gennaro, demand that experts visit the park and certify it is safe. To perform the inspection, Gennaro invites <a href="/wiki/Mathematician" title="Mathematician">mathematician</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chaos_theory" title="Chaos theory">chaos theorist</a> Ian Malcolm, while Hammond invites <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paleontologist" title="Paleontologist">paleontologist</a> Dr. Alan Grant and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paleobotanist" title="Paleobotanist">paleobotanist</a> Dr. Ellie Sattler. Upon arrival, the group is shocked to see a live <i><a href="/wiki/Brachiosaurus" title="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a></i>, in addition to two more with a herd of <i><a href="/wiki/Parasaurolophus" title="Parasaurolophus">Parasaurolophus</a></i>.
</p><p>At the park's visitor center, the group learns the cloning was accomplished by extracting <a href="/wiki/Ancient_DNA" title="Ancient DNA">dinosaur DNA</a> from <a href="/wiki/Mosquito" title="Mosquito">mosquitoes</a> preserved in <a href="/wiki/Amber" title="Amber">amber</a>. DNA from <a href="/wiki/Frog" title="Frog">frogs</a> was used to fill in gaps in the dinosaurs' <a href="/wiki/Genome" title="Genome">genome</a>. To prevent breeding, all the dinosaurs were made female. Malcolm scoffs at the idea, saying it will inevitably break down. The group witnesses the hatching of a baby <i><a href="/wiki/Velociraptor" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptor</a></i> and visits the raptor enclosure. At lunch, the group debates the <a href="/wiki/Ethics_of_cloning" title="Ethics of cloning">ethics of cloning</a> and the creation of the park. Malcolm gives a harsh warning about the implications of <a href="/wiki/Genetic_engineering" title="Genetic engineering">genetic engineering</a>.
</p><p>The group is joined by Hammond's grandchildren, Tim and Lex, for a tour of the park, while Hammond oversees the tour from the park's control room. The tour does not go as planned. Most of the dinosaurs fail to appear and the group encounters a sick <i><a href="/wiki/Triceratops" title="Triceratops">Triceratops</a></i>. It is cut short as a <a href="/wiki/Tropical_cyclone" title="Tropical cyclone">tropical storm</a> approaches Isla Nublar. Most park employees leave for the mainland on a boat, while the visitors return to their electric tour vehicles. Sattler stays behind with the park's veterinarian to study the <i>Triceratops</i>.
</p><p>Jurassic Park's lead computer programmer, Dennis Nedry, has been bribed by Dodgson, a man working for Hammond's corporate rival, to steal fertilized dinosaur <a href="/wiki/Embryo" title="Embryo">embryos</a>. Nedry deactivates the park's security system to gain access to the embryo storage room and puts the stolen embryos inside a canister disguised as a <a href="/wiki/Barbasol" title="Barbasol">Barbasol</a> shaving-cream can. The power goes out, stalling the tour vehicles. Most of the park's electric fences are deactivated, allowing the <i><a href="/wiki/Tyrannosaurus" title="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></i> to escape and attack the group. Grant and Hammond's grandchildren survive. The <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> injures Malcolm and devours Gennaro. While taking the embryos to the island's dock, Nedry becomes lost in the rain, crashes his <a href="/wiki/Jeep_Wrangler" title="Jeep Wrangler">Jeep Wrangler</a>, and is killed by a <i><a href="/wiki/Dilophosaurus" title="Dilophosaurus">Dilophosaurus</a></i>.
</p><p>Sattler helps the park's game warden, Robert Muldoon, search for survivors. They find only Malcolm before the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> returns. Grant, Tim, and Lex take shelter in a treetop. They later discover broken dinosaur egg shells. Grant concludes the dinosaurs have been breeding. This occurred because their West African frog DNA—<a href="/wiki/Common_reed_frog" title="Common reed frog">Common reed frog</a> can change their sex in a single-sex environment, allowing the dinosaurs to do so as well, proving Malcolm right.
</p><p>Unable to decipher Nedry's code to reactivate the security system, Hammond and the park's chief engineer Ray Arnold reboot the park's system. The group shuts down the park's grid and retreats to an emergency bunker, while Arnold heads to a maintenance shed to complete the rebooting process. When Arnold fails to return, Sattler and Muldoon head to the shed. They discover the shutdown has deactivated the remaining fences and released the <i>Velociraptors</i>. Muldoon distracts the raptors, while Sattler goes to turn the power back on. As she is turning the power on, Grant, Lex and Tim are climbing the perimeter fence. Grant and Lex make it down in time but Tim is electrocuted. Grant gives Tim <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CPR" title="CPR">CPR</a> and he survives. Sattler is attacked by a raptor and discovers Arnold's severed arm. Muldoon is caught off guard and killed by the other two raptors.
</p><p>After encountering a <i><a href="/wiki/Brachiosaurus" title="Brachiosaurus">Brachiosaurus</a></i> and narrowly escaping the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> during a <i><a href="/wiki/Gallimimus" title="Gallimimus">Gallimimus</a></i> stampede, Grant, Tim, and Lex reach the visitor center. Grant heads out to look for Sattler, leaving Tim and Lex inside. They are pursued by the raptors in an industrial kitchen but escape and join Grant and Sattler. Lex restores full power from the control room, allowing them to call Hammond, who in turn calls for help. Grant, Tim, Lex, and Sattler are cornered by the raptors, but they escape when the <i>Tyrannosaurus</i> suddenly appears and kills the raptors. Hammond arrives in a jeep with Malcolm, and the survivors board a helicopter to leave the island.
</p><p>On Isla Sorna, off the Pacific coast of Costa Rica, a girl named Cathy Bowman wanders around during a family vacation, and survives an attack by a swarm of <i><a href="/wiki/Compsognathus" title="Compsognathus">Compsognathus</a></i>. Her parents file a lawsuit against the genetics company <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/InGen" title="InGen">InGen</a>, now headed by John Hammond's nephew, Peter Ludlow, who plans to use Isla Sorna to recover losses from the <a href="/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="Jurassic Park (film)">incident that occurred at Jurassic Park four years earlier</a>. Mathematician Dr. Ian Malcolm meets Hammond who explains Isla Sorna is where InGen created their dinosaurs before moving them to Jurassic Park on <a href="/wiki/Isla_Nublar" title="Isla Nublar">Isla Nublar</a>. He hopes to stop InGen by sending a team to Isla Sorna to document the dinosaurs and attract support against human interference on the island. Malcolm, who survived the Jurassic Park disaster, is reluctant. After learning his girlfriend, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Paleontologist" title="Paleontologist">paleontologist</a> Dr. Sarah Harding, is part of the team and is already on Isla Sorna, he agrees to go to the island but only to retrieve her.
</p><p>Malcolm meets his teammates, Eddie Carr, an equipment specialist and engineer, and Nick Van Owen, a video documentarian and activist. Arriving on the island, they locate Sarah and discover Malcolm's daughter, Kelly, stowed away in a trailer being used as a mobile base. They watch an InGen team arrive to capture several dinosaurs. The team is led by <a href="/wiki/Big-game_hunting" title="Big-game hunting">big game hunter</a> Roland Tembo, and includes his second-in-command Dieter Stark, his hunting partner and friend Ajay Sidhu, mercenaries, hunters, paleontologist Robert Burke, and Ludlow. Tembo hopes to capture a male <i><a href="/wiki/Tyrannosaurus" title="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></i> by luring it using the cries of its injured infant. That night, Malcolm's team sneak into the InGen camp and learn the captured dinosaurs will be taken to a newly proposed <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Theme_park" title="Theme park">theme park</a> in <a href="/wiki/San_Diego" title="San Diego">San Diego</a> that was abandoned for the islands. This prompts Nick and Sarah to free the caged dinosaurs, wreaking havoc on the camp.
</p><p>Nick frees the infant <i>T. rex</i> and takes it to the trailer to mend its broken leg. After securing Kelly with Eddie, Malcolm realizes the infant's parents are searching for it and rushes to the trailer. As he arrives, the infant's parents emerge from both sides of the trailer. The infant is released to the adults, who attack the trailer, pushing it over the edge of a cliff. Eddie arrives, but as he tries to retrieve the trailer with an SUV, the adult <i>T. rexes</i> return and devour him. The vehicles plummet off the cliff. Malcolm, Sarah, Nick, and Kelly are rescued by the InGen team. With both groups' communications equipment and vehicles destroyed, they team up to search for the old InGen compound's radio station. Lost in the forest, Stark is killed by a pack of <i><a href="/wiki/Compsognathus" title="Compsognathus">Compsognathus</a></i>.
</p><p>The following night, the adult <i>T. rexes</i> find the group's camp by following the infant's blood scent on Sarah's jacket. The female <i>T. rex</i> chases the group to a waterfall cave and devours Burke; Roland tranquilizes the male. Ajay and most of the remaining InGen team are killed by <i><a href="/wiki/Velociraptor" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptors</a></i> while fleeing through a long grass field. Nick runs to the communications center at the Worker's Village to call for rescue. After Malcolm, Sarah and Kelly reach the village, they evade raptors until a helicopter arrives and transports them, and Nick, off the island.
</p><p>A freighter transporting the male <i>T. rex</i> to San Diego crashes into the dock. Finding the ship's crew dead, a guard opens the cargo hold and accidentally releases the <i>T. rex</i> into the city which then goes on a destructive rampage. Malcolm and Sarah retrieve the infant <i>T. rex</i> from InGen's unfinished Jurassic Park San Diego facility and use it to lure the adult back to the ship. Ludlow tries to intervene but is trapped in the cargo hold and maimed by the adult <i>T. rex</i>. He is subsequently mauled to death by the infant. Before the adult can escape again, Sarah tranquilizes it while Malcolm closes the cargo hold doors. The <i>T. rexes</i> are escorted back to Isla Sorna, and Hammond says that the American and Costa Rican governments have agreed to declare the island a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nature_preserve" title="Nature preserve">nature preserve</a>, securing it from human interference. While Malcolm sits at home with his family, the <i>T. rexes</i> are seen grazing with their infant as Hammond, regarding Malcolm's knowledge, affirms that "life will find a way".
</p><p>Ben Hildebrand and 12-year-old Eric Kirby go parasailing, tethered to a boat, in the waters around <a href="/wiki/Jurassic_Park#InGen" title="Jurassic Park">Isla Sorna</a>. The boat's crew mysteriously disappears, forcing Ben to detach the line. He and Eric drift towards the island.
</p><p>In the United States, <a href="/wiki/Paleontology" title="Paleontology">paleontologist</a> and <a href="/wiki/Jurassic_Park_(film)" title="Jurassic Park (film)">Jurassic Park</a> survivor Dr. Alan Grant has made a new discovery about the intelligence of <i><a href="/wiki/Velociraptor" title="Velociraptor">Velociraptors</a></i>, but struggles to secure funding for his research because of <a href="/wiki/The_Lost_World:_Jurassic_Park" title="The Lost World: Jurassic Park">an incident at San Diego</a> that has revealed the existence of the <a href="/wiki/De-extinction#Cloning" title="De-extinction">de-extinct</a> dinosaurs. Grant discusses his discovery of a resonating <a href="/wiki/Larynx" title="Larynx">larynx</a> on fossilized raptor remains with his former lover and colleague Dr. Ellie Sattler. This, and his experience at Jurassic Park, leads him to believe the original <i>Velociraptors</i> were socially sophisticated. He hypothesizes that if they had not gone extinct and continued to evolve, their descendants—rather than humans—would have become Earth's dominant species. His assistant Billy Brennan uses a <a href="/wiki/3D_printing" title="3D printing">3D printer</a> to replicate the <i>Velociraptor</i> larynx.
</p><p>Paul and Amanda Kirby offer funding for Grant's research if he will fly them around Isla Sorna. Grant reluctantly agrees and flies there with Paul, Amanda, Billy, and the Kirbys' mercenary associates Udesky, Cooper, and their pilot Nash. During the flight, Grant learns that the Kirbys plan to land on the island; he protests but Cooper knocks him unconscious.
</p><p>Grant awakens to discover they have landed. A <i><a href="/wiki/Spinosaurus" title="Spinosaurus">Spinosaurus</a></i> approaches the group, who board the plane to escape without Cooper. The <i>Spinosaurus</i> devours Cooper on the runway and the plane crashes into the forest. The <i>Spinosaurus</i> destroys the plane, killing Nash. Fleeing, the survivors briefly lose the <i>Spinosaurus</i> but encounter a <i><a href="/wiki/Tyrannosaurus" title="Tyrannosaurus">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></i>. The <i>Spinosaurus</i> returns but the group escapes while the two dinosaurs fight. The <i>Spinosaurus</i> breaks the <i>T. rex</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s neck.
</p><p>Grant learns the Kirbys are a middle-class, divorced couple who are looking for their son Eric and Amanda's boyfriend Ben, who are missing on the island. The group finds the parasail attached to Ben's corpse. They take the parasail and then encounter raptor nests, and find an abandoned InGen compound. A raptor chases them and summons the rest of its pack. The humans flee into a herd of <i><a href="/wiki/Corythosaurus" title="Corythosaurus">Corythosaurus</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Parasaurolophus" title="Parasaurolophus">Parasaurolophus</a></i>, causing a stampede, and separating Grant and Udesky from the others. Raptors attack Udesky in an attempt to lure the others out of a tree. The raptors almost kill Amanda when she tries to descend to help Udesky. The raptors' trap fails and they kill Udesky before departing.
</p><p>Elsewhere, Grant watches the raptors communicating and suspects they are searching for something. They corner him but is rescued by Eric, who survives in an overturned water truck. The next day, Grant and Eric hear Paul's satellite telephone ringing, and are reunited with Billy and the Kirbys. The group is then chased by the <i>Spinosaurus</i> that killed Nash.
</p><p>After the group escapes, Grant discovers Billy has taken two raptor eggs to use for funding, which provoked the raptor attacks. Grant decides to keep the eggs to ensure the group's survival. The group unknowingly enters a large aviary used to house <i><a href="/wiki/Pteranodon" title="Pteranodon">Pteranodons</a></i>, which attack the group and fly away with Eric. Billy rescues Eric using Ben's parasail, but is then attacked and apparently killed by the <i>Pteranodons</i>. The rest of the group escapes the aviary, leaving the door unlocked. They find a boat and make their way down a river.
</p><p>That night, the group retrieves the ringing telephone, which is buried in the feces of the <i>Spinosaurus</i>. Grant tries to contact Sattler but the <i>Spinosaurus</i> attacks the boat. Grant ignites the boat's fuel and burns the <i>Spinosaurus</i>, causing it to flee. The next day, the group makes its way towards the coast but are surrounded by the raptors. They surrender the eggs to the raptors while Grant uses the replica raptor larynx to confuse the pack, which runs off with the eggs.
</p><p>The group reach the coast and find that Sattler had called in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Marine_Corps" title="United States Marine Corps">U.S. Marine Corps</a> and the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy" title="United States Navy">U.S. Navy</a> to rescue them. They discover that Billy, while seriously injured, is still alive and has also been rescued. As they leave the island, they see the <i>Pteranodons</i> flying free.

Cat burglar <a href="/wiki/Catwoman" title="Catwoman">Selina Kyle</a> obtains Wayne's prints from <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Manor" title="Wayne Manor">Wayne Manor</a> for Daggett, but she is double-crossed at the exchange, and alerts the police. Gordon and the police arrive and pursue Bane and Daggett's henchmen into the sewers while Selina flees. The men capture Gordon and take him to Bane. Gordon escapes and is found by rookie officer <a href="/wiki/Robin_in_other_media#The_Dark_Knight_Rises" title="Robin in other media">John Blake</a>. Blake, a fellow orphan, confronts Bruce and convinces him to return as Batman. Bane later attacks the Gotham Stock Exchange by using Wayne's fingerprints in a series of transactions that leaves Wayne bankrupt; Batman resurfaces for the first time in eight years while intercepting Bane and his subordinates. Wayne's butler, <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred Pennyworth</a> resigns in an attempt to save Bruce from death at the hands of Bane. Wayne finds comfort in new Wayne Enterprises CEO Miranda Tate. Using the stolen transactions, Bane expands his operations and kills Daggett.
</p><p>Kyle agrees to take Batman to Bane but instead leads him into Bane's trap. Bane reveals that he intends to fulfill <a href="/wiki/Ra%27s_al_Ghul" title="Ra's al Ghul">Ra's al Ghul's</a> mission to destroy Gotham. Bane fights Batman and defeats him; dealing a crippling blow to his back before taking him abroad to an underground prison. There, the inmates tell Wayne the story of Ra's al Ghul's child, who was born and raised in the prison before finally escaping — the only prisoner to have done so. Bane lures Gotham's police into the underground sewer network and uses explosives to trap them, and destroy the bridges surrounding the city. He kills Mayor Anthony Garcia and forces Dr. Pavel to convert the reactor core into a decaying <a href="/wiki/Neutron_bomb" title="Neutron bomb">neutron bomb</a> at a football stadium before killing him as well. Bane reads Gordon's speech to the public, and releases the prisoners of <a href="/wiki/Blackgate_Penitentiary" title="Blackgate Penitentiary">Blackgate Penitentiary</a>, initiating chaos while holding the city hostage and isolated with the bomb.
</p><p>Months later, a recovered Wayne escapes from the prison and returns to Gotham.

Tate intervenes and stabs Batman, revealing herself to be <a href="/wiki/Talia_al_Ghul" title="Talia al Ghul">Talia al Ghul</a>, Ra's al Ghul's daughter. She activates the bomb's detonator, but Gordon blocks her signal. Talia leaves to find the bomb while Bane prepares to kill Batman, but Kyle arrives and kills Bane. Batman and Kyle pursue Talia, hoping to bring the bomb back to the reactor chamber where it can be stabilized. Talia's truck crashes, but she remotely floods and destroys the reactor chamber before dying. With no way to stop the detonation, Batman uses the <a href="/wiki/Batplane" title="Batplane">Batplane</a> to haul the bomb far over the bay, where it safely explodes. Before takeoff, Batman reveals his identity to Gordon.
</p><p>In the aftermath, Batman is presumed dead and is honored as a hero. With Wayne presumed dead as well, Wayne Manor becomes an orphanage and his remaining estate is left to Alfred. Gordon finds the previously destroyed Bat Signal repaired, while Lucius Fox discovers that Wayne had fixed the previously malfunctioning auto-pilot on the Batplane. Blake resigns from the police force and a parcel left to him in Wayne's will leads him to find the <a href="/wiki/Batcave" title="Batcave">Batcave</a>. While visiting <a href="/wiki/Florence" title="Florence">Florence</a>, Alfred discovers that Wayne is alive, and in a relationship with Kyle.
</p><p>A gang of criminals rob a <a href="/wiki/Gotham_City" title="Gotham City">Gotham City</a> mob bank, murdering each other for a higher share of the money until only the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Joker_(The_Dark_Knight)" title="The Joker (The Dark Knight)">Joker</a> remains, who escapes with the money. <a href="/wiki/Batman" title="Batman">Batman</a>, District Attorney <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Harvey_Dent" title="Harvey Dent">Harvey Dent</a> and Lieutenant <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jim_Gordon_(comics)" title="Jim Gordon (comics)">Jim Gordon</a> form an alliance to rid Gotham City of <a href="/wiki/Organized_crime" title="Organized crime">organized crime</a>. Bruce Wayne believes that with Dent as Gotham's protector, he can retire from being Batman and lead a normal life with <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Dawes" title="Rachel Dawes">Rachel Dawes</a> – even though she and Dent are dating.

The Joker interrupts the meeting to warn them that Batman is unhindered by the law, and offers to kill him in exchange for half of their money. The mob bosses disagree, and Gambol places a bounty on the Joker. The Joker finds and kills Gambol, taking over his gang. The mob decides to take the Joker up on his offer.
</p><p>Batman finds Lau in Hong Kong and brings him back to Gotham to testify, allowing Dent to apprehend the entire mob. The Joker threatens to kill people unless Batman reveals his identity, and starts by murdering Police Commissioner <a href="/wiki/Gillian_B._Loeb" title="Gillian B. Loeb">Gillian B. Loeb</a> and the judge presiding over the mob trial. The Joker also tries to kill Mayor Anthony Garcia, but Gordon sacrifices himself to stop the assassination. Dent kidnaps one of Joker’s henchmen and threatens him with a seemingly deadly game of heads or tails using Dent's lucky coin; in fact, Dent's coin has heads on both sides. Dent learns that Rachel is Joker's next target.
</p><p>Bruce decides to reveal his secret identity to prevent more deaths. Before he can, however, Dent falsely announces that <i>he</i> is Batman. Dent is taken into protective custody, but the Joker appears and attacks the convoy. Batman comes to Dent's rescue and Gordon, who faked his death, apprehends the Joker, securing a promotion to Commissioner. Rachel and Dent are escorted away by detectives on Maroni's payroll; Gordon later learns that they never arrived home. Batman interrogates the Joker, who reveals that they have been trapped in separate locations rigged with explosives and that Batman must choose one to save. Batman races to save Rachel, while Gordon attempts to rescue Dent. Batman arrives at the building, but realizes that the Joker has sent him to Dent's location instead. Both buildings explode, killing Rachel and disfiguring Dent. The Joker escapes with Lau, who leads him to the Mob's funds. The Joker burns the money and kills Lau and the Chechen.
</p><p>Coleman Reese, an accountant at <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Enterprises" title="Wayne Enterprises">Wayne Enterprises</a>, deduces that Bruce is Batman and threatens to publicize the information. Not wanting Reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the Joker threatens to destroy a hospital unless Reese is killed within an hour. All hospitals are evacuated and Gordon travels to secure Reese. The Joker, disguised as a hospital nurse, discovers Dent's ward and hands him a gun, convincing him to seek revenge for Rachel's death. The Joker destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. Dent goes on a killing spree, deciding the fates of people he holds responsible for Rachel's death by flipping his lucky coin, one face of which was corroded in the explosion. Dent eventually apprehends Gordon's family, believing Gordon's love for his family parallels his love for Rachel.
</p><p>After announcing that Gotham City will be subject to his rule by nightfall, the Joker rigs two evacuating ferries with explosives; one carrying civilians and the other prisoners. The passengers have been supplied with a trigger to the other boat's explosives, and the Joker announces through an intercom that he will blow both ferries if one of them has not been destroyed by midnight. Batman finds the Joker by using a sonar device that spies on the entire city, with the reluctant help of <a href="/wiki/Lucius_Fox" title="Lucius Fox">Lucius Fox</a>. The civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while Batman apprehends the Joker after a fight. Before the police arrive to take the Joker into custody, he gloats that Gotham's citizens will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes public knowledge.
</p><p>Gordon and Batman arrive at the building where Rachel died and find Dent threatening to kill Gordon's family. Dent again flips his coin and shoots Batman, spares himself, and aims to kill Gordon's son, claiming that Gordon's negligence is responsible for Rachel's death. Batman, who was wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the building to his death. Batman persuades Gordon to let him take responsibility for the killing spree to preserve Dent's heroic image. As the police launch a manhunt for Batman, Gordon destroys the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Bat-signal" title="Bat-signal">Bat-signal</a>, Fox watches as the sonar device self-destructs, and <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred</a> burns a letter from Rachel saying she plans to marry Dent.
</p><p>As a child, <a href="/wiki/Batman#Bruce_Wayne" title="Batman">Bruce Wayne</a> falls down into a dry well and is attacked by a swarm of bats, subsequently developing <a href="/wiki/List_of_phobias#C" title="List of phobias">chiroptophobia</a> (fear of bats). While watching an opera with his parents, <a href="/wiki/Thomas_Wayne" title="Thomas Wayne">Thomas</a> and <a href="/wiki/Martha_Wayne" title="Martha Wayne">Martha</a>, Bruce becomes frightened by performers masquerading as bats and asks to leave. Outside, mugger <a href="/wiki/Joe_Chill" title="Joe Chill">Joe Chill</a> murders Bruce's parents in front of him.

Bruce intends to murder Chill, but one of Falcone's assassins does so first. Bruce's childhood friend, law school student <a href="/wiki/Rachel_Dawes" title="Rachel Dawes">Rachel Dawes</a>, berates him for attempting to undermine the justice system, saying that his father would be ashamed. Bruce confronts Falcone, who tells him that real power comes from being feared.

After completing his training and purging his fears, Bruce learns the League intends to destroy Gotham, believing it to be corrupt, decadent, hypocritical and beyond saving; they intend Bruce to lead them after his final test of taking the life of a criminal. Bruce rejects both the League's cause and its edict that killing is necessary, burning down their temple during his escape. Ra's is killed by falling debris, while Bruce saves the unconscious Ducard.
</p><p>Bruce returns to Gotham intent on fighting crime. He takes an interest in his family's company, <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Enterprises" title="Wayne Enterprises">Wayne Enterprises</a>, which is being taken public by the unscrupulous William Earle.

In prison, Falcone meets <a href="/wiki/Scarecrow_(DC_Comics)" title="Scarecrow (DC Comics)">Dr. Jonathan Crane</a>, a corrupt psychologist whom he has helped smuggle drugs into Gotham, and threatens to reveal his complicity if Crane does not declare him mentally unfit for trial. Crane puts on a scarecrow mask and sprays Falcone with a <a href="/wiki/Scarecrow_(DC_Comics)#Fear_gas" title="Scarecrow (DC Comics)">fear-inducing hallucinogen</a> that drives him insane (which causes Falcone to constantly mouth the word "Scarecrow"), and has him transferred to <a href="/wiki/Arkham_Asylum" title="Arkham Asylum">Arkham Asylum</a>. While investigating "the Scarecrow", Batman is exposed to the hallucinogen and left incapacitated. He is saved by Alfred and given an antidote developed by Fox. When Rachel (now the city's assistant district attorney) accuses Crane of corruption, Crane reveals that he has been pouring his fear-inducing drug into Gotham's water supply. He drugs Rachel with it, but Batman subdues and interrogates Crane, who claims to work for Ra's al Ghul. Batman evades the police to get Rachel to safety, administers her the antidote, and gives her a vial of it for Gordon and another for mass production. Ducard reappears at Bruce's birthday party and reveals himself to be the true Ra's al Ghul. Having stolen a powerful microwave emitter from Wayne Enterprises, he plans to vaporize Gotham's water supply, rendering Crane's drug airborne and causing mass hysteria that will destroy the city. He sets Wayne Manor aflame and leaves Bruce to die, but Alfred rescues him.
</p><p>Ra's loads the microwave emitter onto Gotham's <a href="/wiki/Monorail" title="Monorail">monorail</a> system, intending to release the drug as the train travels toward the city's central water source. Batman rescues Rachel from a drugged mob and indirectly reveals his identity to her. He pursues Ra's onto the monorail and fights him as Gordon uses the Tumbler's cannons to destroy a section of the track. Batman refuses to kill Ra's, but also chooses not to save him, gliding from the train and leaving Ra's aboard as it crashes and explodes, killing him.
</p><p>Bruce gains Rachel's respect and love, but she decides she cannot be with him now, telling him that someday, if Gotham no longer needs Batman, they can be together. Batman becomes a public hero and Bruce reveals he has secretly purchased a controlling stake in Wayne Enterprises, firing Earle and replacing him with Fox.

Meanwhile, reporter Alexander Knox and photojournalist <a href="/wiki/Vicki_Vale" title="Vicki Vale">Vicki Vale</a> begin to investigate rumors of a vigilante nicknamed "<a href="/wiki/Batman" title="Batman">Batman</a>" who is targeting the city's criminals.
</p><p>Batman's <a href="/wiki/Alter_ego" title="Alter ego">alter-ego</a> is Bruce Wayne, a billionaire industrialist who, as a child, witnessed his parents' murder at the hands of a psychotic mugger. At a fundraiser for the bicentennial in Wayne Manor, Bruce meets and falls for Vale, and the two begin a romantic relationship. However, the evening is cut short as Bruce is alerted to Commissioner Gordon's sudden departure due to police business and leaves to investigate as Batman.
</p><p>Mob boss Carl Grissom, who has already been targeted by Dent and Gordon, discovers his mistress Alicia is involved with his second-in-command Jack Napier. With the help of corrupt police lieutenant Max Eckhardt, Grissom engineers Napier's death in a raid at <a href="/wiki/Ace_Chemicals" title="Ace Chemicals">Axis Chemicals</a>. However, Grissom's plan is foiled with the sudden arrival of Commissioner Gordon, who wants Napier captured alive. In the ensuing shootout, Napier, who has realized he was set up, kills Eckhardt. Batman arrives and, in a struggle, Napier is knocked into a vat of chemicals. Batman escapes and Napier is presumed dead.
</p><p>Napier emerges from the vat, but is left disfigured with chalk white skin, emerald green hair, and a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rictus_grin" title="Rictus grin">rictus grin</a>. The sociopathic Napier is driven insane by the incident and begins calling himself <a href="/wiki/Joker_(character)" title="Joker (character)">"the Joker"</a>. He kills Grissom and usurps authority over his criminal empire, and scars Alicia's face to equal his disfigurement.
</p><p>The Joker terrorizes Gotham City by lacing hygiene products with "Smylex", a deadly chemical which causes victims to <a href="/wiki/Death_from_laughter" title="Death from laughter">die laughing</a> with the same maniacal grin as the Joker. As he searches for information on Batman (whom he blames for his disfigurement), the Joker also becomes obsessed with Vale. He lures her to the Gotham Museum of Art and his henchmen <a href="/wiki/Vandalism" title="Vandalism">destroy the works of art</a>. Batman arrives and rescues her. They escape in the <a href="/wiki/Batmobile" title="Batmobile">Batmobile</a>, pursued by the Joker's men. Batman takes Vicki to the <a href="/wiki/Batcave" title="Batcave">Batcave</a>, where he gives her information from his research on Smylex that will allow the city's residents to avoid exposure to the toxin.
</p><p>Bruce visits Vicki at her apartment, prepared to tell her about his alter-ego. The Joker interrupts their meeting, asking Bruce, "You ever danced with the devil by the pale moonlight?" before shooting him. Bruce uses a bended serving tray as body armor and plays dead. He remembers that the mugger who killed his parents asked the same question, and realizes that Napier was his parents' killer. Vicki is brought to the Batcave by Bruce's butler, <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred Pennyworth</a>, who has been coaxing their relationship because Vicki brings out Bruce's human side. After telling her that he cannot focus on their relationship with the Joker terrorizing Gotham, Bruce departs as Batman to destroy the Axis plant. Meanwhile, the Joker lures the citizens of Gotham to a parade with the promise of free money, but while throwing cash at the crowd as promised, also attacks them with Smylex gas released from his giant parade balloons. Batman arrives and tows the balloons above the clouds with the <a href="/wiki/Batplane" title="Batplane">Batwing</a>. The Joker shoots the Batwing using a long-barreled gun, causing it to crash, and takes Vicki to the top of a cathedral.
</p><p>Batman, who survived the crash, fends off the Joker's remaining men despite his injuries, and confronts the Joker. The two fight, with Joker eventually gaining the upper hand, leaving Batman and Vicki clinging onto an outcropping. The Joker tries to escape by helicopter, but Batman attaches a heavy granite <a href="/wiki/Gargoyle" title="Gargoyle">gargoyle</a> to the Joker's leg with his grappling hook, causing him to lose his grip and fall to his death after it breaks off.
</p><p>Commissioner Gordon announces that the police have arrested the Joker's men and unveils the <a href="/wiki/Bat-Signal" title="Bat-Signal">Bat-Signal</a>.

She responds that she is not surprised, as Batman looks at the signal's projection from a rooftop, standing watch over the city.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Gotham_City" title="Gotham City">Gotham City</a>, the crime fighter <a href="/wiki/Batman" title="Batman">Batman</a> defuses a hostage situation caused by a criminal known as <a href="/wiki/Two-Face" title="Two-Face">Two-Face</a>, the alter ego of the former <a href="/wiki/District_attorney" title="District attorney">district attorney</a> Harvey Dent, but Two-Face escapes and remains at large. Edward Nygma, a researcher at <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Enterprises" title="Wayne Enterprises">Wayne Enterprises</a> who idolizes Bruce Wayne, has developed a device that can beam television into a person's brain. Bruce offers to let Nygma come up with schematics for the device and set up a meeting with his assistant. However, after Nygma demands an answer from him immediately, Bruce rejects the invention, believing it to be too close to mind manipulation. After killing his supervisor and staging it as a <a href="/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">suicide</a>, Nygma resigns and begins sending Bruce riddles, seeking retaliation against him.
</p><p>Bruce meets Chase Meridian, a psychiatrist who is obsessed with Batman, and invites her to come with him to a circus event. After a performance from the circus performers, The Flying Graysons, Two-Face arrives and threatens to blow up the circus unless Batman comes forward and surrenders his life to him. The Flying Graysons attempt to stop Two-Face, but most of them get killed as a result. Only Dick Grayson, the youngest member, survives as he climbs to the roof and throws Two-Face's bomb into a river.
</p><p>Bruce invites the orphaned Dick to stay at <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Manor" title="Wayne Manor">Wayne Manor</a>. Dick, still troubled by the murder of his family, intends to kill Two-Face and avenge his family. When he discovers that Bruce is Batman, he demands that Bruce help him find Two-Face so that he can kill him, but Bruce refuses. Meanwhile, Nygma, inspired and delighted by watching Two-Face's raid at the circus, turns himself into a criminal called the <a href="/wiki/Riddler" title="Riddler">Riddler</a> and forms an alliance with Two-Face. The two steal capital in order to mass-produce Nygma's brainwave device so that Riddler can use it to steal all of Gotham's confidential information, promising Two-Face Batman's secret identity in return. Nygma founds his own company, Nygmatech.
</p><p>At Nygma's business party, Nygma discovers Bruce's alter ego using the brainwave device. Two-Face arrives and crashes the party. He nearly kills Batman, but Dick manages to save him. Meanwhile, Chase has fallen in love with Bruce, which surpasses her obsession with Batman. Bruce decides to stop being Batman in order to have a normal life with Chase, and to prevent Dick from murdering Two-Face. Dick runs away while Bruce and Chase have dinner together in the manor, where Bruce reveals his secret identity to her. The Riddler and Two-Face arrive and attack Wayne Manor; in the process, the Riddler blows up the <a href="/wiki/Batcave" title="Batcave">Batcave</a>. The criminals kidnap Chase after Two-Face shoots Bruce, and the Riddler leaves him another riddle.
</p><p>Using the riddles, Bruce and his butler, <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred</a>, deduce the Riddler's secret identity. Chase is imprisoned by the Riddler and Two-Face in their hideout. Bruce puts on a new Batman costume. Dick returns and becomes Batman's sidekick, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Robin_(comics)" title="Robin (comics)">Robin</a>. Batman and Robin head to Riddler and Two-Face's lair, Claw Island, where they are separated. Robin encounters Two-Face and nearly kills him, but chooses to spare his life and is captured. The Riddler, revealing Chase and Robin bound and gagged with duct tape in containment tubes, gives Batman a chance to save only one hostage, but Batman destroys the Riddler's brainwave collecting device with a Batarang, causing the Riddler to suffer a mental breakdown and allowing Batman to rescue Robin and Chase. Two-Face corners the trio and determines their fate with the flip of a coin, but Batman throws a handful of identical coins in the air, causing Two-Face to stumble and fall to his death, as Robin watches.
</p><p>The Riddler is taken to <a href="/wiki/Arkham_Asylum" title="Arkham Asylum">Arkham Asylum</a> and imprisoned, but he claims he knows who Batman is. Chase is asked to consult on the case, but Nygma says that <i>he</i> himself is Batman, due to his damaged memories. Chase meets Bruce outside and tells him that his secret is safe before parting ways. Bruce resumes his crusade as Batman with Robin as his partner to protect Gotham from crime.
</p><p>In the prologue, socialites Tucker and Esther Cobblepot give birth to a deformed baby boy, Oswald. Disgusted by his appearance and wild demeanor, they confine the baby to a cage and ultimately throw him into the sewer, where he is discovered by a family of penguins at Gotham Zoo.
</p><p>Thirty-three years later, millionaire Max Shreck proposes to build a power plant to supply Gotham City with energy, though he is opposed by the city mayor. During Shreck's speech, Gotham is attacked by a disgraced former circus troupe, the Red Triangle Gang. Despite the efforts of Batman to stop the violence, Shreck is abducted and taken to the sewer, where he meets Oswald Cobblepot, the gang's secret leader now known as the Penguin. The Penguin blackmails Shreck with evidence of his corporate crimes into helping him return to the surface, and he accepts. Meanwhile, Shreck's secretary, Selina Kyle, discovers the true purpose of Shreck's power plant to drain Gotham of its energy and bring the city under Shreck's control. Shreck pushes her out of a window to silence her, but she survives the fall and vows revenge, taking up the mantle of Catwoman.
</p><p>The Penguin makes his presence known by "rescuing" the Mayor's baby from a staged kidnapping attempt, and requests to be allowed into the Hall of Records to find his parents. Batman's alter-ego, Bruce Wayne, voices his suspicions about the Penguin's true motives, and investigates his background and connection to the Red Triangle Gang. During a meeting with Shreck, Wayne meets Kyle and the two become attracted to one another. In order to remove his enemies, Shreck pushes for the Penguin to run for mayor and discredit the current mayor by having the Red Triangle Gang wreak havoc on the city. Batman intervenes and meets Catwoman as she attempts to sabotage one of Shreck's businesses; she escapes, but is injured and swears revenge on Batman by allying with the Penguin to frame him for an undiscussed crime.
</p><p>As Wayne and Kyle begin a romantic relationship, the Penguin abducts Gotham's Ice Princess and kills her, framing Batman for the act, at the same time sabotaging his Batmobile to rampage throughout Gotham (until Batman disconnects the controlling device), and ends his partnership with Catwoman, who didn't anticipate the murder, when she rejects his advances; he attempts to kill her with one of his flying umbrellas, but she survives after falling into a greenhouse. During the chase, Batman records the Penguin's disparaging remarks about the people of Gotham and later plays them during his next speech, destroying his image and forcing him to retreat to the sewer, where he reveals his plan to abduct and kill all of Gotham's firstborn sons as revenge for what his parents did to him. At a charity ball hosted by Shreck, Wayne and Kyle meet and discover each other's secret identities. The Penguin appears and reveals his plan, intending to take Shreck's son, Chip, with him, but Shreck gives himself up in his son's stead.
</p><p>Batman foils the kidnappings and heads for the Penguin's lair. The Penguin attempts to have his army of penguins bomb the city and kill everyone in Gotham, though Batman and his butler, Alfred, jam the signal and order the penguins to head back to the sewer. Batman arrives and confronts the Penguin. In the ensuing fight, the Penguin falls through a window into the sewer's toxic water. Shreck escapes but is confronted by Catwoman, who intends to kill him. Batman pleads for Kyle to stop, unmasking himself in the process. Shreck draws a gun and shoots Wayne, and then shoots Kyle multiple times, but she survives and electrocutes herself and Shreck with a stun gun. Wayne, who was wearing body armour, finds Shreck's corpse but Kyle is nowhere to be found. The Penguin emerges from the water, but eventually dies from his injuries and from the toxic sewage, and his penguin family lay his body to rest in the water. In the aftermath, as Alfred drives him home, Wayne sees Kyle's silhouette in an alley but only finds her cat, who he decides to take home with him. The Bat-Signal appears in the sky as Catwoman, who survived, watches.

</p><p>Artist and graphics designer Patience Phillips is a meek people-pleaser whose main support is her best friend Sally. She works for a <a href="/wiki/Cosmetics" title="Cosmetics">cosmetics</a> company called Hedare Beauty which is ready to ship a new skin cream called Beau-line that is able to reverse the effects of aging. However, when Patience visits the <a href="/wiki/Research_and_development" title="Research and development">R&amp;D</a> laboratory facility to deliver a redone ad design, she overhears a discussion between the scientist Dr. Ivan Slavicky and Laurel Hedare, the wife of company-owner George Hedare, about the dangerous <a href="/wiki/Side_effect" title="Side effect">side effects</a> from continued use of the product. Laurel's guards discover Patience and are ordered to dispose of her. Patience tries to escape using a conduit pipe, but the minions have it sealed and flush her out of it, drowning her. Washed up on shore, Patience is mysteriously revived by an <a href="/wiki/Egyptian_Mau" title="Egyptian Mau">Egyptian Mau</a> <a href="/wiki/Cat" title="Cat">cat</a> which had appeared at her apartment earlier; from that moment on, she develops cat-like abilities.
</p><p>From Mau's owner eccentric researcher Ophelia Powers, Patience learns that Egyptian Mau cats serve as messengers of the goddess <a href="/wiki/Bastet" title="Bastet">Bast</a>. Patience realizes that she is now a "catwoman," <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dying-and-rising_god" title="Dying-and-rising god">reborn</a> with abilities that are both a blessing and a curse. Disguised as a mysterious vigilante named <a href="/wiki/Catwoman" title="Catwoman">Catwoman</a> to hide her identity, Patience, under cover of darkness, searches for answers as to who killed her and why. Eventually, her search (which includes finding Slavicky's body, and later being accused of his murder) leads her to Laurel. She asks Laurel to keep an eye on George, to which Laurel agrees. However, when Patience confronts George (who is attending an opera with another woman) as Catwoman, he reveals he knows nothing about the side effects. The police, led by Patience's love interest Detective Tom Lone, arrive and Catwoman escapes. Later on, Laurel murders her husband for his infidelity and admits to having Dr. Slavicky killed because he wanted to cancel the product's release. She contacts Catwoman and frames her for the murder. Catwoman is then taken into custody by Tom, but not before Laurel reveals the side-effects of the product: discontinuing its use makes the skin disintegrate, while continuing its use makes the skin as hard as marble. She also plans to release Beau-line to the public the following day.
</p><p>Patience slips out of her cell and confronts Laurel in her office, rescuing Tom who came to question Laurel after second thoughts about Patience's guilt in the process and revealing that Laurel is the one responsible for her death. During the fight, she scratches Laurel's face multiple times, causing Laurel to fall out of a window and grab onto a pipe. Laurel sees her face in a window's reflection and horrified by her skin's rapid disintegration (as a result of the scratches and her own use of Beau-line for years), fails to grab hold of Patience's outstretched arm and falls to her death. Though Patience is cleared of any charges made against her regarding the deaths of Dr. Slavicky and the Hedares, she decides to end things with Tom by choosing to continue living outside the law and enjoying her newfound freedom as the mysterious Catwoman.

Wayne admits to <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred Pennyworth</a> that he plans to steal the kryptonite to weaponize it, should it become necessary to fight Superman.
</p><p>At a Congressional hearing, as Finch questions Superman on the validity of his actions, a bomb smuggled by Luthor goes off and kills everyone present but Superman. Believing he should have detected the bomb, and frustrated by his failure to save them, Superman goes into self-imposed exile. Batman breaks into LexCorp and steals the kryptonite. In preparation to battle Superman, he builds a <a href="/wiki/Powered_exoskeleton" title="Powered exoskeleton">powered exoskeleton</a>, creates a kryptonite <a href="/wiki/Grenade_launcher" title="Grenade launcher">grenade launcher</a>, and a kryptonite-tipped spear.

Luthor demands that Superman kill Batman in exchange for Martha's life. Superman tries to explain the situation to Batman, but instead Batman attacks Superman and eventually subdues him with the aid of a kryptonite gas. Before Batman can kill Superman with the spear, Superman urges Batman to "save Martha", whose name is also shared with Batman's mother, confusing him long enough for Lois to arrive and explain what Superman meant. Realizing how far he has fallen and unwilling to let an innocent die, Batman rescues Martha, while Superman confronts Luthor on the scout ship.

After impaling it with the spear, in the creature's last moments, it kills Superman, having been weakened himself by exposure to kryptonite.
</p><p>Luthor is arrested and Batman confronts him in prison, warning Luthor that he will always be watching him. Luthor gloats that Superman's death has made the world vulnerable to powerful alien threats. A memorial is held for Superman in Metropolis. Clark is also declared dead, with various friends and family members including Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince attending his funeral in <a href="/wiki/Smallville_(comics)" title="Smallville (comics)">Smallville</a>.

During his latest mission to stop the <a href="/wiki/Joker_(character)" title="Joker (character)">Joker</a> from destroying the city, he hurts his feelings by telling him he is not as important in his life as he thinks he is, leading Joker to seek the ultimate revenge on him. The following day, Batman's alter ego Bruce Wayne attends the city's winter gala which is celebrating both the retirement of <a href="/wiki/James_Gordon_(comics)" title="James Gordon (comics)">Commissioner Gordon</a> and the ascension of his daughter <a href="/wiki/Barbara_Gordon" title="Barbara Gordon">Barbara</a> as the city's new <a href="/wiki/Police_commissioner" title="Police commissioner">police commissioner</a>, only to be infuriated by Barbara's plans to restructure the police to function without the need of Batman.

</p><p>Suspecting his arch-rival is up to something, Batman plots to steal <a href="/wiki/Superman" title="Superman">Superman</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Phantom_Zone" title="Phantom Zone">Phantom Zone</a> Projector, a device that can banish anyone to the Phantom Zone which houses some of the most dangerous villains in the Lego multiverse.

Realizing that the city does need him, Barbara releases Batman and Robin and teams up with them and Alfred to stop the Joker. Although Batman finds himself able to trust and rely on his new team upon reaching <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Manor" title="Wayne Manor">Wayne Island</a>, he chooses to send them away rather than losing them like his parents. Upon facing him alone, Joker believes that Batman is incapable of change and zaps him to the Phantom Zone before stealing the <a href="/wiki/Batcave" title="Batcave">Batcave</a>'s stash of confiscated bombs. Arriving in the Phantom Zone, Batman witnesses the harm his selfishness has caused to everyone and slowly accepts his greatest fear. Making a deal with the Zone's gatekeeper Phyllis, a talking Lego brick, to be allowed back to Gotham in order to retrieve the Zone's escaped prisoners, Batman arrives in time to save his teammates, apologizing to them for his actions, and requesting their help to stop Joker.
</p><p>Realizing that Joker plans to use the explosives he took to destroy the city's Energy Facility, thus causing the city to come apart and be destroyed, Batman turns Barbara into <a href="/wiki/Batgirl" title="Batgirl">Batgirl</a>, before he, his team, and Gotham City's other villains, who felt neglected by Joker, manage to successfully send the escaped villains back to the Phantom Zone. However, the group fail to stop Joker's bombs going off as the explosion begins to tear the city apart at the plates beneath it. Knowing this was his fault, Batman reluctantly convinces Joker that he is the true reason for being the hero he is before they, their friends and allies, and the city's inhabitants, chain-link themselves together and pull the plates back together, saving the city.
</p><p>With the city saved, Batman prepares to be taken back into the Phantom Zone to fulfill his bargain only to be rejected by Phyllis who chooses to let him remain after seeing how much he had changed in order to save everyone. Afterwards, Batman allows Joker and the rest of his rogues to temporarily escape with the confidence that whenever they return, they will be no match for Batman and his family.
</p><p>A young Bruce Wayne meets <a href="/wiki/Andrea_Beaumont" title="Andrea Beaumont">Andrea Beaumont</a> while visiting his parents' grave, and they form a deep mutual attraction. That night, in one of his first crime-fighting attempts, Bruce foils an armored car robbery, but is discouraged because the criminals did not fear him. Eventually, Bruce decides to abandon his plans to become a <a href="/wiki/Vigilante" title="Vigilante">vigilante</a> and proposes marriage to Andrea. However, Andrea mysteriously leaves Gotham with her father, businessman Carl Beaumont, ending her engagement in a <a href="/wiki/Dear_John_letter" title="Dear John letter">"Dear John" letter</a>. Believing he has lost his last chance of having a normal life, Bruce becomes <a href="/wiki/Batman" title="Batman">Batman</a>.
</p><p>Ten years later in the present, Batman confronts a group of <a href="/wiki/Gotham_City" title="Gotham City">Gotham City</a> <a href="/wiki/Organized_crime" title="Organized crime">crime bosses</a> led by Chuckie Sol, who are intending to <a href="/wiki/Money_laundering" title="Money laundering">launder</a> millions of <a href="/wiki/Counterfeit_money" title="Counterfeit money">counterfeit dollars</a> in a casino. As Sol escapes to his car, a cloaked figure attacks him; Sol is killed when the figure causes him to drive out the side of a parking garage and crash into a neighboring building. Batman arrives soon after, and bystanders blame him for deliberately causing Sol's death. Councilman Arthur Reeves tells the media that Batman is a menace (despite <a href="/wiki/James_Gordon_(comics)" title="James Gordon (comics)">Commissioner Gordon</a>'s protests). Attending a party at Wayne Manor, Reeves teases Bruce for allowing Andrea to leave him.
</p><p>The cloaked figure murders another gangster, Buzz Bronski, in the same cemetery Bruce met Andrea. Batman investigates Bronski's death and wanders to his parents' tombstone. He finds Andrea talking at her mother's grave, just as she had been when he first met her. She is startled by Batman's appearance and he flees. Batman finds evidence linking Carl Beaumont with Sol, Bronski and a third gangster: Salvatore Valestra. He breaks into Valestra's home and discovers a photograph of Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont seated at a table. When he visits Andrea to try to get more answers she rebuffs him, intimating she now knows his identity. Meanwhile, Valestra, believing Batman killed the others and will come for him, turns to <a href="/wiki/Joker_(character)" title="Joker (character)">the Joker</a> for help.
</p><p>The figure arrives at Valestra's house but finds the gangster dead by Joker's hands. Joker has strapped a camera to Valestra's corpse and sees the murderer is not Batman. The figure escapes as the house explodes. Batman pursues and fights the killer, but is interrupted by the police and rescued from arrest by Andrea. Andrea later explains she and her father had been hiding in Europe from Valestra's mob, from whom he had <a href="/wiki/Embezzlement" title="Embezzlement">embezzled</a> money; her father repaid everything, but they put out a <a href="/wiki/Contract_killing" title="Contract killing">hit</a> for his death anyway. Bruce now believes that her father is the killer. Bruce ponders resuming his relationship with Andrea and giving up Batman. He notices a photo of Bronski, Valestra, Sol and Beaumont with Valestra's chauffeur in the background; Bruce realizes the chauffeur is actually the man who would become the Joker. Joker visits Reeves to press him for information about the killer; Reeves insists the killer is Batman, but Joker, believing Reeves is the killer, states Reeves needs to protect his own reputation and poisons him. Reeves is taken to the hospital where Batman later breaks in and interrogates him. Reeves confesses he had helped the Beaumonts escape, but later told Valestra's mob Carl's location when Carl declined to help fund his first election campaign, leading Batman to realize who the killer truly is.
</p><p>The cloaked figure tracks Joker to his hideout, where Joker reveals that he has also deduced that the killer is Andrea, intent on avenging her father's death by killing every last surviving member of Valestra's mob. With all the others dead, Joker is the last one alive, and is the one who carried out the hit on her father. Joker fights her, but just before he can kill Andrea, Batman arrives and begs Andrea to give up her quest. She refuses and disappears. Batman and the Joker battle to a stalemate. Moments later Andrea returns and seizes Joker, bidding Batman goodbye before vanishing with the maniacally laughing clown. The amusement park erupts in a series of explosions and Batman barely escapes. <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred</a> later consoles Bruce, telling him that no one could have helped Andrea. Bruce finds her locket, containing a picture of himself and Andrea, in the <a href="/wiki/Batcave" title="Batcave">Batcave</a>. Meanwhile, Andrea departs from Gotham alone on an ocean liner, feeling completely lost. Batman stands on top of a Gotham building when the <a href="/wiki/Bat-Signal" title="Bat-Signal">Bat-Signal</a> appears in the sky, and swings off into the night to continue his war on crime.

The art styles for the films are also generally more realistically proportionate. The majority of the films are rated PG-13 by the <a href="/wiki/Motion_Picture_Association_of_America" title="Motion Picture Association of America">MPAA</a> with the exception of <i><a href="/wiki/All-Star_Superman_(film)" title="All-Star Superman (film)">All-Star Superman</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Green_Lantern:_Emerald_Knights" title="Green Lantern: Emerald Knights">Green Lantern: Emerald Knights</a></i>, which are rated PG, and <i><a href="/wiki/Batman:_The_Killing_Joke_(film)" title="Batman: The Killing Joke (film)">Batman: The Killing Joke</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Justice_League_Dark_(film)" title="Justice League Dark (film)">Justice League Dark</a></i>, <i><a href="/wiki/Batman:_Gotham_by_Gaslight" title="Batman: Gotham by Gaslight">Batman: Gotham by Gaslight</a></i> and <i><a href="/wiki/Suicide_Squad:_Hell_to_Pay" title="Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay">Suicide Squad: Hell to Pay</a></i>, which are rated R.

Paris Franz, the robbers' leader and the nephew of a powerful mob boss, develops a dangerous obsession with her and starts sending her messages. After Franz tricks her into finding his uncle's dead body, Batman becomes concerned about her safety and takes her off the case, telling her that she will eventually be tempted to kill the criminals she pursues. Outraged, Batgirl attacks Batman physically and verbally, which leads to the both of them having sex. A few nights later, Batgirl tries to apologize to Batman, but he is ambushed by Franz and his men, prompting her to come to his aid. When she arrives and overpowers Franz, he makes her lose control and give him a savage beating, stopping just short of killing him. Realizing Batman was right, she retires from crime-fighting.
</p><p>Later, Batman investigates a murder scene with <a href="/wiki/Harvey_Bullock_(comics)" title="Harvey Bullock (comics)">Detective Harvey Bullock</a> and concludes that the Joker, currently held at <a href="/wiki/Arkham_Asylum" title="Arkham Asylum">Arkham Asylum</a>, might be behind the crime. He goes to Arkham to talk to him, only to discover that he has escaped and put a decoy in his place. Joker then attacks Barbara and her father, Commissioner James Gordon. He shoots her in the stomach, paralyzing her from the waist down, and takes Gordon to an abandoned amusement park. There, Joker strips him naked and subjects him to torture, including showing him photos he took of Barbara, naked and in pain.
</p><p>The story is intercut with flashbacks of Joker's origin. It is revealed that he was once a lab technician who quit his job to become a stand-up comedian, only to fail miserably. Desperate to support his pregnant wife Jeannie, he agrees to help two criminals rob his former workplace. The criminals tell him that he has to use the <a href="/wiki/Red_Hood#The_Joker" title="Red Hood">Red Hood</a>'s mask and caped costume, secretly intending to frame him. During the planning, the police inform him that Jeannie and their unborn child have died in a household accident. Grief-stricken, he tries to withdraw from the plan, but the criminals strong-arm him into keeping his commitment to them.
</p><p>At the plant, the criminals and the costumed comedian run into security personnel, and a shootout occurs. The criminals are gunned down and the comedian is confronted by Batman. Terrified, the comedian trips and falls into the chemical plant's waste pond, and is swept through a pipe leading to the outside. As he removes his mask, he sees the chemicals have permanently disfigured his face, giving him a clown-like appearance. His disfigurement, combined with the loss of his family, drives him insane and transforms him into the Joker.
</p><p>In the present, Batman finds and saves Gordon, while the Joker flees. Despite his ordeal, Gordon remains sane and demands that Batman capture the Joker "by the book". Batman follows the Joker as the latter tries to persuade him that the world is just one big joke, and that "one bad day" is enough to drive an ordinary man insane. Batman subdues Joker, tells him that Gordon has remained sane, and concludes that Joker is alone in his madness. He then attempts to reach out to him, offering rehabilitation. Joker declines, saying it is too late. He then says that the situation reminds him of a joke about two patients in an insane asylum who try to escape by leaping over to the adjoining building. The first patient makes it across, but the second patient is too afraid. The first patient says, "Hey, I got this flashlight with me. I'll shine it across the gap between the buildings and you can walk across the beam and join me." But the second patient says, "What do you think I am, crazy? You'll just turn it off when I'm halfway across!" Batman and Joker then have a good laugh at the joke as the police arrive. The Joker's laugh trails off while Batman continues to laugh, leaving the ending as ambiguous as the comic.

Swamp Thing appears, informing Woodrue that he would threaten the Green with his concoction; however, he will not interfere. Batman and Nightwing wonder how to stop Woodrue, until Harley points out he is a plant and asks if they have a match. Grateful, they both give her a kiss on the cheek and just set Woodrue on fire.

Batman and Robin head back to Commissioner Gordon's office, where they deduce that the tip was a set-up by the United Underworld, a gathering of four of the most powerful villains in <a href="/wiki/Gotham_City" title="Gotham City">Gotham City</a>: <a href="/wiki/Joker_(character)" title="Joker (character)">The Joker</a>, <a href="/wiki/Penguin_(character)" title="Penguin (character)">The Penguin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Riddler" title="Riddler">The Riddler</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Catwoman" title="Catwoman">Catwoman</a>.
</p><p>The United Underworld equip themselves with a dehydrator that can turn humans into dust (an invention of Schmidlapp, who is unaware that he has been kidnapped), a submarine made to resemble a <a href="/wiki/Penguin" title="Penguin">penguin</a>, and their three pirate henchmen (Bluebeard, Morgan and Quetch). It is revealed the yacht was really a projection. When Batman and Robin return to a buoy concealing a projector, they are trapped on the buoy by a magnet and targeted by torpedoes. They use a radio-detonator to destroy two of the missiles, and a porpoise sacrifices itself to intercept the last one. Catwoman, disguised as <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet</a> journalist "Kitayna Ireyna Tatanya Kerenska Alisoff" (acronymed as Kitka), helps the group kidnap Bruce Wayne and pretends to be kidnapped with him, as part of a plot to lure Batman and finish him off with another of the Penguin's explosive animals (not knowing that Bruce Wayne is Batman's alter-ego). After Bruce Wayne escapes captivity, the Penguin disguises himself as the Commodore and schemes his way into the <a href="/wiki/Batcave" title="Batcave">Batcave</a> along with five dehydrated henchmen. This plan fails when the henchmen unexpectedly disappear into <a href="/wiki/Antimatter" title="Antimatter">antimatter</a> once struck: The Penguin mistakenly rehydrated them with <a href="/wiki/Heavy_water" title="Heavy water">heavy water</a>, used to recharge the Batcave's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Atomic_pile" title="Atomic pile">atomic pile</a>.
</p><p>Ultimately, Batman and Robin are unable to prevent the kidnapping of the dehydrated United World Organization's Security Council. Giving chase in the <a href="/wiki/Batboat" title="Batboat">batboat</a> to retrieve them (and Miss Kitka, presumed by the duo as still captive), Robin uses a sonic charge weapon to disable The Penguin's submarine and force it to surface, where a fist fight ensues. Although Batman and Robin win the fight, Batman is heartbroken to find out that his "true love" Miss Kitka is actually Catwoman when her mask falls off. Commodore Schmidlapp accidentally breaks the vials containing the powdered Council members, mixing them together.
</p><p>Batman sets to work, constructing an elaborate filter to separate the mingled dust. Robin asks him whether it might be in the world's best interests for them to alter the dust samples, so that humans can no longer harm one another. In response, Batman says that they cannot do so, reminding Robin of the fate of the Penguin's henchmen and their tainted rehydration, and can only hope for people in general to learn to live together peacefully on their own.
</p><p>With the world watching, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Security_Council" title="Security Council">Security Council</a> is re-hydrated. All of the members are restored alive and well, but continue to squabble amongst themselves, totally oblivious of their surroundings, but each of them now speaks the language and displays the stereotypical mannerisms of a nation other than their own. Batman quietly expresses his sincere hope to Robin that this "mixing of minds" does more good than it does harm. The duo quietly leave <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_Nations_Headquarters" title="United Nations Headquarters">United World Headquarters</a> by climbing out of the window and descending on their batropes.
</p><p>At stately <a href="/wiki/Wayne_Manor" title="Wayne Manor">Wayne Manor</a>, <a href="/wiki/Batman" title="Batman">Bruce Wayne</a> and his ward <a href="/wiki/Dick_Grayson" title="Dick Grayson">Dick Grayson</a> watch their favorite show, <i>Gotham Palace</i>. During the programming, a band that was supposed to play on the show is revealed to be hidden and replaced by four of the Dynamic Duo's greatest villains; <a href="/wiki/Joker_(character)" title="Joker (character)">the Joker</a>, <a href="/wiki/Penguin_(character)" title="Penguin (character)">the Penguin</a>, <a href="/wiki/Riddler" title="Riddler">the Riddler</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Catwoman" title="Catwoman">Catwoman</a>. Bruce and Dick suit up as Batman and Robin and head towards the Gotham City Police Department, where they receive a riddle from <a href="/wiki/James_Gordon_(comics)" title="James Gordon (comics)">Commissioner Gordon</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Batman_(TV_series)_characters#Chief_O.27Hara" title="List of Batman (TV series) characters">Chief O'Hara</a>.
</p><p>They discover that the crooks are robbing the Acme Atomic Energy Laboratory of the Replication Ray that was invented by Dr. Nichols. The Replication Ray has the power to make a perfect duplicate out of anything. After a brief fight, the criminals manage to escape Batman, but leave behind a clue that leads the caped crusaders to their lair in an abandoned TV dinner factory. While discussing what to do with the Replication Ray, Catwoman reveals her plan to make Batman join their side with a scratch from a substance called "Batnip". After Batman and Robin break in, they are defeated by the criminals and trapped on a frozen food tray heading towards a large oven. Catwoman uses her Batnip on Batman, but he is supposedly unaffected by it. The two escape the trap after the villains leave the factory.
</p><p>Back at stately Wayne Manor, Bruce starts showing signs of aggression after Aunt Harriet nearly discovers the Batcave. He blames <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred</a> for the incident and fires him, leaving the butler to wander on the streets homeless. After days of not finding Joker, Penguin, Riddler and Catwoman, Batman figures out that the four crooks are no longer on Earth and have hijacked a space station. The two heroes go into space with the help of their Bat-Rocket.
</p><p>At the space station, Joker, Penguin and Riddler betray Catwoman as they do not trust her to be on their side due to her feelings for Batman. They try to throw her out into space. She is rescued by the Dynamic Duo and aids them in defeating her former allies for revenge. Batman savagely beats the three men and recovers the Replication Ray, but Catwoman escapes in an escape pod in the process.
</p><p>After the mission, Dick expresses concern towards Bruce for his behavior in the space station and at the Gotham City Police Department (where he left when Gordon was not looking without a word). Bruce kicks Dick out of the house and takes a break from being Batman, resulting in a crime spree in Gotham City.
</p><p>A few weeks later, Batman returns to the Gotham City Police Department and blames the police for the increase in crime. He uses the Replication Ray on himself to replace Gordon and O'Hara as <a href="/wiki/Police_commissioner" title="Police commissioner">police commissioner</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chief_of_police" title="Chief of police">police chief</a> respectively.
</p><p>Batman soon replaces most of the government, jobs, and citizens in Gotham with his replicas and plans to take over the world. Dick realizes that the Batnip had a delayed effect on Batman and was slowly making him more evil over time. He then suits up as Robin and goes to Catwoman's lair to request her help in curing Batman which she agrees to do as she thinks the effects of the Batnip were more severe than she had planned.
</p><p>The two take the Catmobile to the Batcave, where Catwoman attempts to give Batman the antidote, but Batman anticipated it and took the Bat Anti-Antidote. Batman defeats the two in a fight and leaves them to die in the Nuclear Reactor, but they survive thanks to Robin's Bat Anti Isotope Spray. Knowing they cannot take on an army of Batmen by themselves, Robin and Catwoman arrange the prison break of most of Batman's rogues gallery from <a href="/wiki/Gotham_State_Penitentiary" title="Gotham State Penitentiary">Gotham State Penitentiary</a>; <a href="/wiki/List_of_Batman_(TV_series)_characters#Archer" title="List of Batman (TV series) characters">Archer</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Batman_(TV_series)_characters#Black_Widow" title="List of Batman (TV series) characters">Black Widow</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Batman_(TV_series)_characters#Bookworm" title="List of Batman (TV series) characters">Bookworm</a>, <a href="/wiki/Clock_King" title="Clock King">Clock King</a>, <a href="/wiki/Egghead_(DC_Comics)" title="Egghead (DC Comics)">Egghead</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Batman_(TV_series)_characters#False_Face" title="List of Batman (TV series) characters">False Face</a>, <a href="/wiki/King_Tut_(comics)" title="King Tut (comics)">King Tut</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Batman_(TV_series)_characters#Louie_the_Lilac" title="List of Batman (TV series) characters">Louie the Lilac</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mad_Hatter_(comics)" title="Mad Hatter (comics)">Mad Hatter</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Batman_(TV_series)_characters#Minstrel" title="List of Batman (TV series) characters">Minstrel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mr._Freeze" title="Mr. Freeze">Mr. Freeze</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Batman_(TV_series)_characters#Sandman" title="List of Batman (TV series) characters">Sandman</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Batman_(TV_series)_characters#Shame" title="List of Batman (TV series) characters">Shame</a> and <a href="/wiki/Siren_(DC_Comics)" title="Siren (DC Comics)">Siren</a> by claiming to <a href="/wiki/List_of_Batman_(TV_series)_characters#WardenCrichton" title="List of Batman (TV series) characters">Warden Crichton</a> that the ball and chains and pickaxes are not in good shape. This resulted in the replaced versions carrying the villains out of the prison. While a <a href="/wiki/Prison_officer" title="Prison officer">prison guard</a> tells Warden Crichton that Joker, Penguin and Riddler did not escape, the three of them mysteriously turn into a pile of dust.
</p><p>The two confront Batman and his army on the <i>Gotham Palace</i> set, but they still lose even with the help of the criminals. Before Batman kills Robin and Catwoman, a disguised Alfred arrives and gives Batman a strong enough antidote to counter the Bat Anti-Antidote. Batman returns to normal, and the rest of his clones turn to dust as the Replication Ray was not strong enough to make perfect clones.
</p><p>Batman realized that his behavior change was used as a distraction by Joker, Penguin and Riddler, and that the ones they arrested were fake copies. Joker had spiked the Batnip Catwoman was using. The real ones were using the opportunity to rob the Gotham Art Museum. Joker, Penguin and Riddler just wanted to get Batman out of the way first. Batman, Robin, and Catwoman (who came as vengeance for what they did at the space station) chase them to Penguin's blimp, where the villainous trio is defeated after they are knocked off the blimp to a safe location to be arrested. Catwoman tries to escape with the stolen paintings, but Batman recovers them. Unwilling to be put in a cage again, Catwoman allows herself to fall into a smokestack.
</p><p>Bruce and Dick then throw Aunt Harriet a surprise birthday party acting as if that is the secret they have been hiding from her. During the party, Bruce and Dick are called away by the Bat-Signal.
</p><p>In 1961, the <i>Ark</i>, a <a href="/wiki/Cybertron" title="Cybertron">Cybertronian</a> spacecraft carrying an invention capable of ending the war between the benevolent <a href="/wiki/Autobot" title="Autobot">Autobots</a> and the malevolent <a href="/wiki/Decepticon" title="Decepticon">Decepticons</a>, crash lands on the <a href="/wiki/Far_side_of_the_Moon" title="Far side of the Moon">dark side of Earth's Moon</a>.

In 1969, the crew of <a href="/wiki/Apollo_11" title="Apollo 11">Apollo 11</a> lands on the Moon.
</p><p>In the present, the Autobots assist the United States military in preventing major conflicts around the globe. During a mission to <a href="/wiki/Chernobyl" title="Chernobyl">Chernobyl</a> to investigate suspected alien technology, the Autobots are attacked by a giant Cybertronian worm-creature called the Driller and his master <a href="/wiki/Shockwave_(Transformers)" title="Shockwave (Transformers)">Shockwave</a>, a Decepticon scientist. After the two escape, <a href="/wiki/Optimus_Prime" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a> finds the technology is a fuel cell from the <i>Ark</i>, discovering it had survived its escape from Cybertron. After learning of the top-secret mission to the Moon, the Autobots travel there to explore the <i>Ark</i>. They discover a comatose <a href="/wiki/Sentinel_Prime" title="Sentinel Prime">Sentinel Prime</a>—Optimus's predecessor as leader of the Autobots—and five Pillars he created as a means of establishing a <a href="/wiki/Transformers_technology" title="Transformers technology">Space Bridge</a> between two points to teleport matter. After returning to Earth, Optimus uses the energy of his <a href="/wiki/Matrix_of_Leadership" title="Matrix of Leadership">Matrix of Leadership</a> to revive Sentinel Prime.
</p><p>Meanwhile, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_Transformers_film_series_characters" title="List of Transformers film series characters">Sam Witwicky</a> is frustrated that he is unable to work with the Autobots or find a job. He also becomes envious of the close relationship between his new girlfriend, <a href="/wiki/Carly_Witwicky" title="Carly Witwicky">Carly Spencer</a>, and her boss <a href="/wiki/List_of_Transformers_film_series_cast_and_characters" title="List of Transformers film series cast and characters">Dylan Gould</a>. After finding work, Sam is provided information by his eccentric co-worker Jerry Wang about the <i>Ark</i>, before Jerry is assassinated by the Decepticon <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Transformers_(TV_series)_characters" title="List of The Transformers (TV series) characters">Laserbeak</a>. Sam contacts the now independently wealthy Sector 7 Agent Seymour Simmons, and together they realize the Decepticons and their leader <a href="/wiki/Megatron" title="Megatron">Megatron</a> are murdering people connected to the American and Soviet space missions to the <i>Ark</i>. They locate two surviving cosmonauts, who reveal satellite photos of hundreds of Pillars being stockpiled on the Moon. Sam realizes that the Decepticons raided the <i>Ark</i> long before the Apollo 11 mission to the moon and intentionally left Sentinel and the five Pillars for the Autobots to find, as Sentinel is the key to activating the Pillars and the Decepticons lacked the means to revive him. The Autobots fight off three pursuing Decepticons: the Dreads, and rush to return Sentinel to their base for protection, but Sentinel betrays them and murders the Autobot <a href="/wiki/Ironhide" title="Ironhide">Ironhide</a>, revealing he had made a deal with Megatron to ensure Cybertron's survival.
</p><p>Sentinel uses the Pillars to transport hundreds of concealed Decepticons from the Moon to Earth. Carly is later captured by Dylan, who is revealed to be in service of the Decepticons. The Autobots are exiled from Earth at the demand of the Decepticons to avoid war, but as their ship leaves Earth it is destroyed by <a href="/wiki/Starscream" title="Starscream">Starscream</a>, seemingly killing the Autobots. The Decepticons, led by Megatron and Sentinel, invade <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a> as their agents place Pillars around the world. Dylan reveals to Carly that the Decepticons plan to transport their homeworld Cybertron to the Solar System, and then enslave humanity and use Earth's resources to rebuild their world. Sam teams up with former <a href="/wiki/United_States_Air_Force" title="United States Air Force">USAF</a> <a href="/wiki/Chief_master_sergeant" title="Chief master sergeant">Chief</a> Robert Epps and several ex-NEST soldiers to go into Chicago to save Carly and arrest Dylan, but they are nearly killed by Decepticon forces before the Autobots intervene, revealing they concealed themselves during the launch of their ship to convince the Decepticons they were destroyed.
</p><p>Working together, the Autobots, along with several ex-<a href="/wiki/United_States_Army_Rangers" title="United States Army Rangers">Rangers</a> and <a href="/wiki/United_States_Navy_SEALs" title="United States Navy SEALs">Navy SEALs</a>, manage to rescue Carly and kill Laserbeak, the Driller, Starscream, <a href="/wiki/Soundwave_(Transformers)" title="Soundwave (Transformers)">Soundwave</a>, and Shockwave, with Optimus using Shockwave's arm-cannon to blast the Control Pillar, disabling the Space Bridge. During the battle, the Autobot Wheeljack is killed while Wheelie and Brains sneak on board a Decepticon warship and sabotage it. Sam confronts Dylan as he reactivates the Control Pillar, and knocks Dylan into the Pillar, killing him. <a href="/wiki/Bumblebee_(Transformers)" title="Bumblebee (Transformers)">Bumblebee</a> and <a href="/wiki/Ratchet_(Transformers)" title="Ratchet (Transformers)">Ratchet</a> arrive and destroy the Control Pillar, permanently disabling the Bridge and causing the partially transported Cybertron to implode, becoming badly damaged. Optimus and Sentinel fight while Carly convinces Megatron that he will be replaced by Sentinel as leader of the Decepticons. Sentinel severs Optimus's right arm and is about to execute him until Megatron, having listened to Carly, intervenes, incapacitating Sentinel. Megatron slyly proposes a truce, having the desire to become the one in charge again, but Optimus instead attacks Megatron, decapitating and killing him. Sentinel pleads for his life, but Optimus executes him too for his betrayal. With the Decepticons defeated, Carly and Sam are reunited and the Autobots, knowing that Cybertron is badly damaged, remain on Earth still; making it their temporary home.
</p><p>Sixty-five million years ago, an alien race known as the “Creators” used devices called Seeds to terraform Planet Earth, covering it with an alloy called Transformium. In the present day, <a href="/wiki/Geologist" title="Geologist">geologist</a> Darcy Tyril excavates the Transformium for K.S.I. Industries, which uses it to build man-made Transformer drones.
</p><p>Five years after <a href="/wiki/Transformers:_Dark_of_the_Moon" title="Transformers: Dark of the Moon">the Battle of Chicago</a>, humans have begun to view the Transformers as a threat, leading the U.S. government to terminate all human-Autobot joint programs. Although the public believes the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Autobots" title="Autobots">Autobots</a> have been granted sanctuary, they are being hunted by a rogue <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/CIA" title="CIA">CIA</a> <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Black_ops" title="Black ops">black ops</a> division known as Cemetery Wind, led by opportunistic government official Harold Attinger, who believes all Transformers should be exterminated regardless of their faction. They are aided by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lockdown_(Transformers)" title="Lockdown (Transformers)">Lockdown</a>, a Cybertronian <a href="/wiki/Bounty_hunter" title="Bounty hunter">bounty hunter</a> working for the Creators, promising to give Attinger a Seed if his division manages to capture <a href="/wiki/Optimus_Prime" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a>. Cemetery Wind locates <a href="/wiki/Ratchet_(Transformers)" title="Ratchet (Transformers)">Ratchet</a> in <a href="/wiki/Mexico_City" title="Mexico City">Mexico City</a> and Lockdown kills him when he refuses to give up the whereabouts of Optimus Prime.
</p><p>Optimus, damaged in Mexico City and disguised as an old Marmon 97 semi-truck, is discovered in an abandoned theater by Cade Yeager, a financially struggling Texan inventor, and brings him back to his farm. While his teenage daughter Tessa and business partner Lucas Flannery encourage him to turn Optimus over to the authorities after realizing what he really is, Cade instead fixes Optimus, hoping to understand his technology and unexpectedly revives him. Still skeptical of Optimus, Lucas calls Cemetery Wind, who attacks and destroys the farm, but Optimus and Tessa's boyfriend, Irish <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Rally_car" title="Rally car">rally car</a> driver Shane Dyson, come to the family's aid. While on the run from Cemetery Wind and Lockdown, Lucas is killed by one of Lockdown's grenades. Escaping into the desert, they take refuge in an abandoned gas station. Later, Optimus gains an alternate form after scanning a passing Western Star 5700 XE Phantom Custom truck with the original red and blue paint with flames and summons the surviving Autobots – <a href="/wiki/Bumblebee_(Transformers)" title="Bumblebee (Transformers)">Bumblebee</a>, who has assumed an alternate form (a 1967 Chevrolet Camaro), <a href="/wiki/Hound_(Transformers)" title="Hound (Transformers)">Hound</a>, <a href="/wiki/Drift_(Transformers)" title="Drift (Transformers)">Drift</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Crosshairs_(Transformers)" title="Crosshairs (Transformers)">Crosshairs</a> – who have come to distrust humans due to Cemetery Wind constantly hunting them down. Using a CIA drone which he stole during the home invasion, Cade discovers K.S.I.'s involvement in the attacks on the Autobots. Optimus vows to personally kill Attinger for his actions against his brethren.
</p><p>Infiltrating K.S.I.'s headquarters in <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, Cade discovers the remains of Autobots and Decepticons are being melted down to make the drones. Joshua Joyce, the ambitious company CEO, is in league with Attinger to revolutionize global defenses and improve human society using the Seed. He has captured Brains and used him and data from <a href="/wiki/Megatron" title="Megatron">Megatron</a>'s head to create the drones and prototype Transformer soldiers <a href="/wiki/Galvatron" title="Galvatron">Galvatron</a> and Stinger. In a fit of rage, the Autobots storm the building, during which Bumblebee regains his original form by scanning a passing 2014 Chevrolet Camaro, where they rescue Brains and destroy the laboratory, but they soon leave after Joshua announces that they are no longer needed. Attinger forces Joshua to deploy Galvatron and Stinger to attack the Autobots. During the battle, Galvatron's behavior becomes slightly erratic when it starts destroying vehicles, and when it fights Optimus it speaks to him. Lockdown then arrives and abducts Optimus while Galvatron and Stinger retreat; Tessa is inadvertently captured alongside Optimus in the midst of the chaos, leaving Cade and Shane devastated.
</p><p>While Lockdown's large prison spacecraft hovers over Chicago to hand over the Seed, Cade, Shane, and the Autobots use the opportunity to sneak on board and rescue Optimus and Tessa, hijacking a smaller ship containing a group of Autobots called the <a href="/wiki/Dinobots" title="Dinobots">Dinobots</a>, just before Lockdown leaves Earth. The Autobots reveal to Cade that "Galvatron" is in fact Megatron, who gave K.S.I. the data to build the Transformer drones so he could transfer his consciousness into the Galvatron drone, after they had unknowingly revived him. What's more, Galvatron is plotting to use the Seed and the K.S.I. drones to conquer the world by detonating the Seed in <a href="/wiki/Hong_Kong" title="Hong Kong">Hong Kong</a>, as K.S.I. has brought it there to use it in the remote Mongolian desert to create vast amounts of usable Transformium. Cade informs Joshua of Megatron's presence, causing him to have a change of heart and agreeing to hand over the Seed with help from Darcy and his Chinese business associate Su Yueming. Meanwhile, Lockdown discovers Optimus' escape with the Dinobots, and returns to Earth to retrieve them. Optimus decides for the Autobots to no longer help the humans because of how they revived Megatron, but Cade explains to Optimus why he shouldn't lose faith in them. At the K.S.I. facility, during a disagreement between Joshua and Attinger over the Seed, Galvatron reactivates himself and promptly takes control of the K.S.I. drones, and a battle follows in Hong Kong's streets between Cade's group, the Autobots, Cemetery Wind, Galvatron, and his drones. During the fight, Optimus gains the alliance of the Dinobots, who become essential to the Autobots' victory while Bumblebee kills Stinger.
</p><p>Lockdown returns to capture Optimus and the Dinobots, using a large <a href="/wiki/Magnet" title="Magnet">magnet</a> in his ship that picks up and drops metal objects, causing destruction to the city. After disabling the magnet, Optimus fights Lockdown at an abandoned factory. In the ensuing duel, Optimus kills Attinger (who still angrily deems all Cybertronians aside from Lockdown as a threat) to save Cade, and avenging the deaths of his fellow Autobots, but this allows Lockdown to pin Optimus down by impaling his chest with his own sword. Cade, Bumblebee, Tessa, and Shane fight Lockdown, with Cade ending up fighting him one-on-one while Tessa and Shane use a tow truck to free Optimus, who kills Lockdown by cutting him in half before using one of his grenades to finish off the remaining drones. Galvatron retreats, vowing to return.
</p><p>As Lockdown's ship leaves Earth, Optimus tells the Autobots to protect the Yeagers (with Joshua offering to help the Yeagers build a new home) and lets the Dinobots go, before flying away into space with the Seed to hide it away, sending a message to the Creators that <a href="/wiki/Transformers:_The_Last_Knight" title="Transformers: The Last Knight">he is coming for them</a>.

He finds a smaller AllSpark shard and picks it up, causing him to see Cybertronian symbols. As a side effect, the shard's energy brings various kitchen appliances to life, who then attack Sam and his family. After Bumblebee kills the living appliances, Sam gives the shard to Mikaela, who later captures the Decepticon <a href="/wiki/Lists_of_Transformers_characters" title="Lists of Transformers characters">Wheelie</a> when he attempts to steal it.

Megatron then travels to one of Saturn's moons, where he reunites with his second in command, <a href="/wiki/Starscream" title="Starscream">Starscream</a>, and his master, the Fallen, who orders him to capture Sam alive and kill Optimus, as he is the only Transformer who can defeat the Fallen. After killing Alice, a Decepticon Pretender disguised as a college student, Sam, Mikaela and his college roommate, Leo are captured by the Decepticon Grindor and taken to an abandoned factory. Megatron reveals that the symbols in Sam's mind will lead the Decepticons to a new Energon source before Optimus and Bumblebee arrive to rescue the trio. Optimus engages Megatron, Starscream, and Grindor, killing the latter in the process. After the battle, Megatron kills Optimus by impaling him through the chest from behind, destroying his spark. The other Autobots arrive and attack the Decepticons, forcing Megatron and Starscream to retreat. The Decepticons launch devastating simultaneous attacks around the world, destroying ships in the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Second_Fleet" title="United States Second Fleet">Second Fleet</a> and damaging <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a>.

Sam's group finds the Matrix in <a href="/wiki/Petra" title="Petra">Petra</a>, but it disintegrates into dust in Sam's hands. Undeterred, Sam stuffs the Matrix's remains into his sock.
</p><p>Meanwhile, NEST forces and the Autobots land near the <a href="/wiki/Giza_pyramid_complex" title="Giza pyramid complex">Giza pyramid complex</a> but are attacked by a large force of Decepticons. During the battle, many Constructicons combine to form <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Transformers_(TV_series)_characters" title="List of The Transformers (TV series) characters">Devastator</a>, who destroys one of the pyramids to reveal the Sun Harvester inside before he is killed by a US navy destroyer's <a href="/wiki/Railgun" title="Railgun">railgun</a>. Ravage and the Decepticon Rampage attempt to spring a trap, using Sam's captured parents as bait, in order to force Sam to give them the Matrix, but Bumblebee interferes and kills them both. Major William Lennox and Master Sergeant Robert Epps call in an airstrike that kills the majority of the Decepticon ground forces. However, Megatron manages to shoot Sam, mortally wounding him, before Megatron is forced to retreat. As Sam nears death the Primes contact him through a vision, saying that the Matrix must be earned, not found, and that he has now earned the right to bear it. They restore Sam's life and the Matrix, which he uses to revive Optimus.
</p><p>The Fallen teleports to their location and steals the Matrix from Optimus, then returns to the pyramid with Megatron and activates the Sun Harvester. Jetfire, who was gravely wounded by Scorponok during the battle (but was able to kill his attacker), sacrifices himself in order to transplant his parts to Optimus, which gives Optimus immense strength and the ability to fly. He knocks the Fallen and Megatron off the pyramid, destroying the Sun Harvester in the process. In the battle, Optimus incapacitates Megatron and kills the Fallen; Megatron retreats with Starscream, vowing vengeance. The victorious Autobots and their allies then go back to the United States and Sam returns to college.
</p><p>Several thousand years ago, the planet <a href="/wiki/Cybertron" title="Cybertron">Cybertron</a> was consumed by a <a href="/wiki/Civil_war" title="Civil war">civil war</a> between the two <a href="/wiki/Transformers" title="Transformers">Transformer</a> factions, the <a href="/wiki/Autobot" title="Autobot">Autobots</a> led by <a href="/wiki/Optimus_Prime" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus Prime</a> and the <a href="/wiki/Decepticon" title="Decepticon">Decepticons</a> led by <a href="/wiki/Megatron" title="Megatron">Megatron</a>. Optimus jettisoned the <a href="/wiki/Spark_(Transformers)" title="Spark (Transformers)">AllSpark</a>, a mystical artifact that brings life to the planet, into space, but Megatron pursued it. Megatron crashed onto <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>, landing in the <a href="/wiki/Arctic_Circle" title="Arctic Circle">Arctic Circle</a> and froze, and was discovered in 1895 by explorer Archibald Witwicky.

</p><p>Meanwhile, Sam buys his first car, a rusting <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet_Camaro" title="Chevrolet Camaro">Chevrolet Camaro</a>, but discovers it has a life of its own. Sam and his high school crush Mikaela Banes are rescued from Barricade and Frenzy by the Camaro who turns out to be Autobot scout <a href="/wiki/Bumblebee_(Transformers)" title="Bumblebee (Transformers)">Bumblebee</a>, who has to communicate through his car radio due to being mute.

Optimus explains the details of the situation, revealing that if Megatron gained the AllSpark he would transform Earth's machinery into a new army and exterminate mankind. Sam, Mikaela, and the Autobots travel to Sam's house to retrieve the glasses, but they are captured by agents of Sector Seven, a top-secret paramilitary government branch, led by Seymour Simmons. The Autobots stop the agents, but they call for backup, who take Sam, Mikaela, and Bumblebee into custody, while Optimus obtains the glasses, and uses them to locate the Allspark.
</p><p>The humans respectfully connected to the Transformers are gathered together at <a href="/wiki/Hoover_Dam" title="Hoover Dam">Hoover Dam</a> by Sector Seven's director Tom Banachek, who reveals Megatron, still frozen, and the AllSpark. Frenzy, having smuggled away in Mikaela's bag, disables Megatron’s cryonics system and summons <a href="/wiki/Starscream" title="Starscream">Starscream</a>, who in turn summons <a href="/wiki/Brawl_(Transformers)" title="Brawl (Transformers)">Brawl</a> and Bonecrusher, the latter being killed by Optimus on a highway. Bumblebee is released to protect the AllSpark, shrinking it to a handheld size so it can be transported to safety. Megatron escapes the dam after thawing out. Frenzy attacks Secretary Keller, Madsen and Agent Simmons in the Dam's radio room, trying to prevent them from summoning the Air Force, but is decapitated by his own ricocheting <a href="/wiki/Shuriken" title="Shuriken">shuriken</a>.
</p><p>A lengthy battle occurs in Mission City,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-5"><a href="#cite_note-5">[5]</a></sup> with Blackout and Brawl dying at the hands of the military and Bumblebee respectively. However, Megatron kills Jazz and prevents Sam's attempted escape with the AllSpark. Optimus arrives to protect Sam, and engages in a battle against Megatron, with the latter getting the upper hand. Optimus tells Sam to push the cube into his chest to ensure their mutual destruction, but instead rams it into Megatron's chest, overloading his <a href="/wiki/Spark_(Transformers)" title="Spark (Transformers)">spark</a> and killing him..
</p><p>Optimus salvages a shard of the AllSpark from Megatron's mangled corpse. The United States government shuts down Sector Seven and disposes of the dead Decepticons in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Laurentian_Abyss" title="Laurentian Abyss">Laurentian Abyss</a>. Sam and Mikaela then start a romantic relationship while the Autobots secretly hide out on Earth, and Optimus sends a transmission into space inviting any surviving Autobots to join them.

Elsewhere, <a href="/wiki/Merlin" title="Merlin">Merlin</a> approaches the Knights of Iacon, a group of Transformers hiding on <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>, to help win the war. They hand him an alien staff, before transforming together into Dragonstorm and turn the tide of the battle, but warn Merlin that a great evil will come for the staff.
</p><p>In the present, three years after the Hong Kong Uprising,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Timeline_10-0"><a href="#cite_note-Timeline-10">[N 1]</a></sup> in 2017, <a href="/wiki/Optimus_Prime" title="Optimus Prime">Optimus</a> crash-lands on <a href="/wiki/Cybertron" title="Cybertron">Cybertron</a>, and meets his alleged creator <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Quintessons" title="Quintessons">Quintessa</a>. She blames Optimus for Cybertron's destruction and brainwashes him into helping her gain Merlin's staff, which can absorb Earth's energy to restore Cybertron. Optimus is renamed Nemesis Prime. Earth is revealed to be the slumbering <a href="/wiki/Unicron" title="Unicron">Unicron</a>, the ancient enemy of Cybertron, and whose horns are emerging across the planet.
</p><p>On Earth, Transformers remain unwelcome among humanity, apart from in <a href="/wiki/Cuba" title="Cuba">Cuba</a>, and are hunted by the Transformers Reaction Force (TRF), a paramilitary force manufactured from the fallen Cemetery Wind. However, the U.S. military, particularly those who had formerly worked with the Transformers, such as Colonel William Lennox, is secretly against the new policy. Cade Yeager, an ally to the Autobots, helps hide refugee Transformers from the TRF in his remote junkyard. In the war-torn <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>, Cade, <a href="/wiki/Bumblebee_(Transformers)" title="Bumblebee (Transformers)">Bumblebee</a>, young scavenger Izabella and her Transformer companions Sqweeks and Canopy help a group of children evade the TRF drones, but Canopy is killed by a fighter jet. Cade receives a mechanical talisman from a dying Autobot knight and has a brief standoff with the TRF and their leader, Santos, before being saved by Bumblebee, Lennox, and Hound. Cade returns to his junkyard with Izabella and Sqweeks with the talisman. Both <a href="/wiki/Megatron" title="Megatron">Megatron</a> and the U.S. government become aware of the talisman's value and power, reluctantly joining forces to obtain it. A group of Decepticon prisoners  are released to aid in the mission.
</p><p>The Decepticons and the TRF locate Cade's hideout with the help of a tracker previously planted on Bumblebee. Cade, his assistant Jimmy, Izabella, and Sqweeks flee from the Decepticons and the TRF to an abandoned town where the Autobots ambush their enemies and defeat them while Cade, Jimmy, and Izabella battle a unit of TRF drones. Cogman, a <a href="/wiki/Steampunk" title="Steampunk">steampunk</a> Transformer, appears and invites Cade to the <a href="/wiki/United_Kingdom" title="United Kingdom">United Kingdom</a> to meet his employer, Sir Edmund Burton, who has connections to the Transformers. Burton also has another Transformer associate named Hot Rod who he orders to find Viviane Wembley, a <a href="/wiki/University_of_Oxford" title="University of Oxford">University of Oxford</a> professor, and bring her to him. On his way back, Hot Rod gains an alternate form after scanning a passing Lamborghini Centenario LP770-4 sports car.
</p><p>Bringing Cade, Viviane, and Bumblebee together, Burton explains that Transformers have been aiding mankind in war for centuries, their existence hidden by a <a href="/wiki/Secret_society" title="Secret society">secret society</a> of famed historical figures, the Order of Witwiccans, of which he is the last living member. The talisman can lead to Merlin's staff, buried with him in a Cybertronian spacecraft hidden under the sea. However, only a direct descendant of Merlin can wield it due to the knights encoding his <a href="/wiki/DNA" title="DNA">DNA</a> into it. Viviane is revealed as the last of Merlin's bloodline. The TRF and local authorities discover them, forcing them to flee. Following a series of clues while evading their pursuers, the group head to the Royal Navy Museum. There, Cade, Viviane, Bumblebee, and Cogman commandeer the museum submarine <a href="/wiki/HMS_Alliance_(P417)" title="HMS Alliance (P417)">HMS <i>Alliance</i></a>, also a Transformer, to find the spacecraft. The TRF, after a failed attempt to stop the <i>Alliance</i>, pursue them in DSV submarines.
</p><p>Burton contacts Seymour Simmons, both learning that Earth is Unicron, and the staff will be used to drain the planet's life, via an access point hidden under <a href="/wiki/Stonehenge" title="Stonehenge">Stonehenge</a>. Locating the ship, Cade and Viviane discover Merlin's tomb and obtain the staff. Viviane activates it, causing the spacecraft to become airborne, awakening the Knights of Iacon. As the TRF, now under Lennox, try to take the staff from them, Nemesis Prime arrives, forcing the humans to surrender the staff. Bumblebee, Lennox, and Cade confront Nemesis who engages in battle with Bumblebee. Just as Nemesis is about to finish him off, the formerly-mute Bumblebee begins speaking in his own voice (rather than the radio), stirring Optimus' memories and freeing him from Quintessa's control. The Decepticons ambush Optimus and Cade and steal the staff from him. The Knights try to execute Optimus for his "betrayal," but Cade stops them when his talisman transforms into <a href="/wiki/Excalibur" title="Excalibur">Excalibur</a>. The Knights yield and join the humans and Autobots. Burton tries to stop Megatron from activating the staff at Stonehenge only to be mortally wounded, dying peacefully with Cogman at his side. At the same time, Cybertron's remains collide with Earth to begin draining energy from it, devastating the planet and killing millions. The Autobots, Dragonstorm, and human military forces converge on Stonehenge and Cybertron, attacking the Decepticons and Quintessa's minions, who either flee or are killed while Quintessa is defeated by Optimus and Bumblebee. The worlds are then saved upon Viviane removing the staff and the Autobots leave Earth to rebuild what is left of Cybertron. In a mid-credits scene, Quintessa, who has survived by using a space bridge to escape and is disguised as a human, approaches a group of scientists inspecting one of Unicron's horns, offering a way to destroy him.

B-127 flees from the soldiers, scans a nearby 1967 <a href="/wiki/Volkswagen_Beetle" title="Volkswagen Beetle">Volkswagen Beetle</a> and collapses from his injuries.
</p><p>In 1987, teenager Charlie Watson remains traumatized by the death of her father, and resentful of her mother Sally for moving on too quickly with a new boyfriend named Ron. Charlie finds a yellow Volkswagen Beetle (which is actually B-127) in a scrapyard belonging to Hank, who gives it to her as an 18th birthday present. When trying to start it, Charlie unknowingly activates a homing signal that is detected by Decepticons Shatter and Dropkick as they interrogate and execute the Autobot <a href="/wiki/Cliffjumper" title="Cliffjumper">Cliffjumper</a> on one of <a href="/wiki/Moons_of_Saturn" title="Moons of Saturn">Saturn's moons</a>. The pair heads to Earth, where they adapt Earth vehicle forms and pretend to be peacekeepers, persuading Dr. Powell and the rest of Sector 7, despite Burns's disagreement, to help them find and capture B-127, whom they claim is a fugitive and a traitor.
</p><p>While Charlie attempts to fix the Beetle, it transforms into B-127, whom she befriends and nicknames "Bumblebee". She then unknowingly unlocks a message from Optimus urging Bumblebee to defend Earth in their absence, which restores some of his memories. Bumblebee begins to speak using songs. He is discovered by Charlie's neighbor Memo, who agrees to protect their secret due to his feelings for Charlie. Left alone, Bumblebee accidentally destroys Charlie’s home and causes an energy spike that attracts Sector 7’s attention. When Sally blames Charlie for the destruction, Charlie finally expresses her pain over her father’s death and angrily leaves with Bumblebee and Memo, only to be intercepted by Sector 7 and the Decepticons. Bumblebee is captured while Charlie and Memo are returned home.
</p><p>Charlie convinces her brother Otis to cover for her and Memo as they follow Burns to the Sector 7 outpost where Bumblebee is being held. Shatter and Dropkick torture Bumblebee into revealing the Autobots’ whereabouts, discovering that the Autobots are coming to Earth. They leave him for dead after revealing their plan to bring the Decepticons to Earth. After alerting Burns to the truth about the Decepticons, Dr. Powell is killed by Dropkick.
</p><p>Charlie electroshocks Bumblebee back to life, restoring his memories. After fighting past Burns' obstruction and attempt to re-secure Bumblebee with the help of Memo, Sally, Ron, and Otis, Charlie and Bumblebee set out to prevent Shatter and Dropkick from contacting the Decepticons using a radio tower at a nearby harbor. Burns also intervenes and defends Charlie. His helicopter is shot down by Shatter, but Burns is saved by Bumblebee. While Bumblebee fights Dropkick, he binds him with a chain, entangling his systems when he transforms, and Bumblebee rips him apart. Charlie deactivates the Decepticon beacon, causing an enraged Shatter to pursue her. Bumblebee destroys a dam wall, triggering a flood that causes a cargo ship to crush Shatter into the docks, killing her. Burns, having a change of heart and grateful towards Bumblebee, gives him and Charlie time to escape before the army arrives, having yet to convince them that Bumblebee is not the enemy. Charlie and Bumblebee arrive on a cliff overlooking the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge" title="Golden Gate Bridge">Golden Gate Bridge</a>, where Charlie, realizing that Bumblebee has a greater purpose on Earth, says goodbye. Bumblebee scans a <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet_Camaro_(second_generation)#1977" title="Chevrolet Camaro (second generation)">1977 Chevrolet Camaro</a>, transforms into a yellow version of it, and drives away, and Charlie reunites with her family and Memo.
</p><p>Using his new name, Bumblebee reunites with Optimus Prime. Prime praises Bumblebee for keeping Earth safe as they watch more Autobots arrive through Earth's atmosphere. Meanwhile, Charlie finally finishes repairing the <a href="/wiki/Chevrolet_Corvette_(C1)" title="Chevrolet Corvette (C1)">Corvette</a> she and her father were working on, and drives off into the sunset.

The Kraken drags Jack and the <i>Pearl</i> to Davy Jones' Locker. Jones opens the chest to discover his heart is gone. In Port Royal, Norrington gives Beckett the heart and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Letters_of_Marque" title="Letters of Marque">Letters of Marque</a> meant for Jack, allowing him back into the navy as well as allowing Beckett to gain control of Davy Jones and the seas.

</p><p>Jack refuses the offer and escapes. He meets up with his father, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Captain_Teague" title="Captain Teague">Captain Teague</a>, who warns Jack about the Fountain's rituals. Jack learns someone is impersonating him to recruit a crew to find the Fountain. The impostor is <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Angelica_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" title="Angelica (Pirates of the Caribbean)">Angelica</a>, Jack's former lover, and the daughter of the ruthless pirate <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Blackbeard_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" title="Blackbeard (Pirates of the Caribbean)">Blackbeard</a>, who practices <a href="/wiki/Haitian_Vodou" title="Haitian Vodou">voodoo</a> magic and wields the mythical "Sword of <a href="/wiki/Triton_(mythology)" title="Triton (mythology)">Triton</a>" that controls his ship, the <i><a href="/wiki/Queen_Anne%27s_Revenge" title="Queen Anne's Revenge">Queen Anne's Revenge</a></i>. While Jack is <a href="/wiki/Shanghaiing" title="Shanghaiing">shanghaied</a> aboard Blackbeard's ship, Gibbs escapes execution by memorizing and destroying Jack's map showing the Fountain's location, forcing Barbossa to take him along.
</p><p>Meanwhile, after a failed <a href="/wiki/Mutiny" title="Mutiny">mutiny</a> aboard the <i>Queen Anne's Revenge</i>, Jack is forced to guide the crew to the Fountain. Blackbeard seeks the Fountain's power to circumvent his predestined fatal encounter with a "one-legged man", who happened to be Barbossa. Jack must find two silver chalices aboard <a href="/wiki/Juan_Ponce_de_Le%C3%B3n" title="Juan Ponce de León">Juan Ponce de León</a>'s missing <a href="/wiki/Flagship" title="Flagship">flagship</a>, the <i>Santiago</i>. The Fountain's water must simultaneously be drunk by two people from the chalices. Drinking from one chalice containing a <a href="/wiki/Mermaid" title="Mermaid">mermaid</a>'s tear will extend life; the second person dies, their remaining years of life transferred to the other drinker. Jack also discovers that the <i>Black Pearl</i> was captured and shrunk before being added to Blackbeard's collection of other shrunken <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ship_in_a_bottle" title="Ship in a bottle">ships in bottles</a>.
</p><p>The <i>Queen Anne's Revenge</i> heads for Whitecap Bay to find and harvest mermaid tears. After managing to lure in a mermaid named Tamara, she summons other mermaids to attack the crew before Jack causes an explosion that scares them away. A mermaid named Syrena is caught, but Philip Swift, a captive missionary, falls in love with her. Reaching Ponce de León's ship on an uncharted island, Angelica and Blackbeard coerce Jack into retrieving both chalices. Jack locates the grounded, decaying vessel, only to find Barbossa there. Both guess that the Spanish have taken the chalices, after they are nowhere to be found on the vessel.
</p><p>Jack and Barbossa team up to sneak into the Spanish camp and steal the chalices. Barbossa reveals he only wants revenge against Blackbeard for attacking the <i>Black Pearl</i>, and his leg being amputated. Jack and Barbossa escape with the chalices. Meanwhile, Syrena, reciprocating Philip's love, is tricked into shedding a tear. Blackbeard collects it, leaving her to die of dehydration while Philip is forced to go with them. Jack returns with the chalices and bargains with Blackbeard for Angelica's safety, Jack's confiscated magical compass (which they took from him before sending him to get the chalices), and Gibbs' release. In return, Jack vows to give Blackbeard the chalices and lead him to the Fountain; Blackbeard agrees, and Gibbs is set free with the compass.
</p><p>At the Fountain, Blackbeard's crew is confronted by Barbossa and his men and they battle while Barbossa and Blackbeard fight. The Spanish suddenly arrive, intending to destroy the Fountain, believing its power an abomination against God. They crush the chalices and throw them in the swamp. When Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with a poisoned sword, Angelica pulls it out but is cut and poisoned. Jack notices Angelica is poisoned and begins frantically searching the swamp for the chalices. Barbossa obtains Blackbeard's magic sword and gains control of the <i>Queen Anne's Revenge</i> and her crew. Despite resistance from Blackbeard's crew, the Spanish successfully pull down a pillar, crushing the Fountain of Youth. The Spanish army leaves once the fountain is in ruins. Philip is mortally wounded, but he returns to free Syrena. She helps Jack retrieve the missing chalices and gives them to him, telling him not to waste her tear. Syrena goes back to the dying Philip. She says she can save him if he asks her to. When he asks for her forgiveness, she kisses him and takes him underwater.
</p><p>With Blackbeard and Angelica both nearing death, Jack retrieves the last remaining drops of water from the destroyed fountain and puts the tear in one of them. Knowing that one of them must be sacrificed, he wants Angelica to drink from the chalice containing the tear. Instead, Blackbeard drinks it, asking his daughter to save him. Angelica agrees and drinks from the second chalice. Jack is upset to lose Angelica, but reveals that he made a mistake about which chalice contained the tear. Neither of the two are happy, and they both believe Jack deliberately tricked them. Angelica's wounds are healed as the Fountain fatally consumes Blackbeard's body, killing him.
</p><p>Eventually, Jack and Angelica admit their love for each other, yet he distrusts her intentions (aware that she may try to avenge her father) and strands her on a <a href="/wiki/Cay" title="Cay">cay</a>. Now wielding Blackbeard's magical sword, Barbossa captains the <i>Queen Anne's Revenge</i> and returns to piracy. Jack finds Gibbs, who had used the compass to locate the <i>Revenge</i>. He reclaims the shrunken <i>Black Pearl</i> and the other conquered ships in bottles, carrying them in a <a href="/wiki/Gunny_sack" title="Gunny sack">gunny sack</a>. The two leave, <a href="/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_Dead_Men_Tell_No_Tales" title="Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales">hoping to revert the <i>Black Pearl</i> to its original size and continue living the pirates' life</a>.

</p><p>The crew travels to the Locker and rescues Jack. The crew encounters many dead souls, including Elizabeth's father <a href="/wiki/Weatherby_Swann" title="Weatherby Swann">Governor Swann</a>, who was executed by Beckett. Tia Dalma reveals that the Goddess Calypso charged Davy Jones with the job to guide the souls of those who died at sea to the next world. Once every ten years he could come ashore to be with the woman he loved. But he corrupted his purpose and was cursed to become a monster. The soul of Governor Swann reveals that the <i>Dutchman</i> must always have a captain.
</p><p>Returning to the living world, the <i>Pearl</i> stops at an island for fresh water, where the crew find the <a href="/wiki/Kraken_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" title="Kraken (Pirates of the Caribbean)">Kraken</a> lying dead on the beach, having been killed by Jones under orders from Beckett. They are then attacked by Sao Feng and Beckett's men. Through a complex series of deals, Elizabeth is handed over to Feng, who believes she is the goddess <a href="/wiki/Calypso_(mythology)" title="Calypso (mythology)">Calypso</a>, while the rest of the crew make for Shipwreck Cove aboard the <i>Pearl</i>. Jack throws Will off the ship as part of the plan to seize control of the <i>Dutchman</i>. Sao Feng tells Elizabeth that the first Brethren Court bound Calypso in human form after she betrayed her lover, Davy Jones. He plans to release her to defeat Beckett. Davy Jones attacks Feng's ship, the <i>Empress</i>, mortally wounding Feng in the process. Feng appoints Elizabeth his successor as Pirate Lord before dying. Elizabeth and the crew are locked in the brig of the <i>Dutchman</i>, where she finds a partially insane Bootstrap Bill Turner. In a moment of clarity, Bootstrap reveals that whoever kills Davy Jones must take his place, bound to serve the <i>Dutchman</i> forever. He reiterates that "the <i>Dutchman</i> must always have a captain." <a href="/wiki/James_Norrington" title="James Norrington">Admiral Norrington</a> frees Elizabeth and her new crew from the <i>Dutchman</i>, but is killed by Bootstrap Bill.
</p><p>The <i>Black Pearl</i> arrives at Shipwreck Cove, where Barbossa attempts to persuade the Brethren Court to release Calypso. Davy Jones visits Tia Dalma in the <i>Pearl</i>'s brig, revealing she is Calypso. Jack's father <a href="/wiki/List_of_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_characters#Captain_Teague" title="List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters">Captain Teague</a>, Keeper of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pirate_Code" title="Pirate Code">Pirate Code</a>, informs the Court that only an elected Pirate King can decide on going into battle.

Jack and Elizabeth escape the <i>Dutchman</i> as it is sucked into the maelstrom.
</p><p>As Beckett's ship, the <i>Endeavour</i>, approaches to destroy the <i>Pearl</i>, the <i>Dutchman</i> rises from the sea, now captained by Will; the crew has been freed from Jones' curse. Together, the two pirate ships destroy the <i>Endeavour</i>. A stunned Beckett goes down with his ship while his navy retreats. With Will now forever bound to escort souls lost at sea to the next world, he and Elizabeth bid farewell to each other on the beach of an abandoned island.

Henry intends to recruit <a href="/wiki/Jack_Sparrow" title="Jack Sparrow">Captain Jack Sparrow</a> to help find it, but Will believes this is impossible and orders Henry to leave.

</p><p>Nine years later, Henry is a sailor in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/British_Royal_Navy" title="British Royal Navy">British Royal Navy</a>. The ship sails into the supernatural <a href="/wiki/Bermuda_Triangle" title="Bermuda Triangle">Devil's Triangle</a> and stumbles upon the wreck of the <i>Silent Mary</i>, whose ghostly crew led by Spanish pirate-hunter <a href="/wiki/List_of_Pirates_of_the_Caribbean_characters#Armando_Salazar" title="List of Pirates of the Caribbean characters">Captain Salazar</a> attack. Salazar spares Henry's life to deliver a message to Jack: Salazar is coming for him.

Having suffered years of such bad luck, Jack's crew lose faith and abandon him. Depressed, Jack trades his magical compass for a drink. However, this betrayal of the compass frees Salazar and his crew from the Devil's Triangle. Carina learns Henry is looking for the Trident's location and offers to help him using her unknown father's diary. Carina and Jack are captured and face execution, but are saved by Henry and Jack's crew, setting sail on the <i>Dying Gull</i>. Carina deciphers clues that the stars will lead to an island where the Trident is hidden.
</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Hector_Barbossa" title="Hector Barbossa">Captain Barbossa</a> hears from his pirate crew that the revived Captain Salazar has killed several pirates at sea, and learns that the Trident could lead him to a new "treasure". Barbossa sets off to find the Trident until Salazar and his crew appear and destroy Barbossa's fleet. Barbossa manages to talk his way out of being killed by offering to help find Jack. Salazar agrees, wanting revenge on the pirate that caused his demise. Salazar pursues the <i>Dying Gull</i>, forcing Jack, Henry, and Carina to flee to an island, discovering that Salazar's crew cannot go on land. After saving Jack from a forced marriage, Barbossa allies himself with Jack, returning his compass and restoring the miniaturized <i><a href="/wiki/Black_Pearl" title="Black Pearl">Black Pearl</a></i>, <a href="/wiki/Pirates_of_the_Caribbean:_On_Stranger_Tides" title="Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides">trapped in a bottle by Blackbeard</a>, to its original size. They all continue their journey to the Trident's island, with Barbossa taking command of the <i>Pearl</i> once more. During the voyage, Jack and Barbossa realize Carina is the latter's long-lost daughter. Barbossa tells Jack that he had left her at an orphanage with his diary so she could live a better life, and refuses to tell her the truth so she will continue to believe her father was an astronomer.
</p><p>Approaching the Trident's island, the <i>Pearl</i> evades a British Navy warship, which is destroyed by the <i>Silent Mary</i> before the <i>Pearl</i> runs aground on the island. Jack, Barbossa, and Carina use the island's magic to part the ocean and open a path to the Trident's location on the ocean floor. Salazar captures Henry and inhabits then takes control of him in order to walk on the ocean floor and seize the Trident. Once he does so, Henry is given his body back, and Jack distracts Salazar, allowing Henry to destroy the Trident, breaking all curses upon the sea and restoring Salazar's crew to life. However, the divided sea begins to collapse in on itself. The <i>Pearl</i> lowers its <a href="/wiki/Anchor" title="Anchor">anchor</a> to lift them to safety, but Salazar pursues them, still hell-bent on killing Jack. Carina realizes that Barbossa is her father when she spots a tattoo on his arm identical to the diary's cover. Barbossa sacrifices himself to kill Salazar, allowing the others to escape alive.
</p><p>Sometime later, Henry and Carina reach Port Royal, where Will appears, free from the <i>Dutchman</i>. His wife, <a href="/wiki/Elizabeth_Swann" title="Elizabeth Swann">Elizabeth</a>, appears moments later and the Turner family reunites. Henry and Carina begin a relationship as well. Jack watches from the <i>Pearl</i> in faux-disgust before sailing away into the horizon, having been accepted by his crew as their captain once again.
</p><p>In a <a href="/wiki/Post-credits_scene" title="Post-credits scene">post-credits scene</a>, Will and Elizabeth sleep in their bed together, when their room is intruded by <a href="/wiki/Davy_Jones_(Pirates_of_the_Caribbean)" title="Davy Jones (Pirates of the Caribbean)">Davy Jones</a>.

Elizabeth discovers a golden pirate medallion around his neck, and keeps it in order to protect him.
</p><p>Eight years later, Norrington is promoted to <a href="/wiki/Commodore_(rank)" title="Commodore (rank)">commodore</a> and proposes to Elizabeth. Her <a href="/wiki/Corset" title="Corset">corset</a> makes her faint and fall into the sea, which causes her medallion to emit a pulse. <a href="/wiki/Jack_Sparrow" title="Jack Sparrow">Captain Jack Sparrow</a> comes to Port Royal to commandeer a ship, and rescues Elizabeth. Norrington identifies Jack as a pirate, and a chase ensues. Jack encounters Will, now a <a href="/wiki/Blacksmith" title="Blacksmith">blacksmith</a> and swordsman. They duel, and Jack is captured and imprisoned.
</p><p>That night, the <i><a href="/wiki/Black_Pearl" title="Black Pearl">Black Pearl</a></i> attacks Port Royal in search of the medallion. The crew of the <i>Pearl</i> capture Elizabeth, taking her to meet <a href="/wiki/Hector_Barbossa" title="Hector Barbossa">Captain Barbossa</a>. Elizabeth claims her last name is Turner to conceal her identity as the governor's daughter. She learns that her medallion is one of 882 gold pieces that Barbossa's crew took from a treasure of <a href="/wiki/Hern%C3%A1n_Cort%C3%A9s" title="Hernán Cortés">Hernán Cortés</a> on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Isla_de_Muerta" title="Isla de Muerta">Isla de Muerta</a>.

Barbossa takes her prisoner, believing her to be the daughter of <a href="/wiki/Bootstrap_Bill_Turner" title="Bootstrap Bill Turner">William "Bootstrap Bill" Turner</a>, whose blood is needed to lift the curse. 
</p><p>Will frees Jack to rescue Elizabeth, whom Will loves. Jack, the original <a href="/wiki/Sea_captain" title="Sea captain">captain</a> of the <i>Black Pearl</i> before Barbossa staged a <a href="/wiki/Mutiny" title="Mutiny">mutiny</a>, gets assistance from Will to reclaim his ship. The two commandeer HMS <i>Interceptor</i>, a small and very fast <a href="/wiki/Sloop-of-war" title="Sloop-of-war">sloop-of-war</a>, and head for <a href="/wiki/Tortuga_(Haiti)" title="Tortuga (Haiti)">Tortuga</a> to recruit a crew. At Isla de Muerta, Will and Jack witness Barbossa sacrificing Elizabeth's blood and the final gold piece. The curse is not lifted because Elizabeth does not carry the blood of Bootstrap Bill Turner. Bootstrap had been a crewmate of the <i>Black Pearl</i> before being thrown overboard by the crew for giving the medallion to Will. Will rescues Elizabeth and brings her to <i>Interceptor</i>, while Jack is captured by Barbossa and gets locked in the <a href="/wiki/Military_prison#brig" title="Military prison">brig</a> of the <i>Pearl</i>.
</p><p>The <i>Black Pearl</i> pursues the <i>Interceptor</i>, taking Jack's crew hostage and destroying the ship. Will makes a deal with Barbossa to release Elizabeth in exchange for his blood, but Barbossa exploits a loophole in the agreement, <a href="/wiki/Marooning" title="Marooning">marooning</a> Jack and Elizabeth on a nearby island. Elizabeth makes a <a href="/wiki/Smoke_signal" title="Smoke signal">smoke signal</a>, and Norrington brings HMS <i>Dauntless</i>, a <a href="/wiki/Ship_of_the_line" title="Ship of the line">ship of the line</a>, to rescue Elizabeth and arrest Jack. Elizabeth asks Norrington to return for Will, convincing him by accepting Norrington's marriage proposal.
</p><p>That night, the <i>Dauntless</i> arrives at Isla de Muerta. Jack plans to lure the pirates out to be ambushed by the crew of the 
<i>Dauntless</i>, but the plan goes awry when Barbossa's crew covertly walks underwater to surprise-attack the <i>Dauntless</i> from below. Elizabeth escapes the <i>Dauntless</i> and frees Jack's crew from the brig of the <i>Black Pearl</i>. They refuse to rescue Jack and Will, so Elizabeth sets out on her own while Jack's crew departs aboard the <i>Pearl</i>.
</p><p>Jack frees Will and duels Barbossa, while Elizabeth and Will fight off Barbossa's crewmen Weatherby, Monk and Jacoby. Barbossa stabs Jack in the stomach, but the latter is revealed to be under the Aztec curse, having secretly taken a piece of gold from the chest of Cortés. Jack then shoots Barbossa, and Will drops both coins into the chest, with his and Jack's blood on them. The curse is lifted, causing Barbossa to die from Jack's gunshot; the rest of Barbossa's crew, realizing that they are no longer immortal, surrender and are arrested by the Royal Navy.
</p><p>At Port Royal, Jack is led to the <a href="/wiki/Gallows" title="Gallows">gallows</a> to be hanged for piracy. Elizabeth diverts Norrington's attention and Will attempts a rescue, but Jack and Will are surrounded and held at gunpoint. Elizabeth intercedes and declares her love for Will, leaving Norrington crestfallen. Governor Swann pardons Will and gives his blessing for Elizabeth to marry him. Jack dives into the sea and escapes aboard the nearby <i>Black Pearl</i>, finally reclaiming the ship. Norrington permits Jack and the <i>Pearl</i> "one day's head start" before initiating pursuit.

Most of Gru's <a href="/wiki/Minions_(Despicable_Me)" title="Minions (Despicable Me)">Minions</a> leave him when he refuses to return to villainy despite losing his job and having Dr. Nefario frozen in carbonite, with Dave and Jerry staying due to not knowing. Meanwhile, Lucy struggles to adapt to her new role as the children's new mom. The next morning, when a butler named Fritz arrives at the Gru house, Gru discovers that he has a twin brother named Dru, who lives in a distant country named Freedonia, who longs to meet him. Shocked to learn he has a twin, Gru confronts his mother, who reveals that when she and her husband divorced, they agreed to keep one child each. The family decides to travel to meet Dru, and they are surprised at his immense wealth, the size of the mansion, which Fritz attributes to their pig farm business. Meanwhile, the Minions are arrested for trespassing at a talent show set. Bratt manages to steal the diamond again, intending to use it to power a giant robot and destroy Hollywood as revenge for the cancellation of his show.
</p><p>Dru reveals to Gru that their recently deceased father was a legendary supervillain, whose villainous activities are the real source of the family's wealth. As Dru was dismissed by their father as a disgrace, he asks his brother to teach him how to be a villain. When Gru refuses to revert to his old ways, Dru takes him on a joyride around Freedonia in their father's technologically advanced car and the siblings bond. Meanwhile, Lucy tries to balance her new tasks as a mom, which she exhibits after turning away a young boy named Niko who had fallen for Margo in the midst of a traditional cheese festival, while Edith and Agnes stumble into a local tavern and learn from the bartender about a mythical <a href="/wiki/Unicorn" title="Unicorn">unicorn</a> which lurks in a nearby forest.

The next day, Agnes and Edith set out into the woods to track the mythical 'unicorn', only to find a one-horned <a href="/wiki/Goat" title="Goat">goat</a> whom Agnes adopts and dubs "Lucky". Meanwhile, the Minions' longing for Gru motivates them to escape from prison and return to their former master.
</p><p>Dru convinces Gru to steal the diamond, with Gru secretly intending to bring it to the AVL, which he hopes will convince Da Vinci to rehire him and Lucy. Despite several setbacks, they manage to retrieve the diamond and are rescued by Lucy after narrowly escaping. After finding out Gru's true motives, Dru confronts his brother about his lie. In return, Gru insults him and decides to leave Freedonia, ending their relationship. Bratt, disguised as Lucy, kidnaps the children, and once again acquires the diamond. Gru and Dru resolve their differences and pursue him after finding the real Lucy.
</p><p>With his robot powered by the diamond, Bratt terrorizes Hollywood, intending to send it into space with the use of superpowered gum. Lucy saves the children while Gru and Dru weaken Bratt's robot with the weapons of their father's car. Gru is knocked unconscious when the car is destroyed, and Dru manages to destroy the robot's core from the inside when Bratt threatens to kill Gru. When Gru recovers, he battles Bratt in a dance fight, using it as a distraction to grab his weaponized <a href="/wiki/Keytar" title="Keytar">keytar</a>, and defeats him. Having rendezvoused with Gru, the Minions manage to destroy the gum already covering the city, and Gru and Dru reunite.
</p><p>Soon afterward, Gru and Lucy are reinstated in the AVL and the newly united family celebrate in Gru's home. Lucy is acknowledged by the children as their mother. Lured back to villainy, Dru, along with most of the Minions, steals Gru's airship, with Gru's emblem replaced with a "D" graffiti. Gru and Lucy decide to give them a five-minute head-start before engaging pursuit.
</p><p>A mysterious vehicle using a giant magnet steals a highly potent mutagen known as PX-41 from a secret laboratory in the Arctic Circle. The Anti-Villain League (AVL), led by Silas Ramsbottom, sends one of his agents, Lucy Wilde to collect Gru, who was former super-villain. Meanwhile, at Gru's house, it is one of his daughters Agnes's birthday and hosts a party for her, Later Lucy Wilde uses her lipstick taser to get Gru to the AVL headquarters, two minions witness the kidnapping and try to save Gru but get electrocuted by Lucy, When they make it at the AVL Silas Ramsbottom introduces himself (much to Gru and the minions amusement) and tells him he was taken there to track down the culprit of the person who stole the lab and recover the mutagen. However, Gru refuses, claiming that he is now a legitimate businessman of making jelly out of every fruit there is but the jelly turns out to taste horrible and the devoted father to Margo, Edith, and Agnes. Longing to resume his criminal life, Dr. Nefario, Gru's friend and assistant, leaves Gru for new employment. Gru reluctantly agrees to investigate the theft and works with undercover AVL agent Lucy Wilde.
</p><p>The pair begin their search in the Paradise Shopping Mall, disguised as bakery employees. Gru immediately suspects the Mexican restaurant owner, Eduardo Pérez, of being the infamous "El Macho", a legendary super-villain who supposedly died by riding a shark into the mouth of an active volcano with 250 pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest. Gru and Lucy break into Eduardo's restaurant at night but find no proof. Meanwhile, Agnes, who dreams of having a mother one day, believes that Gru will fall in love with Lucy. Gru denies it, saying his relationship with Lucy is only professional.
</p><p>Although holding Eduardo as his prime suspect, Gru agrees to pursue others, including wig merchant Floyd Eagle-san. After witnessing Eduardo's two-timing son, Antonio, woo Margo and invite everyone to his Cinco de Mayo party, Gru renews his focus on Eduardo. His neighbor, Jillian, sets him up on a dinner date with her vacuous friend Shannon. The date goes awry, but Lucy arrives and rescues Gru from being humiliated by shooting Shannon with a tranquilizer gun. While they take Shannon home, Gru and Lucy spend personal time together, and Gru falls in love with her.
</p><p>The next day, the AVL arrest Eagle-san after finding an almost-empty jar of the mutagen in his shop, and the investigation is closed by Ramsbottom. Lucy is reassigned to Australia and gives Gru her lipstick taser as a gift before leaving. A heartbroken Gru, having lacked the courage to ask Lucy out on a date, instead takes the girls to the Cinco de Mayo party. There, he follows Eduardo and discovers a secret musical steps-activated elevator, where he finally finds proof that Eduardo is El Macho.
</p><p>On her flight, Lucy, realizing that she has also fallen in love with Gru, jumps out of the plane and uses a hang-glider to reach the party. Gru discovers that El Macho, who has hired Nefario as a partner, has been abducting Gru's Minions and using the stolen PX-41 serum to make them rabid and indestructible. El Macho plans to launch rockets full of the mutated Minions into major cities in order to dominate the world. He offers Gru the chance to team up with him, but Gru walks away and El Macho sends one of his minions after him.
</p><p>Gru takes the girls home and finds a heartbroken Margo as Antonio has chosen another girl to dance with other than her and Gru freezes him, Lucy later arrives at the party right after Gru leaves, but El Macho captures Lucy after Pollito, El Macho's pet chicken, retrieves her AVL ID badge from her purse. Nefario rejoins Gru and tells him that Lucy has been captured, Gru goes back to his fortress with two of his own minions. Meanwhile, back at Gru's house, The minion that El Macho released finds his home and attacks the girls, but Nefario comes to their rescue as he had created an antidote to the serum and puts it in the jelly. Gru enters the fortress with two disguised minions covered with purple paint pretending to be captured to help him enter El Macho's fortress, but one of the minions wipe some paint of his face with his glove revealing to all the purple minions that he is not one of them and the kidnapping was fake, therefore the purple minions attack and corner them, Luckily Nefario, the girls and the rest of Gru's minions who are in normal state arrive with the antidote and returned all the Minions to their normal state. El Macho then applies the mutagen on himself and turns into a monster, but Gru and Nefario defeat him using Lucy's lipstick taser and a fart gun.
</p><p>Gru finds Lucy strapped to a TNT-loaded shark rocket and starts to untie her, but Pollito launches the rocket, sending it flying towards the same volcano where El Macho previously faked his death. Lucy accepts Gru's invitation for a date, and the pair dive into the ocean seconds before the rocket enters the volcano and violently explodes. Gru rejoins the AVL, and he and Lucy eventually get married, giving Margo, Edith and Agnes a mother and it is revealed that there was still one minion that the PX-41 antidote was never given to him.
</p><p>A supervillain named Gru has his pride injured when an unknown villain steals the <a href="/wiki/Great_Pyramid_of_Giza" title="Great Pyramid of Giza">Great Pyramid of Giza</a>. With the assistance of his sidekick Dr. Nefario and his Minions, Gru resolves to one-up his mysterious rival by shrinking and stealing the Moon. Knowing this is extremely costly, Gru seeks a loan from the Bank of Evil. Mr. Perkins - the bank president - is impressed by the plan, but he will approve the loan only if Gru can obtain the necessary shrink ray first. Upon learning that an up-and-coming villain known as Vector was responsible for the Pyramid theft, Gru starts a rivalry with him.
</p><p>Gru and the Minions steal the shrink ray from a secret testing base in East Asia, but Vector intercepts them and steals it for himself. Gru attempts to break into Vector's impregnable fortress to recover the shrink ray, only to be defeated by numerous kinds of traps. As nothing seems to work, he notices three orphan girls, Margo, Edith, and Agnes, who are able to easily enter the base as they are selling cookies. Gru disguises himself and adopts the girls, planning to use them to infiltrate Vector's base. However, Gru has trouble nurturing them properly due to their stubbornness, their ballet classes and his own ineptitude as a parent.
</p><p>Eventually, Gru and the girls arrive at Vector's base, and Gru successfully steals the shrink ray. The girls then suggest a day at a theme park. Gru agrees, believing he can abandon the girls there, but begins to bond with them instead. Later, Gru contacts Perkins via video chat, stating that he finally has the shrink ray. Margo, Edith, and Agnes interrupt the meeting, and Perkins announces that he has lost confidence in Gru and will no longer fund his operations. As Gru tells the Minions he can no longer pay them for their services, the girls offer the contents of their piggy bank. Inspired, Gru sells parts of his lair and the items he stole over the years to construct a spacecraft. Gru plans to steal the Moon when it is nearest to the Earth, but this is ironically the same day as the girls' ballet recital. As Gru becomes puzzled, Dr. Nefario arranges for the girls to be returned to the orphanage, thinking the recital may ruin the plan. At the same time, Perkins informs his son - Vector - of Gru's possession of the shrink ray and the adoption of the three girls, encouraging Vector to take action.
</p><p>Gru successfully shrinks and steals the Moon. He rushes back to Earth to attend the recital, only to find a ransom note from Vector, who has kidnapped the girls. After arriving at Vector's base, Gru surrenders the Moon. However, Vector reneges on the deal, flying off with the girls and the Moon. Meanwhile, Dr. Nefario has discovered that the effects of the shrink ray are temporary. The bigger the object is, the faster it recovers its original size. Gru, Dr. Nefario, and the Minions execute a daring mid-air rescue of the girls, just before the Moon destroys Vector's spaceship and syncs itself back into orbit, along with Vector on it.
</p><p>Sometime later, Gru has returned the Great Pyramid and re-adopted the girls, writing them a bedtime storybook based on his own experience. The film ends with the girls performing their ballet recital for Gru, his mother Marlena, Dr. Nefario, and the Minions.

</p><p>Two years after Solomon Lane's capture,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Timeline_6-0"><a href="#cite_note-Timeline-6">[N 1]</a></sup> the remnants of his organization, The Syndicate, have reorganized as a rogue terrorist group called the Apostles. <a href="/wiki/Impossible_Missions_Force" title="Impossible Missions Force">IMF</a> agent <a href="/wiki/Ethan_Hunt" title="Ethan Hunt">Ethan Hunt</a> is assigned to buy three stolen <a href="/wiki/Pit_(nuclear_weapon)" title="Pit (nuclear weapon)">plutonium cores</a> in <a href="/wiki/Berlin" title="Berlin">Berlin</a> from Eastern European gangsters before the Apostles can. He is joined by <a href="/wiki/Benji_Dunn" title="Benji Dunn">Benji Dunn</a> and <a href="/wiki/Luther_Stickell" title="Luther Stickell">Luther Stickell</a> for the mission, but the team fails when Stickell is taken hostage and Hunt's attempt to save him allows the Apostles to make off with the plutonium. The team later captures nuclear weapons expert Nils Delbruuk, who designed nuclear bombs for the Apostles' client, an extremist named John Lark.
</p><p>Furious at the IMF's failure to secure the plutonium, <a href="/wiki/Director_of_the_Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Director of the Central Intelligence Agency">CIA Director</a> Erica Sloane instructs <a href="/wiki/Special_Activities_Division" title="Special Activities Division">Special Activities Division</a> operative August Walker to shadow Hunt as he attempts to retrieve the plutonium. Hunt and Walker infiltrate a nightclub party in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> where Lark is believed to be buying the cores from arms dealer Alanna Mitsopolis, also known as the White Widow, who acts as the middleman in the sale of the plutonium. They track a man whom they suspect to be Lark, but he is killed by <a href="/wiki/Secret_Intelligence_Service" title="Secret Intelligence Service">MI6</a> agent Ilsa Faust. Hunt sticks to his plan and assumes the role of Lark without a disguise and escapes from the hitmen sent to kill Lark and Mitsopolis.
</p><p>To secure the plutonium, Mitsopolis tasks Hunt with extracting Lane from an armoured convoy moving through Paris. She provides one of the plutonium cores as a down payment. With Mitsopolis and her brother intending to use lethal force on local police, Hunt and Walker preemptively attack the convoy. Ramming Lane's vehicle into water, they lead the police and Mitsopolis' men on a chase across Paris while Dunn and Stickell, in a watercraft, secure Lane. Faust reappears and attempts to kill Lane to prove her loyalty to MI6, but the extraction is successful. Mitsopolis instructs the team to deliver Lane and Faust to <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>.
</p><p>At a safe house in London, IMF Secretary Alan Hunley confronts Hunt, convinced he is the real John Lark. Hunley presents evidence which has been doctored by Walker and passed to Sloane, but Hunt denies it. Eventually, Hunt, the team, and Hunley trick Walker into admitting he is the real Lark and informs Sloane, who sends in a CIA unit to detain everyone. However, the CIA unit has been compromised by the Apostles, and Walker orders them to attack instead. Walker kills Hunley and escapes after Hunt chases him across the city. As he departs for Kashmir with Lane, Walker tells Hunt he knows the location of Hunt's estranged wife, Julia, and threatens her life should Hunt follow him.
</p><p>The team deduces that Lane and Walker plan to detonate the remaining bombs over the <a href="/wiki/Siachen_Glacier" title="Siachen Glacier">Siachen Glacier</a>, contaminating the water supply of <a href="/wiki/India" title="India">India</a>, <a href="/wiki/Pakistan" title="Pakistan">Pakistan</a>, and <a href="/wiki/China" title="China">China</a>; with a third of its population affected, the world will descend into an anarchy from which Lane and Walker hope a new world order will emerge. Upon arrival in Kashmir, Hunt discovers Julia and her new husband, Erik, are assigned to the medical camp, an arrangement made by Walker to increase the pressure on Hunt. Lane programs the bombs' detonator with a 15-minute countdown and hands over the detonator to Walker, choosing to remain behind with the two nuclear bombs; Walker then takes off in a helicopter, secretly pursued by Hunt while Dunn, Stickell, and Faust stay behind to find and defuse the nuclear weapons. Stickell works to deactivate the first bomb, and Julia volunteers her help, but they are unable to defuse it without the detonator. Dunn and Faust find the second bomb and subdue Lane. Following an <a href="/wiki/Dogfight" title="Dogfight">aerial chase</a>, Hunt uses a commandeered helicopter to ram Walker’s helicopter out of the sky, kills Walker by dropping the helicopter’s winch hook on him as they fight on a cliff, and secures the detonator, allowing Stickell, Faust, and Dunn to deactivate the bombs.
</p><p>In the aftermath, the remaining two cores are safely recovered. Sloane hands Lane over to MI6 through Mitsopolis, with Faust earning her exoneration from the organization as a result. Hunt recovers from his injuries with Julia's help, who tells him that he has given her the best life, despite his commitment to the IMF. Faust and the team join Hunt in celebration.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Impossible_Missions_Force" title="Impossible Missions Force">IMF</a> agent Trevor Hanaway is killed in <a href="/wiki/Budapest" title="Budapest">Budapest</a> by assassin Sabine Moreau, who takes his file containing Russian nuclear launch codes so she can give them to a man known only as "Cobalt".
</p><p>IMF agent <a href="/wiki/Ethan_Hunt" title="Ethan Hunt">Ethan Hunt</a> has purposely become incarcerated in a <a href="/wiki/Moscow" title="Moscow">Moscow</a> prison to acquire Bogdan, a source of information on Cobalt. With help of Jane Carter, Hanaway's handler, and newly promoted field agent <a href="/wiki/Benji_Dunn" title="Benji Dunn">Benji Dunn</a>, Hunt and Bogdan make their escape. IMF tasks Hunt to infiltrate the <a href="/wiki/Moscow_Kremlin" title="Moscow Kremlin">Kremlin</a> to gain more information on Cobalt. During the mission, an unknown entity broadcasts on the IMF frequency ordering the detonation of a bomb. Hunt's team aborts the mission just as a bomb destroys much of the Kremlin. Carter and Dunn escape, but Hunt is captured by <a href="/wiki/Foreign_Intelligence_Service_(Russia)" title="Foreign Intelligence Service (Russia)">SVR</a> agent Anatoly Sidorov and charged with destroying the Kremlin.
</p><p>Hunt escapes and meets with the IMF Secretary, in Moscow on other business. The Secretary tells Hunt they had to initiate "Ghost Protocol", disavowing IMF, but secretly orders Hunt to continue to pursue Cobalt. Sidorov's forces catch up to Hunt, and the Secretary is killed; Hunt escapes along with the Secretary's aide and intelligence analyst William Brandt. Regrouping with Carter and Dunn, Brandt is able to identify Cobalt as Kurt Hendricks, a Swedish-born Russian nuclear strategist, who seeks to start a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nuclear_war" title="Nuclear war">nuclear war</a> between the U.S. and Russia. Hendricks used the Kremlin bombing to cover up his theft of a Russian launch-control device, and now is planning a trade with Moreau at the <a href="/wiki/Burj_Khalifa" title="Burj Khalifa">Burj Khalifa</a> in <a href="/wiki/Dubai" title="Dubai">Dubai</a> to gain the required launch codes.
</p><p>The team travels to Dubai. On the 119th floor of the hotel, they create deceptions using their various gadgetry and disguises to make Moreau believe she is meeting with Hendricks, and vice versa, when in fact they are interacting with the IMF team. Moreau discovers the deception, and in the ensuing chaos, Hendricks manages to escape with the launch codes, losing Hunt's pursuit in the midst of a dust storm. As Moreau tries to escape, she is knocked out of a window by Carter and presumably falls to her death. Brandt accuses Carter of letting her love for Hanaway compromise the mission, but Hunt recognizes that Brandt has also been keeping secrets from them, having shown combat skills atypical of a mere analyst. Hunt leaves to meet with Bogdan to get more information on Hendricks, while Brandt tells the others that he had been assigned to secretly protect Ethan and his wife Julia in <a href="/wiki/Croatia" title="Croatia">Croatia</a>. Julia had been killed by a hit squad and Brandt feels responsible for Ethan's loss, which is why he stopped being a field agent.
</p><p>Bogdan directs Ethan towards <a href="/wiki/Mumbai" title="Mumbai">Mumbai</a>, where Hendricks is set to negotiate with Indian telecommunications entrepreneur Brij Nath to gain control of an obsolete Soviet military satellite. The IMF team splits up to stop Hendricks; Carter seduces Nath to get the satellite override code, while Hunt, Brandt and Dunn try to stop Hendricks from using Nath's broadcast station. They are too late as Hendricks has sent the launch codes to a Russian <a href="/wiki/Delta-class_submarine" title="Delta-class submarine"><i>Delta III</i>-class</a> <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_submarine" title="Nuclear submarine">nuclear submarine</a> to fire a single missile at <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> and disabled the station's computer systems. Brandt and Dunn race to get the systems back online to send the override code, while Hunt pursues Hendricks, eventually having a brutal brawl with him face to face in an automated car park. Hendricks, with the launch device, jumps to his death moments before the missile is set to land. Hunt then uses one of the cars and takes a dangerous fall to use the device; he barely disables the missile before it strikes. Sidorov, who has followed IMF from Dubai to Mumbai, arrives and realizes that the IMF is innocent of the Kremlin bombing.
</p><p>The team meets in <a href="/wiki/Seattle" title="Seattle">Seattle</a> after Ethan accepts a new mission from <a href="/wiki/Luther_Stickell" title="Luther Stickell">Luther Stickell</a>. Brandt confesses to Ethan about his failure to protect Julia. Ethan, however, reveals that her "death" and the murder of the Serbians were part of a plot to give her a new identity and enable Ethan to infiltrate the prison. A relieved Brandt happily accepts his mission, and becomes an agent once again. Meanwhile, Julia arrives at the harbor. Ethan and Julia gaze at each other from afar before Ethan departs for his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mission:_Impossible_-_Rogue_Nation" title="Mission: Impossible - Rogue Nation">next mission</a>.

IMF Field Operations Director William Brandt, knowing Hunley will try to capture Hunt, warns him to stay undercover. Cut off from the IMF, Hunt follows his only lead: the man in glasses, later identified as former MI6 agent Solomon Lane.
</p><p>Six months later, Hunt, still a fugitive living in <a href="/wiki/Paris" title="Paris">Paris</a> (luring a CIA team to a decoy safe house in <a href="/wiki/Havana" title="Havana">Havana</a>), enlists former colleague <a href="/wiki/Benji_Dunn" title="Benji Dunn">Benji Dunn</a> to attend the opera <i><a href="/wiki/Turandot" title="Turandot">Turandot</a></i> in the <a href="/wiki/Vienna" title="Vienna">Vienna</a> <a href="/wiki/Vienna_State_Opera" title="Vienna State Opera">state theater</a>, predicting that an assassination attempt will be made on the <a href="/wiki/Chancellor_of_Austria" title="Chancellor of Austria">Austrian Chancellor</a> at the performance, and that Lane will also be there. The two stop three snipers, including Faust, but the Chancellor is ultimately killed by a <a href="/wiki/Car_bomb" title="Car bomb">car bomb</a>, and Lane is still not found. Faust drops hints of Lane's plan to Hunt before leaving. After learning the Syndicate is working against "the old world order" by performing several terrorist acts, Dunn stays with Hunt instead of reporting back to the CIA, despite knowing his action amounts to treason.
</p><p>Hunt, blamed for the Chancellor's death, is pursued by the CIA's <a href="/wiki/Special_Activities_Division" title="Special Activities Division">Special Activities Division</a>. Brandt contacts <a href="/wiki/Luther_Stickell" title="Luther Stickell">Luther Stickell</a> to find Hunt before the CIA does. Stickell tracks Hunt, Dunn, and Faust to <a href="/wiki/Casablanca" title="Casablanca">Casablanca</a>, where they break into and acquire a secret Syndicate file from a secure building. Faust flees with the data, evading both Hunt and Syndicate members, although Hunt kills the pursuing agents. Dunn reveals he copied the data onto a second USB drive, as Stickell and Brandt catch up to them.
</p><p>Faust returns to London and attempts to use the file to quit her mission to infiltrate the Syndicate, but her MI6 <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Agent_handler" title="Agent handler">handler</a>, Atlee, compels her to continue, whilst discreetly wiping her drive. Meanwhile, Hunt learns that the data is an encrypted British government <a href="/wiki/Red_box_(government)" title="Red box (government)">red box</a> that requires the <a href="/wiki/Prime_Minister_of_the_United_Kingdom" title="Prime Minister of the United Kingdom">Prime Minister</a>'s biometrics to unlock it. They reach London, where Lane's men abduct Dunn, and use Dunn and Faust to <a href="/wiki/Blackmail" title="Blackmail">blackmail</a> Hunt into decrypting and delivering the data to them. Hunt agrees to the ultimatum, despite Brandt's protests.
</p><p>As part of Hunt's plan, Brandt reveals their location to Hunley. During a charity auction in <a href="/wiki/Blenheim_Palace" title="Blenheim Palace">Blenheim Palace</a> near <a href="/wiki/Oxford" title="Oxford">Oxford</a>, Hunley, Brandt, and Atlee take the PM to a secure room to protect him from Hunt. Brandt has the PM confirm the existence of the Syndicate, a project proposed by Atlee to perform missions without oversight, effectively making the PM "judge, jury and executioner with zero accountability", before Atlee reveals himself as Hunt in a mask and secures the PM's biometrics, allowing Stickell to decrypt the file. When the real Atlee arrives, Hunt forces him to admit that he began the Syndicate without permission and that he has been covering up its existence after Lane hijacked the project and went rogue, turning the Syndicate against him and MI6. Upon discovering the file contains access to <a href="/wiki/Pound_sterling" title="Pound sterling">£</a>2.4 billion in various bank accounts, serving as the Syndicate's would-be operating budget, Hunt destroys the data.
</p><p>At the meeting, outside the <a href="/wiki/Tower_of_London" title="Tower of London">Tower of London</a>, he tells Lane he memorized the data and offers himself in exchange for Dunn and Faust. Dunn escapes after the bomb on him is disarmed, while Hunt and Faust are chased through the Tower of London complex by Lane's men. Faust kills Vinter in a knife fight, while Hunt confronts Lane and lures him into a sealed, bulletproof glass cell where he is gassed unconscious and taken into custody. Having witnessed an IMF operation's success firsthand, Hunley later returns with Brandt to the Senate committee and convinces them to restore the IMF by covering for Hunt and his team. Outside after the meeting, Brandt congratulates Hunley, who is now the new IMF Secretary.
</p><p>Bio-chemical expert Dr. Vladimir Nekhorvich sends a message to the <a href="/wiki/Impossible_Missions_Force" title="Impossible Missions Force">IMF</a> for <a href="/wiki/Ethan_Hunt" title="Ethan Hunt">Ethan Hunt</a>, an old friend of his, warning that his employer, Biocyte Pharmaceuticals, forced him to develop a biological epidemic to profit from its remedy. He arranges to meet with Ethan to deliver the <a href="/wiki/Chimera_(virus)" title="Chimera (virus)">Chimera</a> virus, and its cure, <a href="/wiki/Bellerophon" title="Bellerophon">Bellerophon</a>. With Ethan on vacation and incommunicado, the IMF sends agent Sean Ambrose disguised as Ethan to meet Nekhorvich on a passenger plane. Ambrose goes rogue, killing Nekhorvich and stealing Bellerophon before his men destroy the plane.
</p><p>IMF Commander Swanbeck informs Ethan of the circumstances of Nekhorvich's death and they determine Ambrose is responsible. Swanbeck tasks Ethan with recovering the virus and its cure, and has him recruit Nyah Nordoff-Hall, a professional thief presently operating in <a href="/wiki/Seville" title="Seville">Seville</a>, <a href="/wiki/Spain" title="Spain">Spain</a>. After recruiting Nyah and romancing her, Ethan finds out that she is Ambrose's ex-girlfriend and he reluctantly convinces her to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Spy" title="Spy">spy</a> on Ambrose.
</p><p>Ethan assembles his team, computer expert Luther Stickell and pilot Billy Baird, in <a href="/wiki/Sydney" title="Sydney">Sydney</a>, <a href="/wiki/Australia" title="Australia">Australia</a>, where Biocyte laboratories are located and Ambrose is staying. As Ethan stakes out Biocyte, Nyah rekindles her former relationship with Ambrose and relays information to Ethan's team. At a <a href="/wiki/Horse_racing" title="Horse racing">horse racing</a> event, Ambrose meets with Biocyte's CEO, John C. McCloy. He shows McCloy a memory card video of Chimera affecting one of Nekhorvich's colleagues before blackmailing McCloy into cooperating with him. Nyah steals the camera's memory card and delivers it to Ethan. They learn that Chimera has a 20-hour dormant period before it causes death by mass destruction of the victim's <a href="/wiki/Red_blood_cell" title="Red blood cell">red blood cells</a>. Bellerophon can only save the victim if used within that 20-hour window. When Nyah discreetly returns the memory card to Ambrose, he notices it is in the wrong pocket of his jacket.
</p><p>Ethan's team kidnaps McCloy to force him to give up Bellerophon. However, the only Bellerophon samples were taken by Nekhorvich, and are now in Ambrose's hands. Ambrose has the cure, but does not have the virus; unbeknownst to him at the time, Nekhorvich injected himself with Chimera to smuggle it out of Biocyte. Ambrose plans to exchange a sample of Bellerophon to McCloy for a sample of Chimera. Ethan's team breaks into Biocyte to destroy the virus before the exchange can take place. Ambrose, posing as Ethan, tricks Nyah into revealing the plan, then captures Nyah and raids Biocyte to secure the virus. Ethan is able to destroy all but one sample of Chimera before Ambrose intervenes, and a firefight ensues, culminating in the sample being dropped on the floor between Ambrose and Ethan. Ambrose orders Nyah to retrieve the sample; she instead injects herself with it, preventing Ambrose from simply killing her after she retrieved it for him. Nyah insists that Ethan kill her to destroy the virus but Ethan is unwilling to do so. Ambrose takes Nyah away as Ethan escapes from the laboratory.
</p><p>Ambrose releases Nyah to wander the streets of Sydney in a daze, intending to start a <a href="/wiki/Pandemic" title="Pandemic">pandemic</a>. He offers to sell Bellerophon to McCloy in exchange for stock options, to make him Biocyte's majority shareholder. He predicts that the price of Biocyte's stock will skyrocket due to demand for Bellerophon after the Chimera outbreak. Ethan infiltrates the meeting and steals the remaining samples of Bellerophon. While Ethan is pursued by Ambrose and his men, Luther and Billy locate Nyah, who has wandered to a cliff side, intent on killing herself to prevent the eventual outbreak. Ethan kills Ambrose's men but Ambrose chases him to a beach where Ethan defeats him in a brutal fistfight. With little time left on the 20-hour countdown, Luther reaches Ethan at the beach. As Ethan is about to give Luther the Bellerophon canister, Ambrose recovers and points a gun at Ethan. Ethan throws the canister to Luther and jumps away from Ambrose's shot while kicking up a gun from the sand which he uses to finally kill Ambrose. Luther injects Nyah with the Bellerophon in time to cure her.
</p><p>IMF clears Nyah's criminal record and Ethan starts his vacation with her in Sydney.
</p><p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jim_Phelps" title="Jim Phelps">Jim Phelps</a> and his team, the <a href="/wiki/Impossible_Missions_Force" title="Impossible Missions Force">Impossible Missions Force</a> (IMF), are dispatched to stop the theft of the <a href="/wiki/Central_Intelligence_Agency" title="Central Intelligence Agency">CIA</a> <a href="/wiki/Non-official_cover" title="Non-official cover">non-official cover</a> (NOC) list from the American embassy in <a href="/wiki/Prague" title="Prague">Prague</a>. Their mission fails: the list is stolen, Phelps is shot, his wife Claire dies in a car bombing, and the rest of the team except <a href="/wiki/Ethan_Hunt" title="Ethan Hunt">Ethan Hunt</a> are eliminated by unknown assassins and supposed tech malfunctions. Meeting with IMF director Eugene Kittridge, Hunt reveals his awareness of a second IMF team sent to monitor them, and learns the job was a setup to lure out a mole within the IMF, who is believed to be working with an arms dealer known as "Max" as part of "Job 314." As Hunt is the only member left, Kittridge suspects him of being the mole, and Hunt flees.
</p><p>Returning to the Prague safe house, Hunt realizes "Job 314" refers to Bible verse <a href="/wiki/Book_of_Job" title="Book of Job">Job</a> 3:14, "Job" being the mole's code name. Claire arrives at the safe house, explaining she escaped the bomb after Phelps aborted the mission. Hunt arranges a meeting with Max, and warns her that she has been given a fake list on a disc equipped with a tracking device. He promises to deliver the real list in return for $10 million and Job's identity. Max and her agents escape, taking Hunt with them, just before a CIA team raids their location.
</p><p>Hunt and Claire recruit two disavowed IMF agents: computer expert <a href="/wiki/Luther_Stickell" title="Luther Stickell">Luther Stickell</a> and pilot Franz Krieger. They infiltrate <a href="/wiki/George_Bush_Center_for_Intelligence" title="George Bush Center for Intelligence">CIA headquarters</a> in <a href="/wiki/Langley,_Virginia" title="Langley, Virginia">Langley</a>, steal the real list, and flee to <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>. Kittridge, detecting the theft, has Hunt's mother and uncle falsely arrested for drug trafficking. He provides media coverage of the arrest, forcing Hunt to contact him from <a href="/wiki/Liverpool_Street_station" title="Liverpool Street station">Liverpool Street Station</a>. Hunt allows the CIA to trace him to London before hanging up, but is surprised to find Phelps nearby. Phelps recounts surviving the shooting, naming Kittridge as the mole. Hunt realizes Phelps is the mole, having stolen a Bible with a <a href="/wiki/Gideon" title="Gideon">Gideon</a> stamp from <a href="/wiki/Chicago" title="Chicago">Chicago</a>'s <a href="/wiki/Drake_Hotel_(Chicago)" title="Drake Hotel (Chicago)">Drake Hotel</a> during a previous assignment known to Hunt's team. Hunt also suspects Krieger as the one who killed the other IMF members in Prague, having recognized his distinctive knife; however, he is unsure whether Claire was involved. Hunt arranges with Max to exchange the list aboard the <a href="/wiki/TGV" title="TGV">TGV</a> train to Paris the next day and secretly sends tickets to Kittridge.
</p><p>On the train, Hunt remotely directs Max to the list. Max verifies it and directs Hunt to the baggage car, where he can find both the money and Job. Hunt calls Claire and tells her to meet him there. Meanwhile, Stickell uses a jamming device to prevent Max from uploading the data to her servers. Claire reaches the baggage car, finds Phelps and tells him Hunt will arrive shortly. She questions the idea of killing Hunt, since they will need a fall guy, but Phelps reveals himself to be Hunt in a mask, exposing her as a co-conspirator. When the real Phelps arrives and takes the money at gunpoint, Hunt dons a pair of video glasses that relays Phelps' image to Kittridge, blowing Phelps' cover as the mole.
</p><p>Phelps threatens to kill Hunt, but shoots Claire instead when she intervenes. He climbs to the roof of the train, where Krieger is waiting with a helicopter and a tether. Hunt connects the tether to the train itself, forcing the helicopter into the <a href="/wiki/Channel_Tunnel" title="Channel Tunnel">Channel Tunnel</a> after the train. Hunt places an explosive chewing gum on the helicopter windshield, killing Krieger and Phelps. Kittridge arrests Max and recovers the list, then reinstates Hunt and Stickell as IMF agents. Hunt is unsure about returning to the team, but on the flight home, an attendant uses a coded phrase to ask him if he is ready to take on a new mission.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Ethan_Hunt" title="Ethan Hunt">Ethan Hunt</a> has retired from field work for the IMF. He instead trains new recruits while settling down with his fiancée, Julia Meade, a nurse who is unaware of Ethan's true job. He is approached by fellow IMF agent John Musgrave about a mission to rescue one of Ethan's protégés, Lindsey Farris. Lindsey was captured while investigating arms dealer Owen Davian. Musgrave has already prepared a team for Ethan: Declan Gormley, Zhen Lei, and his old partner <a href="/wiki/Luther_Stickell" title="Luther Stickell">Luther Stickell</a>.
</p><p>The team rescues Lindsey and collects two damaged laptop computers. As they flee, Ethan discovers an explosive pellet implanted in Lindsey's head. Before he can disable it, it goes off and kills her. Back in the U.S., Ethan and Musgrave are reprimanded by IMF Director Theodore Brassel. Ethan learns that Lindsey mailed him a postcard before her capture and discovers a magnetic <a href="/wiki/Microdot" title="Microdot">microdot</a> under the stamp.
</p><p>IMF technician <a href="/wiki/Benji_Dunn" title="Benji Dunn">Benji Dunn</a> recovers enough data from the laptops to determine Davian will be in <a href="/wiki/Vatican_City" title="Vatican City">Vatican City</a> to obtain a mysterious object called the "Rabbit's Foot". Ethan plans a mission to capture Davian without seeking official approval. Before leaving, he and Julia have an impromptu wedding at the hospital's chapel. The team successfully infiltrates Vatican City and captures Davian.
</p><p>On the flight back to the U.S., Ethan threatens to drop Davian from the plane as he interrogates him about the Rabbit's Foot, but Davian refuses to reveal anything. After landing, Ethan learns that the microdot contains a video of Lindsey warning that Brassel is working with Davian. The convoy taking Davian across the <a href="/wiki/Chesapeake_Bay_Bridge%E2%80%93Tunnel" title="Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel">Chesapeake Bay Bridge–Tunnel</a> is attacked, and Davian escapes. Realizing Julia is in danger, Ethan races to Julia's workplace, only to find she has already been kidnapped. Davian calls Ethan and gives him 48 hours to recover the Rabbit's Foot in exchange for Julia's life. But before Ethan can do anything, he is captured by the IMF.
</p><p>Musgrave takes part in Ethan's interrogation but discreetly <a href="/wiki/Lip_reading" title="Lip reading">mouths</a> that the Rabbit's Foot is located in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shanghai,_China" title="Shanghai, China">Shanghai, China</a>, and provides Ethan with the means to escape. Ethan successfully escapes IMF headquarters shortly thereafter, resulting in him being declared an enemy of the state and placed on Interpol's most wanted list.
</p><p>Ethan then secretly travels to Shanghai where Declan Gormley, Zhen Lei, and Luther, sent by Musgrave under the guise of another operation, assist him in acquiring the Rabbit's Foot. As he delivers the Rabbit's Foot to the meeting point, Ethan is tranquilized. When he comes to, a micro-explosive is implanted in his head by one of Davian's henchmen. The restrained Ethan sees Davian holding Julia at gunpoint. Julia is bound to a chair and gagged with duct tape on her mouth. Despite Ethan asserting that he brought the real Rabbit's Foot, Davian shoots Julia and leaves.
</p><p>Musgrave arrives and explains that the woman killed was not Julia, but Davian's head of security disguised as Julia, executed for failing to protect him in Vatican City. The ruse was to confirm the authenticity of the Rabbit's Foot. Julia is alive and being held hostage. Musgrave reveals himself as the mole. He arranged for Davian to acquire the Rabbit's Foot and sell it to a terrorist group so that IMF would have reason to launch a preemptive strike.
</p><p>When Musgrave lets his guard down, Ethan manages to knock him unconscious. He frees himself and uses Musgrave's phone to track the last call's location to find Julia. With help from Benji on the phone, he locates the place, but encounters Davian and some of his henchmen. Ethan kills the henchmen, but Davian triggers the explosive in Ethan's head. Ethan fights him and manages to kill him. He comes back to free Julia, and then jury-rigs an impromptu defibrillator to deactivate the explosive. Before electrocuting himself, he kisses Julia and teaches her how to use his <a href="/wiki/Beretta_92" title="Beretta 92">Beretta 92</a> to defend herself. While Ethan is dead, Musgrave and a henchman arrive, and Julia is able to kill them. She successfully revives Ethan, and he explains his true IMF career to her.
</p><p>Back in the US, Ethan is congratulated by Brassel and his co-workers as he leaves for his honeymoon with Julia.
</p><p>Newlyweds <a href="/wiki/Shrek_(character)" title="Shrek (character)">Shrek</a> and <a href="/wiki/Princess_Fiona" title="Princess Fiona">Fiona</a> return from their honeymoon to find they have been invited by Fiona's parents to a royal ball to celebrate their marriage. Shrek refuses to go at first, but Fiona talks him into it, and along with <a href="/wiki/Donkey_(Shrek)" title="Donkey (Shrek)">Donkey</a>, they travel to the kingdom of Far Far Away. They meet Fiona's parents, King Harold and Queen Lillian, who are shocked to see both their daughter and son-in-law are ogres, with Harold particularly repulsed. At dinner, Shrek and Harold get into a heated argument over how Shrek and Fiona will raise their family, and Fiona, disgusted at Shrek and Harold's behavior, locks herself away in her room that evening. Shrek worries that he has lost his true love, particularly after finding her childhood diary and reading that she was once infatuated with Prince Charming.
</p><p>Harold is reprimanded by the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fairy_Godmother_(Shrek)" title="Fairy Godmother (Shrek)">Fairy Godmother</a> and her son Prince Charming by reminding him that Charming was to marry Fiona in exchange for his own happy ending. She implores him to find a way of getting rid of Shrek. Harold arranges for Shrek and Donkey to join him on a fictitious hunting trip, which is actually a trap to lure them into the hands of an assassin, <a href="/wiki/Puss_in_Boots_(Shrek)" title="Puss in Boots (Shrek)">Puss in Boots</a>. Unable to defeat Shrek, Puss reveals that he was paid by Harold and offers to come along and make amends. The three sneak into the Fairy Godmother's potion factory and steal a "Happily Ever After" potion that Shrek thinks will restore Fiona's love for him.
</p><p>Shrek and Donkey both drink the potion and fall into a deep sleep, awakening the next morning to discover its effects: Shrek is now a handsome man while Donkey has turned into an elegant white stallion. In order to make the change permanent, Shrek must kiss Fiona by midnight. Shrek, Donkey, and Puss return to the castle to discover that the potion has transformed Fiona back into her former human self as well. However, the Fairy Godmother, having discovered the potion's theft, intercepts Shrek and sends Charming to pose as him and win Fiona's love. At the Fairy Godmother's urging, Shrek leaves the castle, thinking that the best way to make Fiona happy is to let her go.
</p><p>To ensure that Fiona falls in love with Charming, the Fairy Godmother gives Harold a love potion to put into Fiona's tea. This exchange is overheard by Shrek, Donkey, and Puss, who are arrested by the royal guards and thrown into a dungeon. While the royal ball begins, several of Shrek's friends band together to free the trio with the help of The Muffin Man's monster-sized <a href="/wiki/Gingerbread_man" title="Gingerbread man">gingerbread man</a>, which breaks through the castle's defenses. Shrek is too late to prevent Charming from kissing Fiona, but instead of falling in love with Charming, Fiona knocks him out with a headbutt. Harold reveals that he never gave Fiona the love potion, whereupon the now-enraged Fairy Godmother attacks Shrek. In the ensuing melee, Harold sacrifices himself to save Shrek; his armor ricochets a spell cast by the Fairy Godmother which disintegrates her, and Harold is turned back into the <a href="/wiki/The_Frog_Prince" title="The Frog Prince">Frog Prince</a>, his true form. Harold gives his blessing to the marriage and apologizes for his earlier behavior, admitting his use of the Happily Ever After potion years earlier to gain Lillian's love, Lillian urges Harold that she loves him over his appearance.
</p><p>As the clock strikes midnight, Fiona rejects Shrek's offer to remain humans, and they happily let the potion's effects wear off and revert to their ogre forms, while Donkey changes back to his natural form as well. In the mid-credits scene, Dragon, who had previously romanced Donkey, reveals that they now have several dragon-donkey hybrid babies, much to his surprise.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Shrek_(character)" title="Shrek (character)">Shrek</a> and <a href="/wiki/Princess_Fiona" title="Princess Fiona">Princess Fiona</a> are to succeed the dying King Harold. Shrek's attempts to serve as the Regent during the King's medical leave end in disaster; Shrek insists that an ogre as king is a bad idea and that there must be someone else to rule the kingdom. Before he dies, Harold tells Shrek of another heir: his nephew, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Arthur_Pendragon_(Shrek)" title="Arthur Pendragon (Shrek)">Arthur "Artie" Pendragon</a>. Meanwhile, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Prince_Charming_(Shrek)" title="Prince Charming (Shrek)">Prince Charming</a> vows to himself that he will become King of Far Far Away and avenge the death of his mother, the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fairy_Godmother_(Shrek)" title="Fairy Godmother (Shrek)">Fairy Godmother</a>.

</p><p>Shrek, <a href="/wiki/Donkey_(Shrek)" title="Donkey (Shrek)">Donkey</a> and <a href="/wiki/Puss_in_Boots_(Shrek)" title="Puss in Boots (Shrek)">Puss in Boots</a> set out to retrieve Artie; as they are sailing away, Fiona reveals to Shrek that she is pregnant, much to Shrek's horror, as he believes he is not capable of raising children. The trio journey to Worcestershire Academy, an elite magical boarding school, where they discover Artie is a scrawny 16-year-old underachiever. At the school <a href="/wiki/Pep_rally" title="Pep rally">pep rally</a>, Shrek tells Artie he will be king of Far Far Away. Artie is excited until Donkey and Puss inadvertently frighten him by discussing the responsibilities of being king. Artie tries taking control of the ship to go back to Worcestershire and as he and Shrek fight over the wheel, it breaks and the ship crashes on a remote island, where they encounter Artie's retired wizard teacher, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Merlin_(Shrek)" title="Merlin (Shrek)">Merlin</a>.
</p><p>Charming and other villains attack the castle, but Wolfie, Pinocchio, Gingy, the Three Little Pigs and the Blind Mice stall them long enough for Fiona and her mother Queen Lillian to escape along with <a href="/wiki/Snow_White" title="Snow White">Snow White</a>, <a href="/wiki/Rapunzel" title="Rapunzel">Rapunzel</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cinderella_(Shrek)" title="Cinderella (Shrek)">Cinderella</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sleeping_Beauty" title="Sleeping Beauty">Sleeping Beauty</a>, and Doris the Ugly Stepsister. One of the Pigs accidentally blurts out that Shrek has gone to retrieve Arthur, and Prince Charming sends Captain Hook and his pirates to track down Shrek. The ladies are put in a tower after Rapunzel betrays them, having fallen in love with Charming.
</p><p>Captain Hook and his pirates track Shrek and his friends to Merlin's island, where they attempt to capture Shrek. Shrek and Artie defeat the villains, and Hook mentions Charming and the takeover of Far Far Away. Shrek urges Artie to return to Worcestershire. Instead, Artie cons Merlin into using his magic to send them to Far Far Away. The spell causes Puss and Donkey to accidentally switch bodies. They find Pinocchio and learn that Charming plans to kill Shrek as part of a play. Charming's men arrive, but Artie tricks the knights into not taking them into custody and they break into the castle during rehearsals for the play. Caught in Charming's dressing room, the four are taken captive.
</p><p>Charming prepares to kill Artie, believing he is the next king. To save Artie's life, Shrek tells Charming that Artie was a pawn to take his place as King of Far Far Away. Charming believes Shrek and allows Artie to leave. Donkey and Puss are imprisoned with Fiona and the ladies, where Fiona grows frustrated with their lack of initiative. Fiona's mother, Queen Lillian, smashes an opening in the stone wall of the prison with a headbutt. While the princesses launch a rescue mission for Shrek, Donkey and Puss free Gingy, Pinocchio, the wolf and pigs, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dragon_(Shrek)" title="Dragon (Shrek)">Dragon</a> and Donkey's children. They encounter Artie; Puss and Donkey mollify him by explaining that Shrek lied to save Artie's life.
</p><p>Charming stages a musical in front of the kingdom. Just as Charming is about to kill Shrek, Fiona, along with Puss, Donkey, the princesses and the fairy tale characters confront the villains. They lose, and Fiona is tied up. Artie shows up and convinces the villains that just because they are being treated like losers does not mean they must be losers. The villains agree to give up their evil ways. Charming refuses to listen, and lunges at Artie with his sword, but Shrek blocks the blow, so Charming attacks him instead. As Shrek pushes Charming aside, Dragon knocks over Rapunzel's tower, seemingly crushing him to death.
</p><p>Artie is crowned king. While the kingdom celebrates, Merlin restores Puss and Donkey to their correct bodies. Shrek and Fiona return to the swamp, becoming the parents of <a href="/wiki/List_of_Shrek_characters#Farkle,_Fergus,_&amp;_Felicia" title="List of Shrek characters">ogre triplets</a>, and coping with the help of Puss, Lillian, Donkey and Dragon.
</p><p>In a flashback, King Harold and Queen Lillian are about to sign the kingdom of Far Far Away over to Rumpelstiltskin, in exchange for lifting their daughter's curse. The deal is abruptly cancelled at the last second when a knight informs the King and Queen that <a href="/wiki/Princess_Fiona" title="Princess Fiona">Princess Fiona</a> has been rescued by <a href="/wiki/Shrek_(character)" title="Shrek (character)">Shrek</a>. An angry Rumpelstiltskin laments his loss and wishes Shrek was never born.
</p><p>In the present time, Shrek has grown steadily weary of being a family man and celebrity among the local villagers, leading him to wish for when he felt like a "real ogre" again. When he takes his family to Far Far Away to celebrate his children's first birthday, a series of mishaps further injure his ego, causing him to lose his temper and walk out in anger.
</p><p>Shrek encounters Rumpelstiltskin, who seizes his chance, having observed Shrek's angry outburst. He follows Shrek and arranges for him to appear to save his life. He gives Shrek a day to live like a real ogre, in exchange for a day from his childhood that he would not remember being erased to "thank" him.
</p><p>Shrek signs the contract and appears in an <a href="/wiki/Parallel_universes_in_fiction" title="Parallel universes in fiction">alternate reality</a> where the events starting from <a href="/wiki/Shrek" title="Shrek">Fiona's rescue</a> never happened. Now feared by the villagers, he takes the opportunity to cause some lighthearted mischief until he finds "WANTED" posters for Fiona and his home deserted and desolate. He is kidnapped by <a href="/wiki/Witchcraft" title="Witchcraft">witches</a> and taken to Rumpel, now the King of Far Far Away, which has become derelict and run down.
</p><p>Upon inquiry, Rumpel reveals that he took away the day Shrek was born. Therefore, Shrek never saved Fiona or met <a href="/wiki/Donkey_(Shrek)" title="Donkey (Shrek)">Donkey</a>, and consequently Rumpel was able to trick King Harold and Queen Lillian into signing their kingdom over to him, making them both disappear. When the day ends, Shrek will disappear as well as he was never born in this timeline. Shrek escapes Rumpel's castle with Donkey. Initially terrified of Shrek, Donkey decides to trust him after seeing Shrek cry over his erased history, something he had never seen an ogre do before. After Shrek explains the situation, Donkey helps him find a hidden exit clause: the contract can be nullified by "true love's kiss".
</p><p>They soon encounter an army of ogres who are resisting Rumpel. The ogres are led by a still-cursed Fiona who, after escaping from the tower where she was held captive, keeps the retired and overweight <a href="/wiki/Puss_in_Boots_(Shrek)" title="Puss in Boots (Shrek)">Puss in Boots</a> as a pet. Shrek does everything he can to gain Fiona's love, but she is too busy preparing an ambush on Rumpel. She is also bitterly cynical and disillusioned about the power of true love and throws herself into planning Rumpel's capture. While sparring with her, Fiona begins to take a liking for Shrek, but stops short of kissing him. Puss however, starts encouraging him to continue pursuing Fiona.
</p><p>During the ambush, the ogres are captured by the <a href="/wiki/Pied_Piper_of_Hamelin" title="Pied Piper of Hamelin">Pied Piper</a>, though Shrek and Fiona escape with the intervention of Puss and Donkey. Shrek insists Fiona kiss him, saying it will fix everything; however, because in this altered timeline Fiona does not truly love him, the kiss does not work. Before taking her leave, Fiona tells him love is just a fairy tale and she got herself out of the tower. When he hears that Rumpel is offering a wish to the one who brings him Shrek, Shrek turns himself in and uses the wish to free the other ogres, thus earning Fiona's respect and admiration. Afterwards, Rumpel reveals a captured Fiona whom he is going to feed to Dragon along with Shrek. Donkey leads the Ogre army to storm the castle, battle the witches, and capture Rumpel, while Shrek and Fiona trap Dragon.
</p><p>As the sun rises, Shrek begins to fade from existence, but Fiona, having fallen in love with him, kisses Shrek just before he disappears, restoring Shrek to his world just before he lashed out at the party. Shrek embraces his friends and family with a newfound appreciation for everything he has in his life.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Shrek_(character)" title="Shrek (character)">Shrek</a>, a mean and highly territorial green <a href="/wiki/Ogre" title="Ogre">ogre</a> who loves the solitude of his swamp, finds his life interrupted when countless fairytale creatures are exiled there by the fairytale-hating and vertically-challenged <a href="/wiki/Lord_Farquaad" title="Lord Farquaad">Lord Farquaad</a> of Duloc. Angered, he decides to ask Farquaad to exile them elsewhere. Shrek brings along a talking <a href="/wiki/Donkey_(Shrek)" title="Donkey (Shrek)">Donkey</a>, who is the only fairytale creature willing to guide him to Duloc.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Farquaad tortures the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gingerbread_Man_(Shrek)" title="Gingerbread Man (Shrek)">Gingerbread Man</a> for the location of the remaining fairytale creatures. His guards rush in with something he has been searching for: the Magic Mirror. He asks the Mirror if his kingdom is the fairest of them all but is told that he is not even a king, as he isn't descended from royalty. To become a king, he must marry a princess; Farquaad resolves to marry <a href="/wiki/Princess_Fiona" title="Princess Fiona">Princess Fiona</a>, who is locked in a castle tower guarded by a dragon. Unwilling to perform the task himself, he organizes a tournament wherein the winner gets the "privilege" of rescuing Fiona for him. Shrek and Donkey arrive during the tournament, and ignorantly defeat Farquaad's knights. Farquaad proclaims them the champions, and compels them under threat of death to rescue Fiona, promising to move the fairytale creatures from Shrek's swamp if he succeeds.
</p><p>Shrek and Donkey travel to the castle to find Fiona. They are noticed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dragon_(Shrek)" title="Dragon (Shrek)">Dragon</a>, who corners Donkey. In desperation, he sweet-talks the beast, learning that it is female. Dragon falls in love with Donkey and carries him to her chambers. Meanwhile, Shrek finds Fiona, who is appalled at his lack of romanticism and surprised he had not slain Dragon. They leave after rescuing Donkey, and Fiona is thrilled to be rescued but is quickly disappointed when Shrek reveals he is an ogre. Despite her demands that Farquaad come get her in person, Shrek forcibly carries her as he ventures back to Duloc with Donkey. The three encounter <a href='/wiki/List_of_Shrek_characters#"Monsieur"_Robin_Hood' title="List of Shrek characters">Robin Hood</a> on their way back, where it is revealed that Fiona is an expert martial artist. Shrek and Fiona find they have a lot in common and begin to fall in love.
</p><p>When the trio is almost at Duloc, Fiona takes shelter in a windmill for the evening. Donkey hears strange noises from within and investigates, finding Fiona transformed into an ogress. Fiona reveals that she was cursed during childhood to transform every night, and that only her true love's kiss will change her to "love's true form". Meanwhile, Shrek is about to confess his feelings to Fiona, but then overhears part of their conversation and becomes upset after mistaking her comment about being an "ugly beast" as disgust toward him. At Donkey's suggestion, Fiona vows to tell Shrek about her <a href="/wiki/Curse" title="Curse">curse</a>, but sees that Shrek has brought Lord Farquaad to the windmill. Confused and hurt by Shrek's sudden disposition towards her, Fiona accepts Farquaad's marriage proposal and requests they be married before nightfall. The couple return to Duloc, while Shrek angrily abandons Donkey and returns to his now-vacated swamp.
</p><p>Angered, Donkey arrives at the swamp and confronts a still upset Shrek. After a minor argument, Donkey tells Shrek that Fiona was talking about someone else, and urges him to go after her before she is married. They travel to Duloc quickly by riding Dragon, who had escaped her confines and followed Donkey.
</p><p>Shrek interrupts the wedding before Farquaad can kiss Fiona and tells her that Farquaad is not her true love and is only marrying her to become king. The sun sets, which turns Fiona into an ogress in front of everyone, causing a surprised Shrek to fully understand what he overheard. Outraged, Farquaad orders Shrek executed and Fiona detained.

They marry in the swamp and leave on their honeymoon.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Puss_in_Boots_(Shrek)" title="Puss in Boots (Shrek)">Puss in Boots</a> is a talking cat named for his signature pair of boots. Puss is a fugitive on the run from the law, looking to restore his lost honor. He learns that the outlaw couple Jack and Jill have the magic beans he has been looking for most of his life, which can lead him to a giant's castle holding valuable golden goose eggs. When Puss tries to steal them from the outlaws' room, a female cat named Kitty Softpaws interrupts, and both fail. Kitty is allied with Humpty Alexander Dumpty, a talking egg and Puss' long-estranged childhood friend from the orphanage where he was raised. Puss tells Kitty his <a href="/wiki/Origin_story" title="Origin story">origin story</a> and of his feelings of betrayal for a youthful misadventure when Humpty tricked Puss into helping commit a bank robbery in his hometown of San Ricardo; Puss has been on the run ever since. Humpty eventually convinces Puss to join them in finding the beans and retrieving the golden eggs.
</p><p>The trio steal the beans from Jack and Jill and plant them in the desert. Puss and Kitty's relationship becomes romantic. The trio ride the beanstalk into the clouds to find the castle of the late giant, while avoiding the Great Terror, a giant goose that guards the Golden Goose. When they realize the golden eggs are too heavy to carry, they steal the Goose, which is just a <a href="/wiki/Goose" title="Goose">gosling</a>, and escape the castle. While celebrating their victory, the group is ambushed by Jack and Jill, who knock Puss unconscious.
</p><p>When Puss wakes up, he tracks Jack and Jill to San Ricardo where he learns the entire heist was a plot by Humpty to lure him home to be arrested, as revenge for abandoning him to the authorities when Humpty's youthful heist went bad. Jack, Jill, and Kitty were involved in the con. After pleas from Imelda, his adoptive mother, Puss turns himself in to the guards while Humpty donates many golden eggs to the town and becomes a hero.
</p><p>While in prison, Puss meets the original Jack from "<a href="/wiki/Jack_and_the_Beanstalk" title="Jack and the Beanstalk">Jack and the Beanstalk</a>" who warns him that the Great Terror is in fact the Goose's mother, and it will stop at nothing to get its child back. Realizing Humpty intended to destroy the town all along, Puss lets a repentant Kitty help him break out of prison and she also tells him she loves him. Tracking him down just as the Great Terror arrives, Puss convinces Humpty to help him fight off the Great Terror, saying he knows Humpty is a good person at heart. Using the Goose as bait, Puss and Humpty lure the Great Terror out of the town. During the chase, Jack and Jill betray Humpty and try to take the Goose, but get crushed by the Great Terror. Humpty and the Goose are knocked off a bridge with Puss holding onto them. Humpty knows Puss cannot hold both of them, so he lets go, sacrificing himself to save the Goose and the town. Humpty's shell cracks open to reveal he was a golden egg on the inside. The Great Terror then takes the Goose and Humpty back to the giant's castle.
</p><p>Puss' efforts to save San Ricardo make him a hero among the townspeople and Imelda. In the epilogue, Jack and Jill are recovering from their injuries, Humpty is shown once again in his regular egg form, wearing a golden egg suit, as he rides the Great Terror into the clouds, and Puss and Kitty kiss.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Bella_Swan" title="Bella Swan">Bella</a>, who has just given birth, awakens from her human-to-vampire transformation and is introduced to her daughter <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Renesmee_Cullen" title="List of Twilight characters">Renesmee</a>. The rest of the Cullens and Jacob stay nearby, and when Jacob acts possessively towards Renesmee, Bella learns he has imprinted on her, making her furious until Jacob explains what imprinting is. Meanwhile, Bella's father, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Charlie_Swan" title="List of Twilight characters">Charlie</a>, has been trying to contact the Cullens for updates on Bella's health. Carlisle comes to believe that they have to leave <a href="/wiki/Forks,_Washington" title="Forks, Washington">Forks, Washington</a> to protect their identities - especially because of Charlie. Jacob, desperate not to lose Renesmee, visits Charlie and tell him that Bella is alive and well, but had to change in order to get better. Jacob also tells Charlie he doesn't live in the world he thinks he lives in, but says nothing about vampires. He then phases into his wolf form. Charlie then visits the Cullen house and meets Renesmee, believing she is a niece of Edward's whom Bella and Edward adopted. Afterward, the Cullens are able to stay in Forks.
</p><p>Several months pass with <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Carlisle_Cullen" title="List of Twilight characters">Carlisle</a> monitoring Renesmee's rapid growth. On an outing in the woods, a bitter <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Denali_coven" title="List of Twilight characters">Irina</a> sees Renesmee from a distance and assumes she's an <a href="/wiki/Immortality" title="Immortality">immortal</a> child without asking any questions. Immortal children were vampires who were changed in childhood, and because they could not be trained nor restrained, they destroyed entire villages. They were eventually executed, as were the parents who created them, and the creation of such children outlawed. Irina goes to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volturi" title="Volturi">Volturi</a> to report what she has seen. Alice sees the Volturi and Irina coming to kill the Cullens, and instructs the others to gather as many witnesses as they can to testify that Renesmee is not an immortal child. The Cullens begin to summon witnesses, such as the Denali family. One of the Denali, Eleazar, later discovers that Bella has a special ability: a powerful mental shield which had protected her from Edward's mind reading even when she was human, and which she is taught to extend to protect others from vampire powers.
</p><p>As some of their potential witnesses are attacked and prevented from supporting the Cullens, Carlisle and Edward realize they may have to fight the Volturi. Their witnesses ultimately agree to stand with them in battle, having realized the Volturi increased their Guard by falsely accusing covens of crimes, destroying them and then recruiting the vampires with gifts. The Volturi arrive prepared for battle, led by <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#The_Volturi" title="List of Twilight characters">Aro</a>, who is eager to obtain the gifted members of the Cullen coven as part of his Guard. Aro is allowed to touch Renesmee, and is convinced that she is not an immortal child. Irina is brought forth and takes full responsibility for her mistake, leading to her immediate death. Aro still insists that Renesmee may pose a risk in the future, validating his claim that battle is necessary. Before any violence, Alice shares with Aro her vision of the battle that is to come, during which both sides sustain heavy casualties, including Aro, who would also die. Aro believes her, giving Alice and Jasper an opportunity to reveal their witness, Nahuel (a half-mortal half-vampire just like Renesmee). The witness proves that he is not a threat, supporting the notion that Renesmee is not a threat. The Volturi unhappily leave, explaining that there will be no battle today.
</p><p>Back at the Cullen home, Alice glimpses the future, seeing Edward and Bella together with Jacob and a fully matured Renesmee also together. Edward reads Alice's mind and feels relieved that Renesmee has Jacob to protect her. Alone in the meadow, Bella pushes her mental shield away and finally allows Edward to see into her mind, showing him every moment she and Edward shared together and the two share a kiss after Bella telling Edward, "Nobody has ever loved anybody as much as I love you", and both Edward and Bella say they will love each other and be together forever.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Bella_Swan" title="Bella Swan">Bella Swan</a> is preparing for her wedding. During the reception, <a href="/wiki/Jacob_Black" title="Jacob Black">Jacob Black</a> who had angrily left town upon receiving an invitation to Bella and <a href="/wiki/Edward_Cullen" title="Edward Cullen">Edward Cullen</a>'s wedding, returns. While dancing with him in the woods, away from everyone else, Bella admits that she and Edward plan to <a href="/wiki/Consummation" title="Consummation">consummate</a> their marriage on their honeymoon while she is still human. Jake becomes furious, knowing that such an act could kill her. <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Sam_Uley" title="List of Twilight characters">Sam</a> and other pack members restrain Jacob before he phases.
</p><p>After the wedding, the couple spends their honeymoon on Isle Esme, and they make love for the first time. The next morning, Edward realizes that Bella has numerous bruises, and is upset at himself for hurting her, though Bella insists that she enjoyed the experience. Edward swears not to make love again until she becomes a vampire. Two weeks after the wedding, Bella notices her <a href="/wiki/Menstruation" title="Menstruation">period</a> is late. Alice and Carlisle call Bella asking if she is alright. She replied that she is not completely sure and tells them the news about her pregnancy. Edward, worried, predicts that Bella will not survive the pregnancy. He tells her that <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Carlisle_Cullen" title="List of Twilight characters">Carlisle</a> should remove the baby. She refuses, as she wants to keep her child, and convinces Edward's sister, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Rosalie_Hale" title="List of Twilight characters">Rosalie</a>, to act as her bodyguard. They fly back home to Forks, Washington. Though Bella has only been pregnant for two weeks, the baby grows very fast.
</p><p>Jacob rushes over to the Cullens' house. Bella, now heavily pregnant, is pale and underweight. Jacob, upset, says that they should abort it as soon as possible. Bella says that it is her choice. As her pregnancy progresses, the quality of her health declines, then, as she starts drinking human blood to satisfy the baby's vampiric thirst, improves rapidly. Edward comes to love the baby and manages to read its thoughts, learning that his child loves Bella and Edward's voice.
</p><p>Bella is sharing her baby names with Edward and Jacob, when her backbone suddenly breaks and she collapses. They realize that Bella cannot cope with the pregnancy and the baby is suffocating, so they begin to perform a <a href="/wiki/Caesarean_section" title="Caesarean section">cesarean section</a> on her. Rosalie starts the procedure, as Carlisle is out getting blood, but due to her hunger, the blood on the blade tempts her greatly. Jacob stops her as Edward picks up the blade and finishes the procedure. Bella, in agony, goes unconscious. After the surgery, Bella wakes up and sees her newborn daughter, and chooses Renesmee as the baby's name, before slowly dying. Jacob and Edward do everything they can to revive her, but nothing works. To save her life, Edward injects Bella's heart with his venom to transform her into a vampire, before biting her neck, arms and legs. Their attempts appear to fail. Jacob then runs outside of the house to sit and cry. Seth and Leah appear and realize that Bella will not survive and tell the pack. Distraught, Jacob goes back inside and attempts to kill Renesmee, but when they look into each other's eyes, he sees all the future versions of her and decides not to kill her, imprinting her instead.
</p><p>When the werewolves learn of Bella's "death", they attack the Cullens' house in an attempt to kill the baby, fearing it would become too great of a threat. Edward, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Alice_Cullen" title="List of Twilight characters">Alice</a>, and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Jasper_Hale" title="List of Twilight characters">Jasper</a>, defend their home with the help of Leah and Seth, and are later assisted by Carlisle, Esme, and Emmett. Jacob then runs outside to stop the fight and phases into his wolf form. Jacob and Sam shortly communicate with each other telepathically. Edward reads Jacob's mind, announcing that Jacob has imprinted on Renesmee, and since the wolves' most absolute law is not to harm anyone who has been imprinted on, they are forced to leave. 
</p><p>Bella is cleaned and dressed. Edward's venom begins to work in her body; her bite marks heal, her broken back and chest repair, and her figure returns to normal. When her eyes open, they are colored blood-red.
</p><p>In a <a href="/wiki/Post-credits_scene" title="Post-credits scene">post-credits scene</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Aro" title="List of Twilight characters">Aro</a> and his brothers, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Marcus" title="List of Twilight characters">Marcus</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Cauis" title="List of Twilight characters">Caius</a>, receive a letter from Carlisle announcing that the Cullens have a new member of the family. Aro informs his brothers that his feud with the Cullens is not yet over, as they have something he wants.
</p><p>On her eighteenth birthday, Bella Swan wakes up from a dream, in which she sees herself as an old woman. She expresses her distaste about growing older than her boyfriend, Edward Cullen, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vampire_(Twilight)" title="Vampire (Twilight)">vampire</a>, whose condition caused him to stop aging physically at seventeen. Despite her lack of enthusiasm, Edward's family host Bella a birthday party. While unwrapping a gift, Bella receives a paper cut. Edward's brother, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jasper_Hale" title="Jasper Hale">Jasper</a>, becomes overwhelmed by the scent of Bella's blood, and attempts to attack her, but is restrained and taken outside. During the incident, Edward pushes Bella to protect her, but she instead gets a big cut on her arm. Carlisle stitches Bella's cut on her arm. Believing that he and his family put Bella's life in danger, Edward ends their relationship, and the Cullens leave Forks.
</p><p>Edward's departure leaves Bella <a href="/wiki/Depression_(mood)" title="Depression (mood)">depressed</a> and <a href="/wiki/Social_isolation" title="Social isolation">isolated</a> for months. Unable to understand her erratic and despondent actions, her father, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Charlie_Swan_(Twilight)" title="Charlie Swan (Twilight)">Charlie</a>, wants to send Bella to live with her mother in <a href="/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida" title="Jacksonville, Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>, thinking it would be best for her, but Bella refuses and decides to spend more time with her school friends. After seeing a movie with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jessica_Stanley" title="Jessica Stanley">Jessica</a>, Bella sees a group of men on motorcycles. This reminds her of when Edward rescued her from a previous assault, and she sees his image. Bella discovers that any thrill-seeking activities she engages in will evoke Edward's preserved image. She is also comforted by <a href="/wiki/Jacob_Black" title="Jacob Black">Jacob Black</a>, a cheerful Quileute friend who helps to ease her pain over losing Edward. When Jacob suddenly begins avoiding her after getting angry at a movie theater and a rising body temperature, Bella visits him a few days later, and sees that he cut off his long hair and got the Quileute tattoo on his upper right arm. Bella eventually discovers that he, and others of his tribe, are shapeshifters who phase into wolves, and that they are an age-old enemy of vampires, particularly the Cullen family. Jacob's pack members are currently on alert for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Victoria_(Twilight)" title="Victoria (Twilight)">Victoria</a>, a vampire seeking to avenge the death of her mate, James, who was killed by Edward after James kidnapped and tried to kill Bella. They rescue Bella from Laurent when he tries to kill her. With Jacob busy coming to terms with his new shape-shifting powers, Bella again finds herself alone, and she returns to seeking thrill-inducing activities.
</p><p>Through a series of miscommunications, Edward believes that Bella has killed herself by jumping off a cliff into the ocean. Distraught, Edward travels to Italy and asks the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volturi" title="Volturi">Volturi</a> (powerful coven who act as vampiric overlords) to kill him, since he is incapable of ending his own life, but they refuse.  He then plans to force their hand by exposing himself as a vampire to humans. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alice_Cullen_(Twilight_character)" title="Alice Cullen (Twilight character)">Alice</a>, Edward's sister, is shocked that Bella is alive, and she also thought she saw Bella's funeral, which was really the funeral of Harry Clearwater after he died from a heart attack. Alice and Bella travel to Italy to save Edward, and arrive just in time to stop him. Alice looks on as Bella jumps into the sunlight, and into Edward, preventing him from being exposed as a vampire. Edward is relieved that Bella's alive and explains to her that he always loved her, and only left to protect her. He also promises never to leave Bella's side ever again. Impressed by Bella's willingness to sacrifice her life for Edward, the Volturi determine that Bella, a human who knows that vampires exist, must either be killed or transformed into a vampire herself. Alice stops them from killing her by sharing her vision, in which Bella and Edward are both vampires with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aro_(Twilight)" title="Aro (Twilight)">Aro</a>, a Volturi elder who is able to read thoughts through touch. Soon after, the Cullens return to Forks. Bella asks the Cullens to vote on her becoming a vampire, and only Edward and Rosalie say no. Later, Jacob reminds Edward of the treaty the Cullens and Quileutes made years before that the Quileutes will not attack if they don't bite humans, but Bella tells Jacob it's her choice. Jacob and Edward fight, and Jacob phases. Bella stops their fight and Jacob leaves. The movie concludes with Edward telling Bella that he will change her into a vampire once they are married.
</p><p>In Seattle, not far from Forks, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Victoria" title="List of Twilight characters">Victoria</a> still seeks vengeance on Bella for James’s death. Learning that Laurent is killed by wolves and to replace him and James, she attacks and bites <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Riley" title="List of Twilight characters">Riley Biers</a> in order to begin creating an army of newborns, who are many times stronger during their first few months than older vampires. Back in Forks, <a href="/wiki/Edward_Cullen" title="Edward Cullen">Edward Cullen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Bella_Swan" title="Bella Swan">Bella Swan</a> resume their relationship, and discuss the complications of becoming a vampire. At eighteen years old, one year older than Edward was when he became a vampire, Bella dislikes the idea of marrying so young, though Edward refuses to turn her into a vampire until they are married, his argument being that she should have a normal, human life. While Bella's father, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Charlie_Swan" title="List of Twilight characters">Charlie Swan</a>, investigates the disappearance of Riley Biers, Edward suspects his disappearance was caused by Victoria and her newborn's army, furthering his suspicions of Riley Biers' intrusion into Bella's bedroom to steal her red blouse.
</p><p>Bella insists that <a href="/wiki/Jacob_Black" title="Jacob Black">Jacob Black</a> and the rest of the wolf pack would never harm her. Bella wants to go to Jacob's home, even though Edward expresses his dislike of Jacob and concern for her safety, but she returns unharmed. During one of her visits, Jacob confesses that he is in love with Bella, and forcefully kisses her. Furious, she punches him and sprains her hand, and Edward later threatens Jacob and tells him to only kiss her if she asks him to. Bella even revokes the invitations of Jacob and his pack members to her graduation party at the Cullen house, but when Jacob apologizes for his behavior, she forgives him and lets him and the wolf pack attend the party.
</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Alice_Cullen" title="List of Twilight characters">Alice</a> sees a vision that the newborn army will attack Forks within the week, led by Riley Biers. Jacob, accompanied by <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Quil_Ateara" title="List of Twilight characters">Quil</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Embry_Call" title="List of Twilight characters">Embry</a>, overhear this, which leads to an alliance between the Cullens and wolf pack. Later, the Cullens and the wolves agree to a meeting place and time to train and discuss strategy against the powerful newborns. During their training <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Jasper" title="List of Twilight characters">Jasper</a> explains to Bella that he was a Major in the Confederate Army during the Civil War, and he was created by a vampire named Maria to control a newborn army. He eventually realized that Maria used him to fulfill her own ambitions. He didn't know there was another way until he met Alice and joined the Cullens. Bella sees the true bond between a mated vampire pair and begins to understand Jasper better. Despite her reluctance to marry young, Bella realizes that spending eternity with Edward is more important to her than anything else and accepts his marriage proposal, along with his late mother's engagement ring. Edward and Bella camp in the mountains to hide Bella from the bloodthirsty newborns. During the night, Bella overhears a conversation between Edward and Jacob, in which they temporarily put aside their hatred towards each other. In the morning, Jacob overhears Edward and Bella discussing their engagement and is furious. Bella desperately asks Jacob to kiss her, and she realizes that she loves him. Edward learns about the kiss but is not upset, because Bella says she loves him more than Jacob.
</p><p>When Victoria appears, Edward kills her while Seth kills Riley. The Cullens and the wolves, meanwhile, destroy her "army", though Jacob is injured saving Leah from a newborn. Several members of the vampire overlords, the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Volturi" title="List of Twilight characters">Volturi</a>, arrive to deal with the newborn army, and are surprised the Cullens weren't killed. They also see that the Cullens are guarding the newborn, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Twilight_characters#Bree_Tanner" title="List of Twilight characters">Bree Tanner</a>, who had refused to fight and surrendered to Carlisle. Jane briefly tortures Bree to get information, then has Felix kill her, despite the Cullens' efforts to spare her. Carlisle treats Jacob at his home, and Bella visits him to tell him that even though she loves him, she has chosen Edward. Devastated by her choice, Jacob reluctantly agrees not to come between her and Edward.
</p><p>Bella and Edward go to the meadow, where she tells him she has decided to do things his way: Get married, have a normal honeymoon, then be transformed into a vampire. She also explains that she never has been normal and never will be, that she's felt out of place her entire life, but when she is in Edward's world she feels stronger and complete. At the end of the story, they know they need to tell Charlie about their engagement, for which Bella is happy Edward is "bulletproof."

Believing that he and his family put Bella's life in danger, Edward ends their relationship, and the Cullens leave Forks.
</p><p>Edward's departure leaves Bella <a href="/wiki/Depression_(mood)" title="Depression (mood)">depressed</a> and <a href="/wiki/Social_isolation" title="Social isolation">isolated</a> for months. Unable to understand her erratic and despondent actions, her father, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Charlie_Swan_(Twilight)" title="Charlie Swan (Twilight)">Charlie</a>, wants to send Bella to live with her mother in <a href="/wiki/Jacksonville,_Florida" title="Jacksonville, Florida">Jacksonville, Florida</a>, thinking it would be best for her, but Bella refuses and decides to spend more time with her school friends. After seeing a movie with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jessica_Stanley" title="Jessica Stanley">Jessica</a>, Bella sees a group of men on motorcycles. This reminds her of when Edward rescued her from a previous assault, and she sees his image. Bella discovers that any thrill-seeking activities she engages in will evoke Edward's preserved image. She is also comforted by <a href="/wiki/Jacob_Black" title="Jacob Black">Jacob Black</a>, a cheerful Quileute friend who helps to ease her pain over losing Edward. When Jacob suddenly begins avoiding her after getting angry at a movie theater and a rising body temperature, Bella visits him a few days later, and sees that he cut off his long hair and got the Quileute tattoo on his upper right arm. Bella eventually discovers that he, and others of his tribe, are shapeshifters who phase into wolves, and that they are an age-old enemy of vampires, particularly the Cullen family. Jacob's pack members are currently on alert for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Victoria_(Twilight)" title="Victoria (Twilight)">Victoria</a>, a vampire seeking to avenge the death of her mate, James, who was killed by Edward after James kidnapped and tried to kill Bella. They rescue Bella from Laurent when he tries to kill her. With Jacob busy coming to terms with his new shape-shifting powers, Bella again finds herself alone, and she returns to seeking thrill-inducing activities.
</p><p>Through a series of miscommunications, Edward believes that Bella has killed herself by jumping off a cliff into the ocean. Distraught, Edward travels to Italy and asks the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Volturi" title="Volturi">Volturi</a> (powerful coven who act as vampiric overlords) to kill him, since he is incapable of ending his own life, but they refuse.  He then plans to force their hand by exposing himself as a vampire to humans. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alice_Cullen_(Twilight_character)" title="Alice Cullen (Twilight character)">Alice</a>, Edward's sister, is shocked that Bella is alive, and she also thought she saw Bella's funeral, which was really the funeral of Harry Clearwater after he died from a heart attack. Alice and Bella travel to Italy to save Edward, and arrive just in time to stop him. Alice looks on as Bella jumps into the sunlight, and into Edward, preventing him from being exposed as a vampire. Edward is relieved that Bella's alive and explains to her that he always loved her, and only left to protect her. He also promises never to leave Bella's side ever again. Impressed by Bella's willingness to sacrifice her life for Edward, the Volturi determine that Bella, a human who knows that vampires exist, must either be killed or transformed into a vampire herself. Alice stops them from killing her by sharing her vision, in which Bella and Edward are both vampires with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aro_(Twilight)" title="Aro (Twilight)">Aro</a>, a Volturi elder who is able to read thoughts through touch. Soon after, the Cullens return to Forks. Bella asks the Cullens to vote on her becoming a vampire, and only Edward and Rosalie say no. Later, Jacob reminds Edward of the treaty the Cullens and Quileutes made years before that the Quileutes will not attack if they don't bite humans, but Bella tells Jacob it's her choice. Jacob and Edward fight, and Jacob phases. Bella stops their fight and Jacob leaves. The movie concludes with Edward telling Bella that he will change her into a vampire once they are married.

Manny tells him to put them back, but Sid ignores Manny and looks after the eggs, which hatch into baby <i><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tyrannosaurus_rex" title="Tyrannosaurus rex">Tyrannosaurus rex</a></i> the next morning.
</p><p>Although Sid tries his best to raise the three dinosaurs, their rambunctious behavior scares away all the younger animals and ruins a playground Manny built for his child. Not long after, a female <i>Tyrannosaurus Rex</i>, whose eggs Sid stole, soon returns and carries both Sid and her young underground, with Diego in pursuit. Manny, Ellie, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ice_Age_characters#Crash_and_Eddie" title="List of Ice Age characters">Crash and Eddie</a> the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Opossums" title="Opossums">opossums</a> follow as well and discover that the icy cavern leads to a vast subterranean jungle populated by dinosaurs thought to be extinct. Here, an angry <i><a href="/wiki/Ankylosaurus" title="Ankylosaurus">Ankylosaurus</a></i> threatens The Herd despite Diego's efforts to fend it off; they are saved from a further crowd of angry reptiles by a deranged, quick witted, one-eyed <a href="/wiki/Weasel" title="Weasel">weasel</a> named <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ice_Age_characters#Buck" title="List of Ice Age characters">Buck</a>.
</p><p>Buck has been living in this jungle for quite some time and is fighting <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ice_Age_characters#Rudy" title="List of Ice Age characters">Rudy</a>, a huge <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Albino" title="Albino">albino</a> <i><a href="/wiki/Baryonyx" title="Baryonyx">Baryonyx</a></i>, intending to avenge the eye he lost to it when he was young with a knife he carved from one of Rudy's teeth. He agrees to lead The Herd through the jungle's perils to Lava Falls, where the dinosaur has taken Sid and her babies. In the meantime, Sid and the mother dinosaur try to outdo each other in feeding the offspring; he loses this contest, but is reluctantly welcomed into the family regardless. The next day, however, Sid is separated from the family and attacked by Rudy. Sid is knocked onto a loose rock slab that is floating on a river of lava and about to plummet over the falls.
</p><p>As The Herd moves toward Lava Falls, Ellie goes into labor and a <i><a href="/wiki/Guanlong" title="Guanlong">Guanlong</a></i> pack strikes, causing a rock slide that separates her from Manny and Diego. Manny doubles back to protect her and Diego fends off further attacks, while Buck takes Crash and Eddie ahead to rescue Sid. Just as he goes over the falls, the trio swoops in on a commandeered <i><a href="/wiki/Harpactognathus" title="Harpactognathus">Harpactognathus</a></i> only to be chased by a flock of <i><a href="/wiki/Pterodactylus" title="Pterodactylus">Pterodactylus</a></i> on the way and saves his life. Manny reaches Ellie just in time to hear the cry of a newborn baby girl. Manny initially wants to name the baby “Ellie” after her mother but Ellie suggests the name <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ice_Age_characters#Peaches" title="List of Ice Age characters">Peaches</a> after the fruit and the code name her and Manny agreed to use to signal when the baby is coming. Sid is saddened at the fact that he never had a chance to say goodbye to "his" children as he returns to The Herd and learns of Peaches' birth.
</p><p>Before they can leave the jungle, they are ambushed by Rudy, who begins to attack them at full force; working together Manny, Sid, Diego, and Buck manage to trap Rudy by ensnaring him in vines. However, he quickly breaks free and resumes his onslaught. The Herd is saved by the timely arrival of the mother dinosaur, who charges at Rudy and knocks him off a cliff. As she and her children wish Sid well, Buck, now without a purpose in life since Rudy is gone, decides to join The Herd and live on the surface. However, a distant roar tells him that Rudy is still alive; he changes his mind and sends The Herd home, blocking off the path to the underground jungle at the same time. Manny and Ellie welcome Peaches into their frozen world and admit that Sid did a good job looking after Momma's children. Diego decides to remain with The Herd, while Buck stays underground, happily battling it out with Rudy.
</p><p>While Scrat inadvertently causes the break up of <a href="/wiki/Pangaea" title="Pangaea">Pangaea</a>, Manny and Ellie are forced to deal with the trials and tribulations of their teenage daughter Peaches, who has trouble fitting in with her peers. Ellie tries to support her daughter, but Manny becomes exceedingly overprotective. Meanwhile, Sid's family returns, but only long enough to drop off the elderly Granny before abandoning them both. Shortly after, a sudden continental break-up separates Manny from The Herd. Trapped on a moving chunk of ice with Sid, Granny, and Diego, Manny has no choice but to ride out the current. Meanwhile, a giant land shift encroaches on Ellie, Peaches, and those remaining on land, causing them to make their way towards a <a href="/wiki/Land_bridge" title="Land bridge">land bridge</a>.
</p><p>Meanwhile, Scrat, in a subplot, finds an acorn that has a <a href="/wiki/Treasure_map" title="Treasure map">treasure map</a> on it that directs him towards an island. After violent weather pushes them further away from land, Manny's group is captured by a band of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Pirates" title="Pirates">pirates</a> sailing on a floating <a href="/wiki/Iceberg" title="Iceberg">iceberg</a> led by a <a href="/wiki/Gigantopithecus" title="Gigantopithecus">Gigantopithecus</a>, Captain Gutt, who attempts to press them into his crew. When they refuse, Gutt tries to execute them, leading to their escape, which inadvertently cause the ship and food supplies to sink. Gutt's <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/First_mate" title="First mate">first mate</a>, a female <a href="/wiki/Saber-toothed_cat" title="Saber-toothed cat">sabretooth</a> named Shira, joins them after she is left for dead.
</p><p>The Herd washes ashore on Switchback Cove, which gives a current back to their home. Manny coordinates a plan using a group of <a href="/wiki/Hyrax" title="Hyrax">hyrax</a> to steal a new iceberg ship that Gutt is planning to use, and they are able to escape using the ship. Just before that, Diego, who has fallen in love with Shira, tries to convince her to leave the pirates and join The Herd so she can have a better life, but Shira, while initially accepting, instead stays behind and slows Gutt down so The Herd can escape. Gutt then forms another ship and plans to seek revenge on Manny.
</p><p>After narrowly escaping a pack of <a href="/wiki/Siren_(mythology)" title="Siren (mythology)">sirens</a>, Manny, Sid, Diego, and Granny return home only to find the land bridge destroyed and that Gutt has beaten them and taken Ellie, Peaches, and the rest of The Herd hostage. A fight ensues, as Granny's pet whale, Precious, arrives and fends off Gutt's crew. Manny defeats Gutt in a final duel on an ice floe and reunites with his family and friends. Gutt subsequently encounters a siren that assumes the shape of a female Gigantopithecus, and is eaten alive. With their home destroyed by the land shift, Precious takes the entire Herd (including Shira, who becomes a couple with Diego) to a lush island where the hyraxes from earlier have already started rebuilding their civilization.
</p><p>In the film's <a href="/wiki/Epilogue" title="Epilogue">epilogue</a>, Scrat discovers the island on the map, known as Scratlantis (a parody of <a href="/wiki/Atlantis" title="Atlantis">Atlantis</a>), but his uncontrollable urge to hunt acorns in the acorn-rich city inadvertently causes the entire island to sink when he unplugs an acorn drain holder; Scrat is then ejected into a newly created desert landscape, through which he screams as his tears boil from the heat.
</p><p>Manny, Sid, and Diego are currently living in a large valley surrounded by an enormously high ice wall on all sides. However, the trio discovers that the ice wall is actually a dam that is barely holding a massive body of water that could flood the valley to nearly a mile underwater. A vulture tells them that there is a boat at the other end of the valley that may save them all, but they only have three days to reach it or die. Manny is also having trouble fearing the fact that he may be the last mammoth left.
</p><p>During the evacuation, a glacier that contains two sea reptiles from the <a href="/wiki/Mesozoic" title="Mesozoic">Mesozoic</a> era, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Cretaceous_(Ice_Age)" title="Cretaceous (Ice Age)">Cretaceous</a> a <i><a href="/wiki/Cymbospondylus" title="Cymbospondylus">Cymbospondylus</a></i> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Maelstrom_(Ice_Age)" title="Maelstrom (Ice Age)">Maelstrom</a> a <i><a href="/wiki/Pliosauroidea" title="Pliosauroidea">Pliosauroidea</a></i>, breaks off. When Manny is briefly separated from them, Diego and Sid encounter two mischievous <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Opossums" title="Opossums">opossums</a> named <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_characters#Crash_and_Eddie" title="List of characters">Crash and Eddie</a> who drive them nuts by playing <a href="/wiki/Whac-A-Mole" title="Whac-A-Mole">Whac-A-Mole</a> with them. Manny is still worried about being the <a href="/wiki/Endling" title="Endling">last</a> <a href="/wiki/Mammoth" title="Mammoth">mammoth</a> alive and his family, who had been killed by humans, but is surprised when he encounters <a href="/wiki/List_of_Ice_Age_characters#Ellie" title="List of Ice Age characters">Ellie</a>, a female woolly mammoth who believes she is an <a href="/wiki/Opossum" title="Opossum">opossum</a> and Crash and Eddie's adoptive sister. Sid invites her to tag along with the group to escape the flood, and she brings her brothers. After a dangerous encounter with Cretaceous and Maelstrom while crossing a pond, Sid prompts Diego to encourage him to admit and face his fears - Diego insists that "fear is for prey", so Sid points out that Diego is behaving as if he is the water's prey. They discover an area which Ellie recalls as the place where she was adopted. She finally realizes she is a mammoth and also expresses her suspicions about how different she was from other opossums. Despite this bonding moment with Manny, she distances herself from him when he suggests "saving their species".  Ellie and Manny ultimately make up when they must co-operate to save the group when the ground cracks under their feet. Sid is kidnapped by a tribe of mini-sloths who believe Sid to be a god. Sid lights a fire for them, and believes that he has finally found respect, but they plan to sacrifice him by tossing him into a <a href="/wiki/Volcano" title="Volcano">volcano</a>; Sid narrowly escapes. The next morning, Sid tells the others his experience but none are convinced. After being harassed by vultures, the group finds the boat behind a field of hot geysers, which separates Manny, Sid and Diego from Ellie and her brothers when they argue about which way's safest to go through.
</p><p>When the flood comes, Manny saves Ellie from drowning as she is caught in a cave (due to falling rocks), while Diego overcomes his <a href="/wiki/Aquaphobia" title="Aquaphobia">fear of water</a> to save Sid, Crash and Eddie from drowning.  Cretaceous and Maelstrom arrive, but due to Manny's quick thinking, they are finished off by a rock which falls on them, killing them both. The other animals are at the mercy of the water currents. Meanwhile, Scrat climbs up the glacier and at the top sticks the acorn he has into the ice. This forms a crack in the glacier, which widens into a <a href="/wiki/Fissure" title="Fissure">fissure</a>, diverting the flood and saving the animals in the valley; Scrat is then washed away. In the final scene, a herd of mammoths show up, proving mammoths aren't extinct. But Manny and Ellie decide to remain together anyway, taking Sid, Diego and the <a href="/wiki/Opossum" title="Opossum">opossum</a> brothers along. Sid encounters the mini-sloths again - they believe Sid stopped the flood and invite him to be their leader.  Diego, surprised to see the mini-sloths are real, convinces Sid to stay with the others, admitting that Sid is a vital part of their 'herd'.
</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Epilogue" title="Epilogue">epilogue</a> shows Scrat having a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Near_death_experience" title="Near death experience">near death experience</a> after falling into the fissure. He enters a <a href="/wiki/Heaven" title="Heaven">heaven</a> full of acorns. Suddenly, he finds himself torn away. He unhappily wakes up, having been resuscitated by Sid, who he proceeds to viciously attack.
</p><p>Scrat is once again trying to bury his acorn but accidentally activates an abandoned alien ship that takes him into deep space, where he unwittingly sends several <a href="/wiki/Asteroid" title="Asteroid">asteroids</a> en route to a collision with Earth. Meanwhile, Manny and Ellie are preparing upcoming marriage between Peaches and her fiancé, Julian. Diego and his wife Shira want to start a family, but their fierce appearance tends to scare kids. Sid is dumped by his girlfriend, Francine, just as he is about to propose to her, and he laments his solitude. During Manny and Ellie's wedding anniversary party, some of the asteroids strike the place and The Herd barely escape. Meanwhile, at <a href="/wiki/Ice_Age:_Dawn_of_the_Dinosaurs" title="Ice Age: Dawn of the Dinosaurs">the underground lost world</a>, Buck returns a dinosaur egg back to its rightful owner after it was stolen by a trio of flying <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dromaeosaurs" title="Dromaeosaurs">dromaeosaurs</a><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-TheHuffPostReview_8-0"><a href="#cite_note-TheHuffPostReview-8">[8]</a></sup> named Gavin, Gertie, and Roger. Buck discovers an ancient stone pillar and takes it to the surface, where he meets Manny and the others.
</p><p>Buck explains to The Herd that according to the pillar, the asteroids had caused several extinctions in the past and with a massive one still incoming, he believes that the only place they could find a clue to stop it is on the site of the impact of the previous ones, as according to its engravings, they always fall at the same place. However, the three dromaeosaurs overhear their conversation, and Gavin and Gertie decide to stop them, believing that they could easily avoid the impact, thus not only getting their revenge on Buck, but also killing all mammals and securing domination over Earth for their species. Roger is reluctant, but Gavin and Gertie strong-arm him into cooperating.
</p><p>As The Herd travels to the crash site, they discover that the asteroids have electro-magnetic properties. Buck theorizes that if a huge quantity of smaller asteroids should be gathered and launched into orbit, they could attract the main asteroid as well and prevent it from falling on Earth. After facing several obstacles and the interference of the dromaeosaurs, The Herd arrives at "Geotopia", a community of immortal animals formed inside one of the asteroids that have fallen long ago, where Sid meets Brooke, a female ground sloth who falls in love with him. However, Shangri Llama, the leader of Geotopia, refuses to cooperate with Buck's plan to send the city's crystals into space in order to prevent the imminent impact, as they are the key to the residents' longevity. Sid inadvertently destroys the entire city when he attempts to remove one of the crystals to present Brooke with,  immediately aging them to their real ages and revealing their true crone-like appearances.
</p><p>Once Brooke convinces the Geotopians that preventing the asteroid's fall is more important than their lost youth, they and The Herd help with Buck's plan, which is to fill up a geyser with the crystals so that the pressure launches them into space to draw the asteroid away. The dromaeosaurs attempt to intervene, but Buck convinces Roger that they will not be able to survive the asteroid, and he in turn convinces Gavin and Gertie to help. The plan works, and the asteroid is pulled back into space. The Herd then departs back home, including Sid, who parts ways from Brooke, but just after they leave, an asteroid piece falls inside a hot spring, giving it rejuvenating properties and making the Geotopians and Sid's grandmother, who stayed behind with them, regain their youth. After The Herd returns, Manny reconciles with Julian, Peaches and Julian celebrate their wedding, Diego and Shira become heroes to the kids who were scared of them before, and a rejuvenated Brooke appears during the ceremony to reunite with Sid.
</p><p>In the film's epilogue, Scrat keeps struggling to control the alien ship until it crashes on <a href="/wiki/Mars" title="Mars">Mars</a>, destroying all life on the planet.
</p><p>In a mid-credits scene, Scrat finds his acorn, but gets beaten by some doors.
</p><p>A saber-toothed squirrel known as Scrat attempts to find a place to store his acorn for the winter. Eventually, as he tries to stomp it into the ground, he inadvertently causes a large crack to form in the ice that extends for miles before setting off a large avalanche which nearly crushes him. He barely escapes, but finds himself getting stepped on by a herd of prehistoric animals migrating south in order to escape the forthcoming <a href="/wiki/Ice_age" title="Ice age">ice age</a>. Sid, a clumsy <a href="/wiki/Ground_sloth" title="Ground sloth">ground sloth</a>, is left behind by his family and decides to move on by himself, but is attacked by two prehistoric rhinos after ruining their meal and making them angry. Sid is soon rescued by Manny, a gruff <a href="/wiki/Woolly_mammoth" title="Woolly mammoth">woolly mammoth</a> heading north, who fights the rhinos off and continues on his path. Sid joins Manny, not wanting to be alone and unprotected. Manny is annoyed by Sid's outgoing demeanor and wishes to migrate on his own, but Sid nonetheless continues to follow Manny. Meanwhile, Soto, the leader of a pack of <a href="/wiki/Smilodon" title="Smilodon">saber-toothed tigers</a>, wants revenge on a group of humans for killing half of his pack, by eating the chief's infant son, Roshan,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Strong_Official_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-Strong_Official-2">[2]</a></sup> alive. Soto leads a raid on the human camp, during which the baby's mother is separated from everyone else and jumps down a waterfall upon being cornered by Soto's lieutenant, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Diego_(Ice_Age)" title="Diego (Ice Age)">Diego</a>. As punishment for his failure to retrieve the baby, Diego is sent to find and retrieve the baby.
</p><p>Later, Sid and Manny encounter the baby and his mother near the lake, having survived her plunge. The mother only has enough strength to entrust her baby to Manny before she disappears into the water. After much persuasion by Sid, they decide to return the baby, but when they reach the human settlement, they find it deserted. They meet up with Diego, who convinces the pair to let him help by tracking the humans. The four travel on, with Diego secretly leading them to half-peak where his pack is waiting to ambush them.
</p><p>After encountering several misadventures on their way, the group reaches a cave with several <a href="/wiki/Cave_painting" title="Cave painting">cave paintings</a> made by humans. There, Sid and Diego learn about Manny's past and his previous interactions with the human hunters, in which his wife and child were killed, leaving Manny a loner. Later, Manny, Sid, Diego and the baby almost reach their destination, Half-Peak, only to encounter a river of lava. Manny and Sid, along with the baby, make it across safely, but Diego freezes, about to fall into the lava. Manny saves him, narrowly missing certain death by falling into the lava himself. The herd takes a break for the night, and the baby takes his first walking steps towards Diego, who starts to have a change of heart about his mission.
</p><p>The next day, the herd approaches the ambush, causing Diego, now full of respect for Manny for saving his life to change his mind and confess to Manny and Sid about the ambush. As the pair turn hostile towards him, Diego asks for their trust, and tries to foil the attack. The herd battles Soto's pack, but despite their efforts, Soto's associates manage to corner Manny. As Soto closes in for the kill on Manny, Diego sacrifices himself by jumping in the way and is injured as a result. Manny then knocks a distracted Soto into a rock wall, causing several sharp icicles to fall onto Soto, killing him. Horrified, the rest of the pack retreat. Manny and Sid mourn for Diego's injury, which they believe is fatal, and continue their journey without him. The two manage to successfully return the baby to his tribe, and to their surprise, Diego manages to rejoin them, in time to see the baby leave. The group then begin to head off to warmer climates.
</p><p>20,000 years later, Scrat, frozen in a block of ice, ends up on the shores of a tropical island. As the ice slowly melts, an acorn that was also frozen in the same ice block is washed away. Scrat then finds a coconut and tries stomp it into the ground, only to mistakenly trigger a volcanic eruption.
</p><p>After the 74th Hunger Games, <a href="/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen" title="Katniss Everdeen">Katniss Everdeen</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peeta_Mellark" title="Peeta Mellark">Peeta Mellark</a> return to <a href="/wiki/Fictional_world_of_The_Hunger_Games#District_12" title="Fictional world of The Hunger Games">District 12</a>, where President Snow visits Katniss. Snow explains that her actions in the Games have inspired uprisings. He orders her to use the upcoming Victory Tour to convince people that her actions were out of love for Peeta and not defiance against the Capitol, or District 12 will be destroyed, "just like <a href="/wiki/Fictional_world_of_The_Hunger_Games#District_13" title="Fictional world of The Hunger Games">District 13</a>". He makes Katniss promise that the two will not lie to each other.
</p><p>As the tour begins, Haymitch Abernathy warns Katniss and Peeta that the show of their relationship must continue for the rest of their lives. Katniss suggests they announce their <a href="/wiki/Engagement" title="Engagement">engagement</a>, which is approved by Snow, with their wedding to be staged at his mansion in the Capitol.
</p><p>Katniss warns Gale, her neighbour and friend, of Snow's threat. Peacekeepers crack down on District 12, and Gale is publicly whipped after attacking the Head Peacekeeper, Romulus Thread. Snow announces that the third Quarter Quell of the upcoming Hunger Games will involve tributes selected from previous victors, guaranteeing that Katniss will be selected as she is the only living female victor from District 12. Katniss immediately devotes herself to ensuring Peeta's survival, and makes Haymitch promise to help. At the reaping, <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Hunger_Games_characters" title="List of The Hunger Games characters">Effie Trinket</a> draws Katniss's and Haymitch's names, but Peeta immediately volunteers to take Haymitch's place.
</p><p>Haymitch reveals that the tributes are angry about being returned to the Games, and all of them will most likely attempt to stop the games. For her pre-Games interview, Katniss wears a wedding dress, as ordered by Snow, but her stylist Cinna sets it to transform into a representation of a <a href="/wiki/Mockingjay" title="Mockingjay">mockingjay</a>. Peeta announces on-air that he and Katniss secretly married and are expecting a child. The audience of Capitol citizens protests and shouts for the Games to be stopped, to no avail. Just before Katniss enters the arena, Cinna is severely beaten by Peacekeepers in front of her, then dragged away.
</p><p>In the Games, Katniss allies with Finnick Odair and the elderly Mags, his mentor. When the arena's force field shocks Peeta, stopping his heart, Finnick revives him. The group flees from a <a href="/wiki/Blister_agent" title="Blister agent">poisonous fog</a>, with Finnick carrying Mags, but when Peeta cannot go on, Mags sacrifices herself so that Finnick can help him. When <a href="/wiki/Mandrill" title="Mandrill">mandrills</a> attack, Peeta is saved by the unexpected sacrifice of a hiding tribute, the female from District 6. The group escapes to the beach around the central lake, where Finnick greets District 3's Wiress and Beetee and District 7's Johanna Mason. Wiress repeats the phrase "tick-tock", leading Katniss to realize that the arena is designed like a clock, with unchanging hazards each hour contained within their respective zones on the clock. As the team waits for the next danger, Wiress is stabbed to death by Gloss, who alongside his sister Cashmere, and District 2 tributes Brutus and Enobaria, comprise the Careers. Gloss is immediately fatally shot by Katniss while Johanna kills Cashmere with her axe. Finnick is injured by Enobaria's knife, and after the Gamemakers spin the clock to disorient the tributes, they quickly leave the beach for the woods.
</p><p>Beetee suggests luring the Careers to the wet beach and electrocuting them by running his wire to the lake from a tree that is struck by lightning every 12 hours, having won his games by doing so, killing six tributes at once. The group separates to prepare the trap, Finnick and Peeta protecting Beetee, and Katniss running the wire down to the beach with Johanna. While pulling the coil, an unknown source of tension makes it apparent another tribute is on their tail. When Brutus and Enobaria emerge, Johanna knocks Katniss to the ground, cuts the tracker out of her arm, and flees. Katniss returns to the tree and finds an unconscious Beetee. Unable to recover Peeta, and hearing a cannon (which was Peeta killing Brutus), Katniss almost kills Finnick, thinking he broke the alliance and attacked Peeta, but he reminds her to remember who "the real enemy" is, as Haymitch had advised her before the games. Katniss attaches the wire to an arrow and shoots it into the arena's roof just as the lightning hits. The lightning strike paralyzes Katniss and incapacitates Finnick, causing a power failure that brings down the dome and disables the security cameras inside the arena, preventing the Capitol from observing the events.
</p><p>Katniss awakens in a hovercraft with Beetee, who is still unconscious. She finds Haymitch, Finnick, and Plutarch Heavensbee, the new head Gamemaker, who is revealed to be a rebel against Snow. He tells her they are bound for District 13, headquarters of the rebellion, and that half the tributes (the ones from 3, 4, 6, 7, 8 and 11) were recruited to help Katniss escape, as she is the symbol of the growing rebellion. They were unable to rescue Peeta and Johanna, and they are captives in the Capitol. Katniss is sedated after attacking Haymitch for not keeping his promise to protect Peeta. She later awakens to find Gale by her side. He assures her that her family is safe, but that District 12 has been destroyed after Snow was made aware of the rebels' plot.
</p><p>After being rescued from the destroyed arena in the 75th Hunger Games, tributes <a href="/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen" title="Katniss Everdeen">Katniss Everdeen</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Hunger_Games_characters#Beetee" title="List of The Hunger Games characters">Beetee</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Finnick_Odair" title="Finnick Odair">Finnick Odair</a> are taken to District 13, a below-ground district isolated from Panem that has been spearheading the rebellion. Katniss is reunited with <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Hunger_Games_characters#Mrs._Everdeen" title="List of The Hunger Games characters">her mother</a> and sister <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Primrose_Everdeen" title="Primrose Everdeen">Prim</a>. Katniss is introduced to <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Hunger_Games_characters#President_Coin" title="List of The Hunger Games characters">President Alma Coin</a>, the rebel leader, and is told that her arrow  destroying the force field led to riots erupting in over half the districts, joining 13 in the rebel cause, though it also caused Snow to firebomb District 12 in retaliation. Coin asks her to become the "Mockingjay" – symbol of the rebellion – as part of a "<a href="/wiki/Winning_hearts_and_minds" title="Winning hearts and minds">hearts and minds</a>" strategy. Katniss reluctantly agrees after seeing Peeta being manipulated on Capitol state television to quell the rebellion, though she first gets <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Plutarch_Heavensbee" title="Plutarch Heavensbee">Plutarch Heavensbee</a> to help make Coin agree to rescue and pardon Peeta at the earliest opportunity.
</p><p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Haymitch_Abernathy" title="Haymitch Abernathy">Haymitch</a> helps Katniss maintain her spontaneity when she meets her film team (led by Capitol escapee <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Hunger_Games_characters#Cressida" title="List of The Hunger Games characters">Cressida</a>), and is given <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Effie_Trinket" title="Effie Trinket">Effie Trinket</a> as a stylist and close friend <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gale_Hawthorne" title="Gale Hawthorne">Gale</a> as a bodyguard. They go to District 8 to visit a hospital, but as the visit concludes, a Capitol air squadron bombs the hospital. The crew film Katniss and Gale shooting down two Capitol hovercrafts, then Katniss’ rage-filled threat to the Capitol that "If we burn, you burn with us." Beetee hijacks the Capitol's news feed and broadcasts the footage, after which lumberjacks in District 7 revolt, shout the same phrase and kill numerous Peacekeepers.
</p><p>Katniss and her team travel to District 12, where Gale recounts the day it was destroyed; Katniss is filmed singing "<a href="/wiki/The_Hanging_Tree_(The_Hunger_Games_song)" title="The Hanging Tree (The Hunger Games song)">The Hanging Tree</a>". Soon after, hundreds of protesters in District 5, singing the same anthem, launch a suicidal <a href="/wiki/Human_wave_attack" title="Human wave attack">human wave attack</a> against a <a href="/wiki/Hydroelectricity" title="Hydroelectricity">hydroelectric dam</a> that is the Capitol's primary source of electricity. The attack destroys the dam, forcing the Capitol to revert to secondary generators.
</p><p>That night, Katniss watches Peeta being interviewed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Caesar_Flickerman" title="Caesar Flickerman">Caesar Flickerman</a>, the Games' former presenter, when Coin and Beetee hijack the signal to air a clip of Katniss. After seeing it, Peeta spontaneously shouts a warning that the Capitol is about to attack District 13. Coin orders a mass evacuation into deep underground shelters and the facility survives the attack unharmed. Upon emerging, Katniss discovers the area littered with white roses; she concludes that President Snow orchestrated this to inform her that the Capitol is holding Peeta captive, and whenever she condemns the Capitol, they’ll torture him in retaliation.
</p><p>As Peeta's warning gave the District an additional eight minutes evacuation time, Coin dispatches an elite special forces team, which includes Gale and Boggs, to rescue him, along with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Johanna_Mason" title="Johanna Mason">Johanna Mason</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Enobaria" title="Enobaria">Enobaria</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Annie_Cresta" title="Annie Cresta">Annie Cresta</a>, the remaining Victors, from their prison in the Capitol's Tribute Center.
</p><p>Beetee hijacks the Capitol's defense system to fill the frequencies with a "<a href="/wiki/Propaganda" title="Propaganda">propo</a>" narrated by Finnick, who explains how he had been prostituted by Snow under the threat of having his loved ones tortured and executed, as a means of convincing more districts to side with the rebellion. Snow cuts in to inform Katniss of his awareness of the rescue, then cuts the broadcast and Beetee’s communication link with the special forces. Gale's team rescues the three Victors and easily escapes the Capitol, indicating the Capitol reduced its security on purpose. When Katniss greets Peeta, he unexpectedly attacks and strangles her into unconsciousness, before being knocked out by Boggs.
</p><p>Katniss wakes up in a medical facility. She is informed that Peeta has been "hijacked" - brainwashed into trying to kill Katniss by associating memories of her with the terror created by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Tracker_jacker" title="Tracker jacker">tracker jacker</a> venom, which explains why the Capitol allowed the team to escape with him. Peeta is restrained and placed in <a href="/wiki/Solitary_confinement" title="Solitary confinement">solitary confinement</a>, while a serum is being developed to reverse the hijacking effects.
</p><p>Coin announces that the rebels' next objective is the Capitol's principal military stronghold in the ravines of District 2 - now the only district remaining loyal to the Capitol. The closing scene of the film leaves us with Katniss looking at Peeta as he struggles, attempting to escape from his bindings.
</p><p>As punishment for a past rebellion, the 12 districts of the nation of Panem are forced by the Capitol to select two tributes, one boy and one girl between  12 and 18, to fight to the death in the annual Hunger Games until there is only one survivor. In District 12, after her younger sister Primrose is chosen, <a href="/wiki/Katniss_Everdeen" title="Katniss Everdeen">Katniss Everdeen</a> volunteers to take her place. She and fellow tribute <a href="/wiki/Peeta_Mellark" title="Peeta Mellark">Peeta Mellark</a> are escorted to the Capitol by chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy, a past victor. Haymitch stresses the importance of gaining sponsors, as they can provide gifts during the Games. While training, Katniss observes the "Careers" (Marvel, Glimmer, Cato and Clove), volunteers from the wealthy Districts 1 and 2 who have trained for the Games from an early age. During a televised interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta expresses his love for Katniss, which she initially sees as an attempt to attract sponsors; she later learns his admission is genuine.
</p><p>At the start of the Games, Katniss ignores Haymitch's advice and grabs some of the supplies placed around the Cornucopia, a structure at the starting point, and narrowly escapes death. Half of the 24 tributes die in the initial melee, and only eleven, including the Careers, survive the first day. Katniss tries to stay away from the others, but the Head Gamemaker, Seneca Crane, triggers a forest fire to drive her towards them. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta has seemingly allied, and flees up a tree. Peeta advises the Careers to wait her out. The next morning, Katniss notices Rue, District 11's young female tribute, hiding in an adjacent tree. Rue draws her attention to a nest of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/The_Hunger_Games_universe#Tracker_jackers" title="The Hunger Games universe">tracker jackers</a>, genetically modified venomous wasps. Using a knife, Katniss saws the branch holding the nest off of the tree, causing it to fall on the Careers; Glimmer succumbs to the stings and dies, while the others escape to a nearby lake. Katniss is disoriented from being stung a few times; in a hallucination, Peeta returns and tells her to flee.
</p><p>Rue helps Katniss recover, and the two become friends and allies. Katniss destroys the supplies the Careers have stockpiled by detonating mines guarding them, while Rue provides a distraction. Katniss later finds and frees Rue from a net trap, but Marvel impales Rue with a spear thrown at Katniss, who then fatally shoots him with an arrow in response. Katniss comforts Rue and, after she dies, adorns her body with flowers. Afterward, she makes a three-finger salute to the cameras. This triggers a riot in District 11. President Coriolanus Snow warns Crane about the unrest that has been caused under his watch.
</p><p>Haymitch persuades Crane to change the rules to allow two winners provided they are from the same district, suggesting that this will pacify the public. After the announcement, Katniss searches for and finds a gravely wounded Peeta. Another announcement promises that what each survivor needs the most will be provided at the Cornucopia the next morning. Despite Peeta's strong opposition, Katniss leaves to get medicine for him, but is ambushed and overpowered by Clove. When Clove gloats about Rue's death, <a href="/wiki/List_of_The_Hunger_Games_characters#Thresh" title="List of The Hunger Games characters">Thresh</a>, District 11's male tribute, appears and brutally kills Clove by breaking her skull. He spares Katniss, for Rue's sake. Katniss takes the medicine, which heals Peeta.
</p><p>While hunting for food, Katniss hears a cannon go off, signaling a death. She races to Peeta and finds he has unknowingly collected deadly nightlock berries. They discover "Foxface", District 5's female tribute whose name they didn't know, dead from the berries she assumed were edible from watching Peeta.
</p><p>Crane then unleashes genetically modified beasts. They kill Thresh and force Katniss, Peeta and Cato onto the Cornucopia's roof. There, the last survivors must fight to a stalemate. Cato gets Peeta in a headlock and uses him as a human shield against Katniss's bow. Peeta directs Katniss to shoot Cato's hand, enabling Peeta to throw him to the beasts below. As Cato is torn apart, Katniss kills him with an arrow in an act of mercy rather than leaving Cato to suffer a more horrific death.
</p><p>However, the rule change about two victors is suddenly revoked. Peeta urges Katniss to shoot him, but she convinces him they should eat the nightlock together. Just before they do, Crane hastily declares them co-victors. Afterward, Haymitch warns Katniss that she has made enemies with these acts of defiance. Crane is then locked in a room with nightlock berries.

</p><p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alma_Coin" title="Alma Coin">President Coin</a> allows Katniss to join an assault on a mountain in District 2 housing the Capitol's main armory and air force. District 13's air force launches a bombing, burying the Peacekeepers but freeing numerous civilians. Although Katniss convinces the survivors to join the rebellion, she is shot by one, surviving with a bruised lung thanks to her bulletproof Mockingjay suit.
</p><p>Coin will not let Katniss join the assault on the Capitol, protecting her as a symbol. At the wedding of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Finnick_Odair" title="Finnick Odair">Finnick Odair</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Annie_Cresta" title="Annie Cresta">Annie Cresta</a>, Katniss is informed by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Johanna_Mason" title="Johanna Mason">Johanna Mason</a> of a supply craft leaving for the Capitol. 
</p><p>Coin has her assigned to the "Star Squad", which is led by Boggs and includes <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gale_Hawthorne" title="Gale Hawthorne">Gale</a>, amongst others. They will follow in relative safety behind the actual invasion force, providing video for propaganda purposes. Boggs carries a holographic map (the "Holo") to help them evade known <a href="/wiki/Booby_trap" title="Booby trap">booby-trapped</a> "pods", which line the streets. Coin also sends a not-fully-recovered Peeta to join the squad.
</p><p>Boggs is fatally wounded, giving the Holo to Katniss before dying. The squad triggers another pod which releases a flood of lethal black tar. Peeta momentarily succumbs to his conditioning and attacks Katniss, killing Mitchell in the process. Star Squad takes shelter in an abandoned building, where Jackson demands the Holo, until Katniss says that she is under secret orders from Coin to kill Snow. When a squad of Peacekeepers destroy their hideout, Star Squad escapes, but the Leeg twins are killed. The Capitol then broadcasts a message by <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Caesar_Flickerman" title="Caesar Flickerman">Caesar Flickerman</a> reporting Katniss's death and Snow denouncing the rebellion, which is interrupted by Coin, whose impassioned eulogy rallies the rebels.
</p><p>Star Squad takes to the sewers to avoid the Peacekeepers, but the group is detected and Snow sends a pack of genetically engineered "mutts" to ambush them. Jackson, Castor, and Homes are killed, then as Finnick sacrifices himself to allow the rest of the team to escape. Katniss sets the Holo's self-destruct, killing the remaining mutts, and Finnick to give him a merciful death. Messalla is vaporized by a pod., before the diminished Star Squad exits the sewer. They take refuge in a shop, where Tigris, a former Hunger Games stylist, hides them.
</p><p>As rebel forces advance, Snow invites Capitol citizens into his mansion in the city's center for protection, in the process forming a human shield. Katniss and Gale join the crowd, posing as refugees. Peacekeepers herd Capitol children toward the palace gates, when a hovercraft with a Capitol insignia flies overhead and drops small bombs, causing mass casualties. The rebels’ team of medics, including Katniss's sister Prim, attempt to help the injured, when a second wave of bombs detonate, killing Prim and knocking Katniss unconscious.
</p><p>Katniss revives and learns the rebels have won. She confronts a captured Snow, who explains that Coin staged the bombing as a means of turning the last of Snow's soldiers against him. Katniss realizes the attack does match a strategy Gale had suggested earlier to inflict maximum casualties on medics, and is stunned when Gale cannot deny his part in the death of Prim.
</p><p>Coin invites the surviving Hunger Games victors to a meeting, where she declares herself the interim President of Panem and asks the victors to vote for a last Hunger Games using the children of Capitol leaders. Peeta, Beetee and Annie denounce the idea, while Johanna and Enobaria side with Coin. Katniss votes yes in exchange for the right to execute Snow herself. <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Haymitch_Abernathy" title="Haymitch Abernathy">Haymitch</a> sides with Katniss, figuring she has a good reason.
</p><p>At the execution, Katniss kills Coin instead, causing a riot. Peeta stops her from taking suicide pills, and Katniss is arrested while witnessing enraged rebels beat Snow to death. In captivity, Katniss receives a letter from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Plutarch_Heavensbee" title="Plutarch Heavensbee">Plutarch</a> and is assured that she will eventually be pardoned, and will be able to return to District 12 once the dissension quiets. In District 12 she is joined by Peeta, who has recovered from his conditioning. Commander Paylor is elected the new President of Panem, Katniss is pardoned for Coin's killing, and bonds with Haymitch and Peeta over their shared trauma.
</p><p>Years later, Katniss and Peeta play with their two children.

Billionaire Bruce Wayne, who has operated in <a href="/wiki/Gotham_City" title="Gotham City">Gotham City</a> as the vigilante <a href="/wiki/Batman" title="Batman">Batman</a> for twenty years, sees Superman as an extraterrestrial threat to humanity. After learning of Batman's form of justice, <a href="/wiki/Clark_Kent" title="Clark Kent">Clark Kent</a> (Superman's civilian identity) seeks to expose him via <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Planet" title="Daily Planet">Daily Planet</a></i> articles.

He instead makes alternative plans with Finch's subordinate and gains access to Zod's body and the Kryptonian scout ship.
</p><p>Bruce attends a gala at LexCorp to steal encrypted data from the company's mainframe, but has it taken from him by an antiquities dealer named <a href="/wiki/Wonder_Woman" title="Wonder Woman">Diana Prince</a>; she eventually returns it to Bruce when she is unable to access the information. While decrypting the drive, Bruce dreams of a post-apocalyptic world where he leads a group of rebels against an evil Superman. He is awakened from his dream by an unidentified person, appearing through a portal, who warns him of <a href="/wiki/Lois_Lane" title="Lois Lane">Lois Lane</a>'s crucial role in the future, and urges him to find "the others" before vanishing.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Timeline1_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Timeline1-9">[N 2]</a></sup> Upon fully decrypting the drive, Wayne discovers Luthor's files on several metahuman individuals across the globe.

Wayne admits to <a href="/wiki/Alfred_Pennyworth" title="Alfred Pennyworth">Alfred Pennyworth</a> that he plans to steal the kryptonite to weaponize it, should it become necessary to fight Superman.
</p><p>At a Congressional hearing, as Finch questions Superman on the validity of his actions, a bomb smuggled by Luthor goes off and kills everyone present but Superman. Believing he should have detected the bomb, and frustrated by his failure to save them, Superman goes into self-imposed exile. Batman breaks into LexCorp and steals the kryptonite. In preparation to battle Superman, he builds a <a href="/wiki/Powered_exoskeleton" title="Powered exoskeleton">powered exoskeleton</a>, creates a kryptonite <a href="/wiki/Grenade_launcher" title="Grenade launcher">grenade launcher</a>, and a kryptonite-tipped spear.

</p><p>To bring Superman out of exile, Luthor kidnaps Lois and <a href="/wiki/Jonathan_and_Martha_Kent" title="Jonathan and Martha Kent">Martha Kent</a>, Clark's adoptive mother. Lex throws Lois off the LexCorp building, but Superman quickly saves her and goes on to confront Luthor, who reveals to Superman that he manipulated Superman and Batman against each other by fueling their mutual distrust. Luthor demands that Superman kill Batman in exchange for Martha's life. Superman tries to explain the situation to Batman, but instead Batman attacks Superman and eventually subdues him with the aid of a kryptonite gas. Before Batman can kill Superman with the spear, Superman urges Batman to "save Martha", whose name is also shared with Batman's mother, confusing him long enough for Lois to arrive and explain what Superman meant. Realizing how far he has fallen and unwilling to let an innocent die, Batman rescues Martha, while Superman confronts Luthor on the scout ship.

When they are all outmatched, Superman realizes its vulnerability to kryptonite, and retrieves the spear to kill it. After impaling it with the spear, in the creature's last moments, it kills Superman, having been weakened himself by exposure to kryptonite.
</p><p>Luthor is arrested and Batman confronts him in prison, warning Luthor that he will always be watching him. Luthor gloats that Superman's death has made the world vulnerable to powerful alien threats. A memorial is held for Superman in Metropolis. Clark is also declared dead, with various friends and family members including Bruce Wayne and Diana Prince attending his funeral in <a href="/wiki/Smallville_(comics)" title="Smallville (comics)">Smallville</a>. Martha gives an envelope to Lois, which contains an engagement ring from Clark. After the funeral, Bruce expresses his regrets to Diana about how he failed Superman. He reveals to her that he plans to form a team of metahumans, starting with those from Luthor's files, to help protect the world in Superman's absence. After they leave, the dirt atop Clark's coffin levitates.
</p><p>With Krypton destabilized from mining of the planet's core, <a href="/wiki/Jor-El" title="Jor-El">Jor-El</a>, chief advisor to Krypton's supreme council, recommends the council give him control of the genetics codex. Before any action can be taken, soldiers led by <a href="/wiki/General_Zod" title="General Zod">General Zod</a>, an old friend of El's, launch an uprising and arrest the councilors. Realising that Krypton is doomed, El steals the genetic codex sought by Zod and infuses them into the DNA of his infant son, Kal-El—the first naturally born Kryptonian child in centuries. Donning his old armor, El sacrifices his life to allow his son to escape on a preprogrammed spacecraft. The council quashes Zod's rebellion, and its members are sentenced to exile in the <a href="/wiki/Phantom_Zone" title="Phantom Zone">Phantom Zone</a> after being convicted of treason.

He then learns his true origins from Jonathan, who urges him to keep his powers hidden. Several years later, Jonathan dies in a tornado while refusing to let Clark rescue him. Burdened with guilt and looking for a new purpose in his life, Clark leaves to travel the world for an extended period of time under several disguises.

Disguised as a worker, Clark enters the ship and activates its central computer using a key left by Jor-El, which allows him to communicate with an artificial intelligence modeled after his father. The AI explains that Clark was sent to Earth to guide its people, and presents him with a Kryptonian uniform bearing his family's symbol. While following Clark, Lois inadvertently triggers the ship's security system. Clark uses his powers to rescue Lois before wearing the uniform and testing his flying abilities. Unable to convince supervisor <a href="/wiki/Perry_White" title="Perry White">Perry White</a> to publish an article on the incident, Lois tracks down Clark in Smallville, with the intent of exposing him. However, after hearing of Jonathan Kent's sacrifice, Lois drops the story, keeping Clark's identity safe, despite Perry's suspicions.
</p><p>Escaping the Phantom Zone, Zod and his crew intercept a transmission from the scout vessel and travel to Earth. Deducing that Kal-El is nearby, they broadcast a global address demanding that he surrender or risk war. Clark meets with the United States Air Force and agrees to comply, with Lois joining him as a hostage. Zod reveals that he possesses numerous <a href="/wiki/Terraforming" title="Terraforming">terraforming</a> devices, the largest called a World Engine, which he salvaged from Kryptonian outposts, which he intends to use to transform Earth into a new Krypton. His science officer, <a href="/wiki/Jax-Ur" title="Jax-Ur">Jax-Ur</a>, extracts Clark's genes to create Kryptonian colonists who will annihilate humanity and build a society based on Zod's ideals of genetic purity.
</p><p>Using the Jor-El AI to take over the ship, Clark and Lois flee and warn the U.S. military after an explosive confrontation between Clark and Zod's troops in Smallville, just as Zod orders an invasion. Zod deploys the World Engine from the Kryptonian ship, which touches down in the Indian Ocean and begins firing a beam through the planet towards the ship, severely damaging <a href="/wiki/Metropolis_(comics)" title="Metropolis (comics)">Metropolis</a>, and initiating the terraforming strategy. Given the codename "<a href="/wiki/Superman" title="Superman">Superman</a>", Clark destroys the terraforming platform while the military launches a suicide attack, sending Zod's troops back to the Phantom Zone. With the ship destroyed and Krypton's only hope of revival gone, Zod vows to destroy the Earth and its inhabitants just to spite Superman. The two Kryptonians engage in a lengthy battle across Metropolis, which concludes when Superman is forced to break Zod's neck as he attacks a family in a train station.

</p><p>Knowing Superman could stop his plan, Lex deduces that a meteorite found in <a href="/wiki/Addis_Ababa" title="Addis Ababa">Addis Ababa</a> is actually part of Krypton and is radioactive to Superman. After he and his accomplices Otis and Eve Teschmacher retrieve a piece of it, Luthor lures Superman to his underground lair and reveals his plan to cause everything west of the San Andreas Fault to sink into the Pacific Ocean, leaving Luthor's desert as the new <a href="/wiki/West_Coast_of_the_United_States" title="West Coast of the United States">West Coast</a>.  Luthor then exposes him to a mineral from the meteor piece, <a href="/wiki/Kryptonite" title="Kryptonite">Kryptonite</a>, that weakens Superman greatly. Luthor further taunts Superman by revealing the other missile is headed in the eastbound direction toward <a href="/wiki/Hackensack,_New_Jersey" title="Hackensack, New Jersey">Hackensack, New Jersey</a>. Teschmacher is horrified because her mother lives in Hackensack, but Luthor does not care and leaves Superman to die a slow death.  Knowing his reputation for keeping his word, Teschmacher rescues Superman on the condition that he will stop the eastbound missile first; Superman reluctantly agrees. After Teschmacher frees him, Superman diverts the eastbound missile into outer space, consequently preventing him from reaching the westbound missile before it explodes in the San Andreas Fault. Massive earthquakes erupt across California, damaging the <a href="/wiki/Golden_Gate_Bridge" title="Golden Gate Bridge">Golden Gate Bridge</a> and causing the <a href="/wiki/Hollywood_Sign" title="Hollywood Sign">Hollywood Sign</a> to collapse and the <a href="/wiki/Hoover_Dam" title="Hoover Dam">Hoover Dam</a> to breach, endangering lives. Superman mitigates the effects of the explosion by sealing the fault line, preventing Luthor's plan from reaching fruition.
</p><p>While Superman is busy saving others, Lois' car falls into a crevice from one of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Aftershocks" title="Aftershocks">aftershocks</a>, trapping her as it fills with dirt and debris.  Superman is unable to reach her in time, and she suffocates.  Angered at being powerless to save her, Superman defies Jor-El's earlier warning not to manipulate human history, preferring to heed Jonathan's advice that he must be here for "a reason". He accelerates around Earth, traveling several minutes backward in time, to prevent Lois' death.  After saving the West Coast, he brings Luthor and Otis to prison.  He then flies into the sunrise for further adventures.

Lois suspects Clark and Superman are the same person after Clark is absent when Superman appears to save a falling kid.

He takes her to his <a href="/wiki/Fortress_of_Solitude" title="Fortress of Solitude">Fortress of Solitude</a> in the <a href="/wiki/Arctic" title="Arctic">Arctic</a>, and shows her the traces of his past stored in energy crystals. Superman declares his love for Lois and his wish to spend his life with her. After conferring with the artificial intelligence of his mother Lara, Superman removes his superpowers by exposing himself to red Kryptonian sunlight in a crystal chamber, becoming a mortal.  Clark and Lois spend the night together, then leave the Fortress and return from the Arctic by automobile. Arriving at a diner, Clark is beaten up by a truck driver named Rocky.

When the President pleads for Superman to save the Earth, General Zod demands that Superman come and "kneel before Zod!" Clark and Lois learn of Zod's conquest and, realizing that humanity alone cannot fight Zod, Clark tries to regain his powers.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Lex_Luthor" title="Lex Luthor">Lex Luthor</a> escapes from prison with Eve Teschmacher's help, leaving his accomplice Otis behind. Luthor and Teschmacher infiltrate the Fortress of Solitude before Superman and Lois arrive. Luthor learns of Superman's connection to Jor-El and General Zod. He finds Zod at the White House and tells him Superman is the son of Jor-El, their jailer, and offers to lead him to Superman in exchange for control of Australia. The three Kryptonians ally with Luthor and go to the offices of the <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Planet" title="Daily Planet">Daily Planet</a></i>. Superman arrives, after having found the green crystal that restores his powers, and battles the three. Zod realizes Superman cares for the humans and takes advantage of this by threatening bystanders. Superman realizes the only way to stop Zod and the others is to lure them to the Fortress. Superman flies off, with Zod, Ursa, and Non in pursuit, kidnapping Lois and taking along Luthor. Upon arrival, Zod declares Luthor has outlived his usefulness and plans to kill both him and Superman. Superman tries to get Luthor to lure the three into the crystal chamber to depower them, but Luthor, eager to get back in Zod's favor, reveals the chamber's secret to the villains. Zod forces Superman into the chamber and activates it; however, Superman crushes Zod's hand and tosses him into a crevice. Luthor deduces that Superman reconfigured the chamber to expose the trio to red sunlight while Superman was protected from it. Non falls into another crevice when trying to fly over it and Lois knocks Ursa into a third. Superman flies back to civilization, returning Luthor to prison and Lois home.
</p><p>At the <i>Daily Planet</i> the following day, Clark finds Lois upset about knowing his secret and not being able to be open about her true feelings. He kisses her, using his abilities to wipe her mind of her knowledge of the past few days. Later, Clark returns to the diner and has a rematch with Rocky the truck driver and defeats him easily. Superman restores the damage done by Zod, replacing the flag atop the White House and tells the president he won't abandon his duty again.

Gus and Vera, disguised as <a href="/wiki/United_States_Army" title="United States Army">Army</a> officers, give Superman the flawed Kryptonite, which has no immediate effect, but Superman soon becomes selfish; his desire for Lana causes him to delay rescuing a truck driver from a jackknifed rig hanging from a bridge.

</p><p>After defending himself from rockets and an <a href="/wiki/LGM-118_Peacekeeper" title="LGM-118 Peacekeeper">MX missile</a>, Superman confronts Ross, Vera, and Lorelei. Gus's supercomputer identifies him as a threat and attempts to determine his weakness, unleashing a beam of pure Kryptonite.
</p><p>Guilt-ridden and horrified by the prospect of "going down in history as the man who killed Superman", Gus destroys the Kryptonite ray with a firefighter's axe, whereupon Superman flees. The computer becomes self-aware, defending itself against Gus's attempts to disable it. Ross and Lorelei escape the control room, but Vera is transformed into a <a href="/wiki/Cyborg" title="Cyborg">cyborg</a>. Vera attacks her brother and Lorelei with beams of energy that immobilize them. Superman returns with a canister of the beltric acid. Superman places the canister by the supercomputer, which does not resist as it suspects no danger.

Lacy takes a liking to Clark and tries to seduce him; Clark agrees to go on a date with her. Following the news that the United States and the <a href="/wiki/Soviet_Union" title="Soviet Union">Soviet Union</a> may engage in a nuclear arms race, Clark is conflicted about how much Superman should intervene.

Returning to Metropolis, Lex and Lenny steal a strand of Superman's hair from a museum and create a genetic matrix which Lex attaches to a U.S. nuclear missile. After the missile is test launched, Superman intercepts it and throws it into the Sun. A glowing ball of energy is discharged, which develops into a superhuman. This "Nuclear Man" makes his way back to Earth to find his "father", Lex, who establishes that while his creation is powerful, he will deactivate without exposure to sunlight. A vicious battle ensues between Lex's creation and Superman.

Nuclear Man kicks Superman into the distance with such strength that Superman's cape falls off.
</p><p>To Lois' disgust, the <i>Daily Planet</i> (which has been reformatted as a tabloid newspaper) publishes the headline "Superman Dead?", Lois indicates a desire to quit and seizes Superman's recovered cape for herself. Lacy is also upset and reveals to Lois that she cares for Clark. Lois ventures to Clark's apartment where she proclaims her love for Superman. Felled by radiation sickness, Clark staggers to his terrace where he retrieves the Kryptonian energy module and attempts to heal himself. Having developed a crush on Lacy, Nuclear Man threatens mayhem if she is not brought to him. The newly restored Superman agrees to take him to her to prevent anyone else from being hurt. Superman lures Nuclear Man into an elevator car, trapping him inside and then depositing it on the far side of the Moon. As the Sun rises, Nuclear Man breaks free due to a sliver of sunlight through a crack in the elevator doors and Superman is again forced to defend himself. At the end of the battle, it appears as that Superman has been defeated, as he is driven into the Moon's surface by Nuclear Man.
</p><p>Nuclear Man forces his way into the <i>Daily Planet</i> and abducts Lacy, carrying her into outer space. Superman manages to free himself from the Moon's surface, he then pushes it out of its orbit, casting Earth into an <a href="/wiki/Solar_eclipse" title="Solar eclipse">eclipse</a>, nullifying Nuclear Man's powers and leaving Lacy helpless in space. Superman rescues Lacy and returns her to Earth, then recovers Nuclear Man and deposits him into the core of a nuclear power plant, destroying him.

A man named Zaltar allows Kara to see a unique and immensely powerful item known as the Omegahedron, which he has borrowed without the knowledge of the city government, and which powers the city. However, after a mishap, the Omegahedron is blown out into space. After overhearing the wariness of her parents, Kara follows it to Earth (undergoing a transformation into "Supergirl" in the process) in an effort to recover it and save the city.
</p><p>On Earth, the Omegahedron is recovered by Selena, a power-hungry would-be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Witch" title="Witch">witch</a> assisted by the feckless Bianca, seeking to free herself from her relationship with <a href="/wiki/Warlock" title="Warlock">warlock</a> Nigel. Whilst not knowing exactly what it is, Selena quickly realizes that the Omegahedron is powerful and can enable her to perform real magical spells. Supergirl arrives on Earth and discovers her new powers. Following the path of the Omegahedron, she takes the name Linda Lee, identifies herself as the cousin of <a href="/wiki/Clark_Kent" title="Clark Kent">Clark Kent</a>, and enrolls at an all-girls school where she befriends Lucy Lane, the younger sister of <a href="/wiki/Lois_Lane" title="Lois Lane">Lois Lane</a> who happens to be studying there. Supergirl also meets and becomes enamoured with Ethan, who works as a <a href="/wiki/Groundskeeping" title="Groundskeeping">groundskeeper</a> at the school.
</p><p>Ethan also catches the eye of Selena, who drugs him with a love potion (which will make him fall in love with the first person he sees for a day); however, Ethan regains consciousness in Selena's absence and wanders out into the streets. An angry Selena uses her new-found powers to animate a construction vehicle which she sends to bring Ethan back, causing chaos in the streets as it does so. Supergirl rescues Ethan and he falls in love with her instead while in the guise of Linda Lee.

Here Supergirl discovers she's lost her powers, she begins to wander the bleak landscape, but misses her footing, falls into a swamp and passes out. Zaltar, who has exiled himself to the Phantom Zone as a punishment for losing the Omegahedron finds Kara. After she regains consciousness Zaltar sacrifices his life to allow Supergirl to escape. Back on Earth, Selena misuses the Omegahedron to make herself a "princess of Earth", with Ethan as her lover and <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/consort" title="wikt:consort">consort</a>. Emerging from the Phantom Zone through a mirror, Supergirl regains her powers and confronts Selena, who uses the Omegahedron's power to summon a gigantic shadow demon. The demon overwhelms Supergirl and is on the verge of defeating her when she hears Zaltar's voice urging her to fight on. Supergirl breaks free and is told by Nigel the only way to defeat Selena is to turn the shadow demon against her. Supergirl quickly complies and begins flying in circles around her, trapping her in a tornado. Selena is attacked and incapacitated by the monster as the whirlwind pulls Bianca in as well. The three of them are sucked back into the mirror portal, which promptly reforms, trapping them all within forever. Free from Selena's spell, Ethan admits his love for Linda and that he knows that she and Supergirl are one and the same, but knows it is possible he may never see her again and understands she must save Argo City. The final scene shows Kara returning the Omegahedron to a darkened Argo City, which promptly lights up again.
</p><p>For the previous five years, Superman has mysteriously abandoned his adopted home of Earth while on a journey into outer space to investigate what astronomers believed to be an intact <a href="/wiki/Krypton_(comics)" title="Krypton (comics)">Krypton</a>. In his absence, journalist and past love Lois Lane wrote a scathing article "Why the World Doesn't Need Superman", winning her the <a href="/wiki/Pulitzer_Prize" title="Pulitzer Prize">Pulitzer Prize</a>. Lois is engaged to Richard White, the nephew of <i><a href="/wiki/Daily_Planet" title="Daily Planet">Daily Planet</a></i> editor-in-chief Perry White, and with whom she shares a young asthmatic son, Jason. Notorious criminal mastermind Lex Luthor secured an early release from prison due to Superman not appearing as a prosecution witness during Luthor's fifth appeal trial. By seducing an old heiress, Luthor is able to inherit her fortune, giving him resources for his next scheme.
</p><p>Superman returns to Earth, crash landing at the Kent farm, just as he did as a child. He reveals to his adoptive mother Martha Kent that he left hoping to find his homeworld, and expresses his dismay at being the only one of his kind remaining. Upon returning to <a href="/wiki/Metropolis_(comics)" title="Metropolis (comics)">Metropolis</a> in his human identity of Clark Kent, he is shocked to discover the consequences of his disappearance.
</p><p>When a mysterious nationwide power outage causes catastrophic failures during a space shuttle launch, Clark realizes he must reemerge as Superman. Saving the shuttle and its ferry jet in highly public fashion causes a resurgence of media attention regarding Superman's return. Unbeknownst to anyone, the accident was triggered by Luthor using Kryptonian technology stolen from the <a href="/wiki/Fortress_of_Solitude" title="Fortress of Solitude">Fortress of Solitude</a>.
</p><p>Luthor sends his <a href="/wiki/Gun_moll" title="Gun moll">moll</a>, Kitty, to distract Superman, allowing him to steal a sample of <a href="/wiki/Kryptonite" title="Kryptonite">kryptonite</a> from a museum. Still investigating the earlier power outage, Lois tracks the <a href="/wiki/Hypocenter" title="Hypocenter">hypocenter</a> to the mansion Luthor recently inherited and, along with her son, explores the yacht docked there. Discovering Luthor, she is held captive as the yacht heads out into the Atlantic. Luthor plans to use the Kryptonian crystal technology Superman used to create his Fortress of Solitude to create a new land mass which would swallow the continental United States. Placing a crystal inside a shell of refined kryptonite, Luthor triggers the new land growth by launching it into the sea.
</p><p>Lois manages to use a fax machine on board the yacht to send their location to the Daily Planet headquarters, where it catches the attention of Clark and Richard. Upon discovering her attempt at subversion, one of Luthor's henchmen attacks Lois, causing Jason's powers to emerge as he crushes the henchman with a piano – revealing that the (no longer asthmatic) Jason is Superman's son. Realizing this fact, Luthor and his thugs escape by helicopter as the earthquake effects from the growing landmass span back to Metropolis. While Superman works to contain the damage in the city, Richard reaches the yacht by way of a <a href="/wiki/Floatplane" title="Floatplane">floatplane</a> and releases Lois and Jason from their locked room. The three become trapped when the yacht is split in two by the growing rock formations, knocking Lois unconscious and sinking the yacht. Superman rescues them and gets them to the safety of Richard's plane.
</p><p>Superman pursues Luthor, who has made his way to the growing land mass. The kryptonite shell surrounding the crystal has caused the new rock formations to be infused with kryptonite, making the land itself toxic to Superman. Luthor and his thugs easily manage to brutalize Superman into submission as he is unable to fight back. Superman tries to flee, but Luthor stabs Superman with a kryptonite shard, before leaving him to drown. 
</p><p>Regaining consciousness in the escaping floatplane, Lois learns that Superman has gone to confront Luthor. Knowing of the kryptonite danger, Lois convinces Richard to double back to help him. Jason spots Superman in the water and Lois and Richard get him into the plane, where Lois removes the shard. Recovering, Superman flies high into the atmosphere to regain his strength by exposure to sunlight. Using his <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Heat_vision_(fiction)" title="Heat vision (fiction)">heat vision</a>, he then tunnels deep under the new land mass and, mass killed Luthor's henchmen, using the last of his strength, is able to fly it off into space before it absorbs more land. 
</p><p>Escaping with Luthor in the helicopter, Kitty discards the remaining crystals and the two eventually end up on a deserted island when they run out of fuel. Complications from kryptonite exposure cause Superman to fall into a coma, and while doctors are able to remove more fragments from his skin, they cannot revive him. Lois visits him in the hospital and whispers into his ear while glancing at Jason. Soon after, hospital staff discovers his room empty. No longer feeling alone in the universe, Superman visits his newly revealed son in the boy's room and repeats to Jason the words of his <a href="/wiki/Jor-El" title="Jor-El">own father</a> as he sleeps. Lois starts writing another article, titled "Why the World Needs Superman". Superman reassures her that he is now back to stay, and flies off into space, where he gazes down at the world.

A battlesuit-clad Luthor joins the fight against Doomsday, aiming to become Metropolis’ “true savior,” but is incapacitated and saved by Superman. Realizing the toll the battle has taken on Superman, Lois attempts to sacrifice herself to Doomsday to force Clark into using lethal force. As the beast prepares to kill Lois, Superman hurls himself at Doomsday – he breaks the villain’s neck, but is fatally stabbed by accident, and dies in Lois’ arms.

After a <a href="/wiki/State_funeral" title="State funeral">state funeral</a> for the fallen Man of Steel, the Kents welcome Lois into their family. Jimmy brings Lois to Superman's mausoleum where they find his coffin open and witness a figure resembling Superman fly away. At S.T.A.R.

Each one of them is different in their personalities and crime-fighting style compared to the original Man of Steel; leaving the world questioning which one, if any, is the true Superman come back to life. <a href="/wiki/Lois_Lane" title="Lois Lane">Lois Lane</a>, still reeling from Clark's death, decides to investigate.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Lex_Luthor" title="Lex Luthor">Lex Luthor</a> holds a press conference introducing Superboy as the true Superman, sponsored and bankrolled by <a href="/wiki/LexCorp" title="LexCorp">LexCorp</a>. Lois attends the conference, along with Steel, and sneaks inside one of the labs inside LexCorp. It is there that Lois discovers through scientist <a href="/wiki/Dabney_Donovan" title="Dabney Donovan">Dabney Donovan</a> that Superboy is a clone of Superman. Suddenly, the conference is attacked by the Eradicator, who seeks to "eradicate" Luthor. Superboy and later Steel try to stop him, only to be defeated until the timely arrival of Cyborg Superman, who fights and drives away Eradicator; making him come across as the real Superman to many and angering Luthor. Lois writes an expose revealing Superboy to be a clone and asking if all of the Supermen are fakes. This leads to a meeting between her and Cyborg Superman, telling him she knows he isn't the Superman she knew and loved. 
</p><p>Luthor, angry that Superboy wasn't declared the true Superman, forces Superboy to be security detail for the <a href="/wiki/President_of_the_United_States" title="President of the United States">President of the United States</a>. Superboy soon butts heads with the <a href="/wiki/Justice_League" title="Justice League">Justice League</a> as the President arrives to launch the new <a href="/wiki/Justice_League_Watchtower" title="Justice League Watchtower">Justice League Watchtower</a>. Then, a <a href="/wiki/Boom_tube" title="Boom tube">boom tube</a> opens and <a href="/wiki/Parademon" title="Parademon">Parademons</a> terrorize the event. Superboy is defeated, and the Justice League hold their own while Cyborg Superman saves the President. Then the boom tube collapses and falls onto the League, appearing to have killed all of them. With Cyborg Superman declared the "real" Superman, Luthor angrily reveals Superboy's a clone of Superman and himself; killing Donovan out of frustration. While Cyborg Superman visits the grave of Terri Henshaw, he gets a message from <a href="/wiki/Darkseid" title="Darkseid">Darkseid</a> to begin. Lois and Irons learn of this visit, and discover that Cyborg Superman is really <a href="/wiki/Hank_Henshaw" title="Hank Henshaw">Hank Henshaw</a>. 
</p><p>Cyborg Superman announces to the world his plans for a new Justice League; a Cyber Corps, composed of regular people that he grants superpowers. Everyone agrees, and while it has good results at first, many become drones in the process, losing their humanity. Lois recognizes the technology as <a href="/wiki/Apokolips" title="Apokolips">Apokoliptian</a> and questions Luthor's involvement, as he's stolen the technology before. Steel confronts <a href="/wiki/Intergang" title="Intergang">Intergang</a>, Luthor's buyers of the tech, only to discover that they have been attacked by the Eradicator.  Steel follows the weapons' signal to the <a href="/wiki/Fortress_of_Solitude" title="Fortress of Solitude">Fortress of Solitude</a> while Lois breaks into Luthor's penthouse and meets Superboy once again. Steel and the Eradicator fight while Lois and Superboy, and later Luthor, get a video call from the fight. Lois discovers the Eradicator is technology that protects <a href="/wiki/Kryptonian" title="Kryptonian">Kryptonians</a>, and realizes that the real Superman is inside the Fortress. Soon, Superman is revived and stops the fight. At the same time, Lois and Luthor see a broadcast from inside Cyborg Superman's mind, revealing Darkseid and his plans to invade, and that he orchestrated the deaths of both Superman and the Justice League in response to the failure of his <a href="/wiki/Justice_League:_War" title="Justice League: War">previous attempt</a>. Lois and Luthor form a plan just as Superman, Steel, and Superboy head to <a href="/wiki/Metropolis_(comics)" title="Metropolis (comics)">Metropolis</a>.
</p><p>Cyborg Superman begins the invasion, using the Cyber Corps to open a giant boom tube over Metropolis as Lois heads inside the Watchtower and reveals to Cyborg Superman that she knows who he really is. When the Watchtower reveals the real Superman heading towards him, Henshaw betrays Darkseid and closes the boom tube, stopping the invasion, so he can personally kill Superman and take his revenge against him. He orders the drones to attack Metropolis, just as Superman arrives and the fight begins. The battle is one-sided though, as Superman isn't at full strength yet, and Cyborg Superman reveals he blames Superman for not being there to save him and his wife from the Excalibur space shuttle disaster. Luthor uses the <a href="/wiki/Mother_Box" title="Mother Box">Mother Box</a> to free the Justice League, who were actually imprisoned in another dimension, to help Steel and Superboy defeat the drones. Cyborg Superman launches the Watchtower into orbit to prevent the League from aiding Lois and Superman. With Superman nearly defeated, Lois opens the Watchtower's windows so the sun's yellow rays shine on Superman, bringing him back to full power and allowing him to defeat and kill Cyborg Superman with help from his "wild card", the Eradicator. With Cyborg Superman dead, the battle ends when the drones are deactivated, although all of the people who were turned into drones die in the process. 
</p><p>Weeks later, Clark Kent is revealed to be alive (with the cover story of having been stranded off grid during the Doomsday attack), and the real Superman, donning a new suit, is welcomed back to the world with open arms. Clark later tells Lois that Superboy, with the new name Conner, now lives with his parents Jonathan and Martha Kent.
</p><p>In a <a href="/wiki/Post-credits_scene" title="Post-credits scene">post-credits scene</a>, the Justice League meet up at the Watchtower and agree to end the war with Darkseid by going to Apokolips. Luthor agrees, revealing that the Justice League have (reluctantly) invited him to join as their newest member.
</p><p>At a <a href="/wiki/New_Year%27s_Eve" title="New Year's Eve">New Year's Eve</a> party in 1999, <a href="/wiki/Tony_Stark_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)" title="Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)">Tony Stark</a> meets scientist <a href="/wiki/Maya_Hansen" title="Maya Hansen">Maya Hansen</a>, the inventor of an experimental regenerative treatment named <a href="/wiki/Extremis" title="Extremis">Extremis</a> that allows recovery from crippling injuries. Disabled scientist <a href="/wiki/Aldrich_Killian" title="Aldrich Killian">Aldrich Killian</a> offers them a place in his company <a href="/wiki/Advanced_Idea_Mechanics" title="Advanced Idea Mechanics">Advanced Idea Mechanics</a>, but Stark rejects him. In December 2012, seven months after the <a href="/wiki/The_Avengers_(2012_film)" title="The Avengers (2012 film)">battle of New York</a>, Stark is suffering from <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/PTSD" title="PTSD">Post Traumatic Stress Disorder</a>, and is having frequent panic and anxiety attacks due to his experiences during the alien invasion and subsequent battle.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Timeline_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Timeline-9">[N 2]</a></sup> Restless, he has built dozens of new <a href="/wiki/Iron_Man%27s_armor_in_other_media#Live_action" title="Iron Man's armor in other media">Iron Man suits</a>, creating friction with his girlfriend <a href="/wiki/Pepper_Potts" title="Pepper Potts">Pepper Potts</a>.
</p><p>A string of bombings claimed by a terrorist known as the <a href="/wiki/Mandarin_(comics)" title="Mandarin (comics)">Mandarin</a> has left intelligence agencies bewildered by a lack of forensic evidence. Stark's security chief <a href="/wiki/Happy_Hogan_(comics)" title="Happy Hogan (comics)">Happy Hogan</a> is badly injured in one such attack, prompting Stark to boldly issue a televised threat to the Mandarin, revealing his home address in the process. The Mandarin sends gunship helicopters to destroy Stark's home. Hansen, who came to warn Stark, survives the attack with Potts. Stark escapes in an experimental new Iron Man suit, which his <a href="/wiki/Artificial_intelligence" title="Artificial intelligence">artificial intelligence</a> <a href="/wiki/Edwin_Jarvis" title="Edwin Jarvis">J.A.R.V.I.S.</a> pilots to rural Tennessee, following a flight plan from Stark's investigation into the Mandarin. Stark's new armor is not fully functional, and lacks sufficient power to return to California, leaving the world to believe him dead.
</p><p>Teaming with Harley, a 10-year-old boy, Stark investigates the remains of a local explosion bearing the hallmarks of a Mandarin attack. He discovers the "bombings" were triggered by soldiers subjected to Extremis whose bodies explosively rejected the treatment. These explosions were falsely attributed to a terrorist plot in order to cover up Extremis's flaws. Stark witnesses Extremis first hand when Mandarin agents <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ellen_Brandt" title="Ellen Brandt">Brandt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Coldblood" title="Coldblood">Savin</a> attack him. Meanwhile, Killian resurfaces and kidnaps Potts and Hansen. American intelligence agencies continue to search for the Mandarin's location, with <a href="/wiki/War_Machine" title="War Machine">James Rhodes</a>—the former War Machine, now re-branded as the <a href="/wiki/Iron_Patriot" title="Iron Patriot">Iron Patriot</a>—lured into a trap to steal his Iron Man-like armor.
</p><p>With Harley's help, Stark traces the Mandarin to <a href="/wiki/Miami" title="Miami">Miami</a> and infiltrates his headquarters using improvised weapons. Inside he discovers the Mandarin is actually an English actor named <a href="/wiki/Trevor_Slattery" title="Trevor Slattery">Trevor Slattery</a>, who is oblivious to the actions carried out in his image. Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin behind Slattery's cover. After capturing Stark, Killian reveals that he has subjected Potts to Extremis in the hope that Stark will help fix Extremis's flaws while trying to save her. Killian fatally shoots Hansen when she tries to stop him.
</p><p>Stark escapes and reunites with Rhodes, discovering that Killian intends to attack President Ellis aboard <a href="/wiki/Air_Force_One" title="Air Force One">Air Force One</a>, using the Iron Patriot armor. Stark saves some surviving passengers and crew but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. They trace Killian to an impounded damaged oil tanker where Killian intends to kill Ellis on live television. The Vice President will become a puppet leader, following Killian's orders in exchange for Extremis to cure his young daughter's disability. On the platform, Stark works to save Potts, as Rhodes goes after the President. Stark summons his remaining Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Rhodes secures the President and takes him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived the Extremis procedure; before he can save her, a rig collapses around them and she falls to her apparent death. Stark fights Killian and traps him in an Iron Man suit that he self-destructs, but fails to kill him. Potts, whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive her fall, intervenes and kills Killian.
</p><p>Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy each Iron Man suit as a sign of his devotion to Potts, while the Vice President and Slattery are arrested. With Stark's help, Potts' Extremis effects are stabilized, and Stark promises to scale back his life as Iron Man, undergoing surgery to remove the shrapnel near his heart and throwing his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea. He muses that, even without the technology, he will always be Iron Man.
</p><p>In Russia, the media covers <a href="/wiki/Tony_Stark_(Marvel_Cinematic_Universe)" title="Tony Stark (Marvel Cinematic Universe)">Tony Stark</a>'s disclosure of his identity as Iron Man. <a href="/wiki/Whiplash_(comics)" title="Whiplash (comics)">Ivan Vanko</a>, whose father <a href="/wiki/Crimson_Dynamo#Anton_Vanko" title="Crimson Dynamo">Anton Vanko</a> has just died, sees this and begins building a miniature arc reactor similar to Stark's. Six months later,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Timeline_10-0"><a href="#cite_note-Timeline-10">[N 2]</a></sup> Stark is a superstar and uses his Iron Man suit for peaceful means, resisting government pressure to sell his designs.

</p><p>The <a href="/wiki/Palladium" title="Palladium">palladium</a> core in the arc reactor that keeps Stark alive and powers the armor is slowly poisoning him, and he cannot find a substitute. Growing increasingly reckless and despondent about his impending death, and choosing not to tell anyone about his condition, Stark appoints his personal assistant <a href="/wiki/Pepper_Potts" title="Pepper Potts">Pepper Potts</a> CEO of Stark Industries, and hires Stark employee Natalie Rushman to replace her as his personal assistant. Stark competes in the <a href="/wiki/Historic_Grand_Prix_of_Monaco" title="Historic Grand Prix of Monaco">Monaco Historic Grand Prix</a>, where he is attacked in the middle of the race by Vanko, who wields electrified whips. Stark dons his portable armor and defeats Vanko, but the suit is severely damaged. Vanko explains his intention was to prove to the world that Iron Man is not invincible. Impressed by Vanko's performance, Stark's rival, <a href="/wiki/Justin_Hammer" title="Justin Hammer">Justin Hammer</a>, fakes Vanko's death while breaking him out of prison and asks him to build a line of armored suits to upstage Stark. During what he believes is his final birthday party, Stark gets drunk while wearing the Iron Man suit. Disgusted, Stark's best friend, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/U.S._Air_Force" title="U.S. Air Force">U.S. Air Force</a> Lieutenant Colonel <a href="/wiki/War_Machine" title="War Machine">James Rhodes</a> dons Stark's prototype armor and tries to restrain him.

Fury explains that Vanko's father jointly invented the arc reactor with Stark, but when Anton tried to sell it for profit, Stark had him deported. The Soviets sent Anton to the gulag. Fury gives Stark some of his father's old material; a hidden message in the <a href="/wiki/Diorama" title="Diorama">diorama</a> of the 1974 Stark Expo proves to be a diagram of the structure of a new element. With the aid of his computer <a href="/wiki/Edwin_Jarvis#J.A.R.V.I.S." title="Edwin Jarvis">J.A.R.V.I.S.</a>, Stark synthesizes it. When he learns Vanko is still alive, he places the new element in his arc reactor and ends his palladium dependency.
</p><p>At the Expo, Hammer unveils Vanko's armored drones, led by Rhodes in a heavily weaponized version of the prototype armor. Stark arrives to warn Rhodes, but Vanko remotely takes control of both the drones and Rhodes' armor and attacks Stark. Hammer is arrested while Romanoff and Stark's bodyguard <a href="/wiki/Happy_Hogan_(comics)" title="Happy Hogan (comics)">Happy Hogan</a> go after Vanko at Hammer's factory. Vanko escapes, but Romanoff returns control of the Rhodes' armor. Stark and Rhodes together defeat Vanko and his drones. Vanko commits <a href="/wiki/Suicide" title="Suicide">suicide</a> by blowing up his suit, along with the defeated drones.
</p><p>At a debriefing, Fury informs Stark that because of Stark's difficult personality, S.H.I.E.L.D. intends to use him only as a consultant. Stark and Rhodes receive medals for their heroism.

After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded by a rocket-propelled grenade used by the attackers: one of his company's own. He is captured and imprisoned in a cave by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings; <a href="/wiki/Ho_Yinsen" title="Ho Yinsen">Yinsen</a>, a fellow captive who is a doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep the shrapnel shards that wounded him from reaching his heart and killing him. Ten Rings leader <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Raza_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Raza (Marvel Comics)">Raza</a> offers Stark freedom in exchange for building a Jericho missile for the group, but Tony and Yinsen know that Raza will not keep his word.
</p><p>Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a prototypical <a href="/wiki/Iron_Man%27s_armor_in_other_media#Live_action" title="Iron Man's armor in other media">suit of powered armor</a> to aid in their escape. Although they keep the suit hidden almost to completion, the Ten Rings discover their hostages' intentions and attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert and destroying the suit. After being rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home and announces that his company will no longer manufacture weapons. <a href="/wiki/Iron_Monger" title="Iron Monger">Obadiah Stane</a>, his father's old partner and the company's manager, advises Stark that this may ruin Stark Industries and his father's legacy. In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor for his chest. Personal assistant <a href="/wiki/Pepper_Potts" title="Pepper Potts">Pepper Potts</a> places the original reactor inside a small glass showcase. Though Stane requests details, a suspicious Stark decides to keep his work to himself.
</p><p>At a charity event held by Stark Industries, reporter <a href="/wiki/Christine_Everhart" title="Christine Everhart">Christine Everhart</a> informs Stark that his company's weapons were recently delivered to the Ten Rings and are being used to attack Yinsen's home village, Gulmira. Stark then learns that Stane has been <a href="/wiki/Arms_trafficking" title="Arms trafficking">arms trafficking</a> to criminals worldwide and is staging a <a href="/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat" title="Coup d'état">coup</a> to replace him as Stark Industries' CEO. Stark dons his new armor and flies to Afghanistan, where he saves the villagers. While flying home, Stark is shot at by two <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/F-22_Raptor" title="F-22 Raptor">F-22 Raptor</a> fighter jets. He reveals his secret identity to Rhodes over the phone in an attempt to end the attack. Meanwhile, the Ten Rings gather the pieces of Stark's prototype suit and meet with Stane, who subdues Raza and has the rest of the group killed. Stane has a massive new suit <a href="/wiki/Reverse_engineering" title="Reverse engineering">reverse engineered</a> from the wreckage. Seeking to track his company's illegal shipments, Stark sends Potts to hack into its database. She discovers that Stane hired the Ten Rings to kill Stark, but the group reneged.

</p><p>Stane's scientists cannot duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the one from his chest. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building, and Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him. The next day, at a press conference, Stark defies suggestions from S.H.I.E.L.D. and publicly admits to being "Iron Man."

Spock contacts his older self, who warns that Khan is ruthless and untrustworthy and that Khan's older self was only defeated at a terrible cost. After capturing the bridge, Khan overpowers Kirk, Scott and Carol, kills Marcus, and takes control of <i>Vengeance</i>.
</p><p>Khan demands that Spock return his crew in exchange for the <i>Enterprise</i> officers. Spock complies but surreptitiously removes Khan's frozen crew from the torpedoes and arms the warheads. Khan beams Kirk, Scott and Carol aboard <i>Enterprise</i>, but betrays their agreement by attacking <i>Enterprise</i>; however, <i>Vengeance</i> is disabled when the torpedoes detonate. With both starships caught in Earth's gravity, they plummet toward the surface. Kirk enters the radioactive reactor chamber to realign the warp core, sacrificing himself to save the ship.
</p><p>Khan crashes the <i>Vengeance</i> into downtown <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> in an attempt to destroy Starfleet headquarters. Khan escapes the wreckage so Spock transports down in pursuit. McCoy discovers that Khan's blood has regenerative properties that may save Kirk.

</p><p>Seventeen years later on the planet <a href="/wiki/Vulcan_(Star_Trek)#Homeworld" title="Vulcan (Star Trek)">Vulcan</a>, a young Spock is accepted to join the Vulcan Science Academy. Realizing that the Academy views his human mother Amanda as a "disadvantage", he joins <a href="/wiki/Starfleet" title="Starfleet">Starfleet</a> instead. On <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>, Kirk becomes a reckless but intelligent young adult.

</p><p>Three years later, Commander Spock accuses Kirk of cheating during the <i><a href="/wiki/Kobayashi_Maru" title="Kobayashi Maru">Kobayashi Maru</a></i> simulation. Kirk argues that cheating was acceptable because the simulation was designed to be unbeatable. The disciplinary hearing is interrupted by a distress signal from Vulcan. With the primary fleet out of range, the cadets are mobilized. McCoy and Kirk board Pike's ship, the <a href="/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701)" title="USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)"><i>Enterprise</i></a>. Realizing that the "lightning storm" observed near Vulcan is similar to the one that occurred when he was born, Kirk breaks protocol to convince Pike that the distress signal is a trap.
</p><p><i>Enterprise</i> arrives to find the fleet destroyed and <i>Narada</i> drilling into Vulcan's <a href="/wiki/Planetary_core" title="Planetary core">core</a>. <i>Narada</i> attacks <i>Enterprise</i> and Pike surrenders, delegating command of the ship to Spock and promoting Kirk to first officer.

Olson is killed but Kirk and Sulu disable the drill. Despite their efforts, Nero launches "red matter" into Vulcan's core, forming an artificial <a href="/wiki/Black_hole" title="Black hole">black hole</a> that destroys Vulcan. Spock rescues the high council and his father <a href="/wiki/Sarek" title="Sarek">Sarek</a>, but his mother Amanda dies.
</p><p>As <i>Narada</i> moves toward Earth, Nero tortures Pike to gain access to Earth's defense codes. Spock maroons Kirk on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Delta_Vega" title="Delta Vega">Delta Vega</a> after Kirk attempts <a href="/wiki/Mutiny" title="Mutiny">mutiny</a>. Kirk encounters an older Spock, who explains that he and Nero are from 129 years in the future. In that future, <a href="/wiki/Romulan#Romulus" title="Romulan">Romulus</a> was threatened by a <a href="/wiki/Supernova" title="Supernova">supernova</a>. Spock's attempt to use "red matter" to create an artificial black hole and consume the supernova failed, and Nero's family perished along with Romulus. <i>Narada</i> and Spock's vessel were caught in the black hole, sending them back in time. Nero stranded Spock on Delta Vega to watch Vulcan's destruction.
</p><p>Reaching a Starfleet outpost on Delta Vega, Kirk and the elder Spock meet <a href="/wiki/Scotty_(Star_Trek)" title="Scotty (Star Trek)">Montgomery Scott</a>. With the elder Spock's help, Scott devises a way for Kirk to <a href="/wiki/Transporter_(Star_Trek)" title="Transporter (Star Trek)">beam</a> onto <i>Enterprise</i> while it is travelling at Warp speed. Following the elder Spock's advice, Kirk provokes younger Spock into attacking him, forcing Spock to recognize himself as emotionally compromised and relinquish command to Kirk. After talking with Sarek, Spock decides to help Kirk. While <i>Enterprise</i> hides itself within the gas clouds of <a href="/wiki/Titan_(moon)" title="Titan (moon)">Titan</a>, Kirk and Spock beam aboard <i>Narada</i>. Kirk fights with Nero and Ayel, killing the latter and rescuing Pike, while Spock uses the elder Spock's ship to destroy the drill. Spock leads <i>Narada</i> away from Earth and sets his ship to collide with Nero's ship. <i>Enterprise</i> beams Kirk, Pike, and Spock aboard. The older Spock's ship and <i>Narada</i> collide, igniting the "red matter". Kirk offers Nero help to escape, but Nero refuses, prompting Kirk to give the order to fire, dooming <i>Narada</i> to be consumed in a black hole.
</p><p>Kirk is promoted to Captain and given command of <i>Enterprise</i> while Pike is promoted to Rear Admiral. Spock encounters his older self, who persuades his younger self to continue serving in Starfleet, encouraging him to do, for once, what feels right instead of what is logical. Spock remains in Starfleet, becoming first officer under Kirk's command. <i>Enterprise</i> goes to warp as the elder Spock speaks the "<a href="/wiki/Where_no_man_has_gone_before" title="Where no man has gone before">where no one has gone before</a>" monologue.
</p><p>Three years into its mission, the <a href="/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701)" title="USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)">USS <i>Enterprise</i></a> arrives at <i>Yorktown</i>, a massive space station, for resupply and <a href="/wiki/Shore_leave" title="Shore leave">shore leave</a> for its crew. Struggling to find meaning in their endless exploration, Captain <a href="/wiki/James_T._Kirk" title="James T. Kirk">James T.

Meanwhile, <a href="/wiki/Hikaru_Sulu" title="Hikaru Sulu">Hikaru Sulu</a> reunites with his family, <a href="/wiki/Scotty_(Star_Trek)" title="Scotty (Star Trek)">Montgomery Scott</a> works to keep the ship operational, and Spock and <a href="/wiki/Uhura" title="Uhura">Nyota Uhura</a> amicably end their relationship; Spock also receives word from New Vulcan that Ambassador Spock, his counterpart from the original timeline, has died.
</p><p>The <i>Enterprise</i> is sent on a rescue mission after an escape pod drifts out of a nearby uncharted nebula. Its occupant, Kalara, claims her ship is stranded on Altamid, a planet in the nebula. As the <i>Enterprise</i> exits an asteroid field within the nebula, a massive swarm of small ships ambushes and quickly overwhelms the starship, severing the ship's <a href="/wiki/Warp_drive" title="Warp drive">warp nacelles</a> in a matter of seconds. The swarm's leader, Krall, and his crew board the crippled <i>Enterprise</i>, capture and kill many crew members, and recover a relic, the Abronath, that Kirk had recently obtained. Scotty manages to restore enough power for the ship to attempt to flee, but Krall orders his swarm to destroy the <i>Enterprise</i>, and they smash the ship in half. Kirk, having recovered the Abronath, orders the crew to abandon ship, leaving the remains of the <i>Enterprise</i> to crash on Altamid.
</p><p>On the planet, Krall captures Sulu, Uhura and other survivors. Kirk and <a href="/wiki/Pavel_Chekov" title="Pavel Chekov">Pavel Chekov</a>, accompanied by Kalara, locate the <i>Enterprise</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s saucer section. Realising that Kalara knew they would be attacked, they trick her into revealing herself as Krall's spy. To escape Krall's soldiers, Kirk and Chekov use the ship's thrusters to flip the saucer over, and Kalara is killed in the maneuver. Elsewhere on the planet, Dr. <a href="/wiki/Leonard_McCoy" title="Leonard McCoy">Leonard McCoy</a> and a wounded Spock search for other survivors. Spock explains to McCoy that the tension he witnessed between him and Uhura at <i>Yorktown</i> was due to his intention to leave <a href="/wiki/Starfleet" title="Starfleet">Starfleet</a> to help the Vulcan survivors, and continue the late Ambassador Spock's work. Jaylah, a scavenger who previously escaped Krall's encampment where her father was killed, rescues Scott and takes him to her makeshift home, the grounded <a href="/wiki/USS_Franklin_(NX-326)" title="USS Franklin (NX-326)">USS <i>Franklin</i></a>, an early Starfleet vessel reported missing over a century earlier. Scott is reunited with Kirk, Chekov, McCoy and Spock. Threatening to kill the crew, Krall coerces Ensign Syl to hand over the Abronath that she had concealed for Kirk, then uses it on her to demonstrate an ancient <a href="/wiki/Biological_agent" title="Biological agent">bioweapon</a> that can disintegrate any humanoid. With the device complete, Krall intends to kill <i>Yorktown</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s inhabitants, then use the base to attack the <a href="/wiki/United_Federation_of_Planets" title="United Federation of Planets">Federation</a>. Kirk and the others free the crew as Krall launches into space with the bioweapon, leading his drones to <i>Yorktown</i>.
</p><p>As the <i>Enterprise</i> survivors power up the <i>Franklin</i> and launch her in pursuit of Krall, they deduce that such a massive swarm must coordinate its attacks via radio signals, specifically in the VHF frequency band. Scott transports Spock and McCoy into one of the swarm ships to seize control of it. Matching the swarm's frequency, they jam and disorient the swarm by broadcasting the 1994 song "<a href="/wiki/Sabotage_(song)" title="Sabotage (song)">Sabotage</a>" by the <a href="/wiki/Beastie_Boys" title="Beastie Boys">Beastie Boys</a>, destroying almost the entire fleet. Krall and his three surviving ships, one of which contains Spock and McCoy, are chased by the <i>Franklin</i> through <i>Yorktown</i>. The chase ends at the station's headquarters,  where the <i>Franklin</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s sudden appearance causes the three ships to smash into it. As Krall flees into the starbase, Uhura and Kirk discover from the <i>Franklin</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s logs that he is actually Balthazar Edison, former captain of the <i>Franklin</i>. A pre-Federation human soldier, Edison rejected the Federation's principles of unity and cooperation with former enemies like the <a href="/wiki/Xindi_(Star_Trek)" title="Xindi (Star Trek)">Xindi</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Romulan_(Star_Trek)" title="Romulan (Star Trek)">Romulans</a>. When he and his crew were stranded on Altamid by a wormhole, the three survivors used the extinct natives' technology to prolong their lives at the cost of the others, and re-purposed the ancient race's dormant drone workers into the swarm. Thinking the Federation had abandoned them, Edison planned to destroy the Federation and resume galactic conflict. Kirk pursues Edison into <i>Yorktown</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s ventilation system, where Edison activates the bioweapon. Before it can spread, Kirk ejects it and Edison into space, where the weapon kills Edison. Using the alien ship they commandeered, Spock and McCoy save Kirk moments before he is also blown into space.
</p><p>In the aftermath, Commodore Paris closes the files of Captain Edison and the USS <i>Franklin</i> crew. Kirk decides to keep his position as the <i>Enterprise</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s captain; Spock chooses to remain in Starfleet, and begins to renew his relationship with Uhura. On Kirk's recommendation, Jaylah is accepted into <a href="/wiki/Starfleet_Academy" title="Starfleet Academy">Starfleet Academy</a>. As the crew celebrates Kirk's birthday, they watch the construction of their new ship, the <a href="/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-A)" title="USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A)">USS <i>Enterprise</i>-A</a>—and when the ship is completed, they resume their mission.
</p><p>In 2271, a <a href="/wiki/Starfleet" title="Starfleet">Starfleet</a> monitoring station, <i>Epsilon Nine</i>, detects an alien force, hidden in a massive cloud of energy, moving through space toward Earth. The cloud easily destroys three of the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Klingon_Empire" title="Klingon Empire">Klingon Empire</a>'s new <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/K%27t%27inga_class" title="K't'inga class"><i>K't'inga</i>-class</a> warships and the monitoring station en route. On Earth, the starship <i><a href="/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701)" title="USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)">Enterprise</a></i> is undergoing a major refit; its former commanding officer, <a href="/wiki/James_T._Kirk" title="James T. Kirk">James T. Kirk</a>, has been promoted to Admiral and works in <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco" title="San Francisco">San Francisco</a> as Chief of Starfleet Operations. Starfleet dispatches <i>Enterprise</i> to investigate the cloud entity as the ship is the only one in intercept range, requiring its new systems to be tested in transit.
</p><p>Citing his experience, Kirk takes command of the ship, angering Captain <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Willard_Decker" title="Willard Decker">Willard Decker</a>, who had been overseeing the refit as its new commanding officer. Testing of <i>Enterprise</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s new systems goes poorly; two officers, including the Vulcan <i>Enterprise</i> science officer <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sonak" title="Sonak">Sonak</a>, are killed by a malfunctioning <a href="/wiki/Transporter_(Star_Trek)" title="Transporter (Star Trek)">transporter</a>, and improperly calibrated engines nearly destroy the <i>Enterprise</i>. Kirk's unfamiliarity with the ship's new systems increases the tension between him and Decker, who has been temporarily demoted to first officer. Commander <a href="/wiki/Spock" title="Spock">Spock</a> arrives as a replacement science officer, explaining that while on his home world undergoing a ritual to purge all emotion, he felt a consciousness that he believes emanates from the cloud, and was unable to complete the ritual because his human half felt an emotional connection to it.
</p><p><i>Enterprise</i> intercepts the energy cloud and is attacked by an alien vessel within. A probe appears on the bridge, attacks Spock and abducts the navigator, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ilia_(Star_Trek)" title="Ilia (Star Trek)">Ilia</a>. She is replaced by a robotic <a href="/wiki/Replica" title="Replica">replica</a>, another probe sent by "V'Ger" to study the crew. Decker is distraught over the loss of Ilia, with whom he had a romantic history. He becomes troubled as he attempts to extract information from the doppelgänger, which has Ilia's memories and feelings buried inside. Spock takes a spacewalk to the alien vessel's interior and attempts a telepathic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vulcan_mind_meld" title="Vulcan mind meld">mind meld</a> with it. In doing so, he learns that the vessel is V'Ger itself, a living machine.
</p><p>At the center of the massive ship, V'Ger is revealed to be <i><a href="/wiki/Voyager_program#In_popular_culture" title="Voyager program">Voyager 6</a></i>, a 20th-century Earth space probe believed lost in a black hole. The damaged probe was found by an alien race of living machines that interpreted its programming as instructions to learn all that can be learned and return that information to its creator. The machines upgraded the probe to fulfill its mission, and on its journey, the probe gathered so much knowledge that it achieved consciousness. Spock realizes that V'Ger lacks the ability to give itself a purpose other than its original mission; having learned what it could on its journey home, it finds its existence meaningless. Before transmitting all its information, V'Ger insists that the Creator come in person to finish the sequence. Everyone realizes humans are the Creator.  Decker offers himself to V'Ger; he merges with the Ilia probe and V'Ger, creating a new form of life that disappears into another dimension. With Earth saved, Kirk directs <i>Enterprise</i> out to space for future missions.
</p><p>In 2286, an enormous cylindrical probe moves through space, sending out an indecipherable signal and disabling the power of every ship it passes. As it takes up orbit around Earth, its signal disables the global power grid and generates planetary storms, creating catastrophic, sun-blocking cloud cover. <a href="/wiki/Starfleet" title="Starfleet">Starfleet</a> Command sends out a planetary <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Distress_call" title="Distress call">distress call</a> and warns all space-faring vessels not to approach Earth.
</p><p>On the planet <a href="/wiki/Vulcan_(Star_Trek)#Homeworld" title="Vulcan (Star Trek)">Vulcan</a>, the former officers of the late <a href="/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701)" title="USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)">USS <i>Enterprise</i></a> are living in exile (following the events of <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Trek_III:_The_Search_for_Spock" title="Star Trek III: The Search for Spock">Star Trek III: The Search for Spock</a></i>). Accompanied by the Vulcan <a href="/wiki/Spock" title="Spock">Spock</a>, still recovering from his resurrection, the crew — except for Saavik, who remains on Vulcan — take their captured Klingon Bird of Prey (renamed the <i>Bounty</i>, after the <a href="/wiki/HMS_Bounty" title="HMS Bounty">Royal Navy ship</a>) and return to Earth to face trial for their actions. Receiving Starfleet's warning, Spock determines that the probe's signal matches the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Whale_sound" title="Whale sound">song</a> of extinct <a href="/wiki/Humpback_whale" title="Humpback whale">humpback whales</a>, and that the object will continue to wreak havoc until its call is answered. The crew uses their ship to <a href="/wiki/Time_travel_in_fiction" title="Time travel in fiction">travel back in time</a> via a <a href="/wiki/Gravity_assist" title="Gravity assist">slingshot maneuver around the Sun</a>, planning to return with a whale to answer the alien signal.
</p><p>Arriving in 1986, the crew finds their ship's power drained by the time travel maneuver.

</p><p>Kirk and Spock discover a pair of whales in the care of Dr. Gillian Taylor at a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sausalito" title="Sausalito">Sausalito</a> aquarium, and learn they will soon be released into the wild. Kirk tells her of his mission and asks for the tracking frequency for the whales, but she refuses to cooperate. Meanwhile, Scott, McCoy, and Sulu trade the formula of <a href="/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_materials#Transparent_aluminum" title="List of Star Trek materials">transparent aluminum</a> for the materials needed for the whale tank. Uhura and Chekov locate a nuclear powered ship, the <a href="/wiki/Aircraft_carrier" title="Aircraft carrier">aircraft carrier</a> <i><a href="/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(CVN-65)" title="USS Enterprise (CVN-65)">Enterprise</a></i>. They collect the power they need, but are discovered on board. Uhura is beamed out but Chekov is captured, and subsequently severely injured in an escape attempt.
</p><p>Gillian learns the whales have been released early, and goes to Kirk for assistance. Gillian, Kirk, and McCoy rescue Chekov from a nearby hospital and return to the now recharged Bird of Prey. After saving the whales from poachers and transporting them aboard, the crew returns with Gillian to their own time. On approaching Earth, the <i>Bounty</i> loses power due to the alien probe, and crash-lands into the waters of <a href="/wiki/San_Francisco_Bay" title="San Francisco Bay">San Francisco Bay</a>. Once released from near-drowning, the whales respond to the probe's signal, causing the object to reverse its effects on Earth and return to the depths of space. For their part in saving the planet, all charges against the <i>Enterprise</i> crew are dropped, save one for disobeying a superior officer, leveled solely at Kirk. Kirk is demoted from Admiral to the rank of Captain and returned to the command of a starship. Kirk and Gillian part ways, as she has been assigned to a science vessel by Starfleet. The crew departs on their ship, the newly christened <a href="/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-A)" title="USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-A)">USS <i>Enterprise</i> (NCC-1701-A)</a>, and leaves on a shakedown mission.

</p><p><i>Enterprise</i> and Gorkon's battlecruiser rendezvous and continue towards Earth, with the two command crews sharing a tense meal aboard <i>Enterprise</i>. Later that night, <i>Enterprise</i> appears to fire torpedoes at the Klingon ship, disabling its <a href="/wiki/Artificial_gravity" title="Artificial gravity">artificial gravity</a>. During the confusion, two figures wearing Starfleet spacesuits beam aboard the Klingon ship and grievously wound Gorkon before escaping. Kirk surrenders to avoid armed conflict, and beams aboard the Klingon ship with Doctor <a href="/wiki/Leonard_McCoy" title="Leonard McCoy">Leonard McCoy</a> to attempt to save Gorkon's life. The chancellor dies, and Gorkon's chief of staff, <a href="/wiki/Chang_(Star_Trek)" title="Chang (Star Trek)">General Chang</a>, arrests and tries Kirk and McCoy for his assassination.

Gorkon's daughter Azetbur becomes the new chancellor, and continues diplomatic negotiations; for reasons of security, the conference is relocated and the new location is kept secret. While several senior Starfleet officers want to rescue Kirk and McCoy, the Federation President refuses to risk full-scale war. Azetbur likewise refuses to invade Federation space.
</p><p>Kirk and McCoy arrive at the Rura Penthe mines and are befriended by a <a href="/wiki/Shapeshifting" title="Shapeshifting">shapeshifter</a> named Martia, who offers them an escape route; in reality, it is a ruse to make their arranged deaths appear accidental. Once her betrayal is revealed, Martia transforms into Kirk's double and fights him, but is killed by the prison guards to silence any witnesses. Kirk and McCoy are beamed aboard <i>Enterprise</i> by Captain <a href="/wiki/Spock" title="Spock">Spock</a>, who had assumed command and undertaken an investigation in Kirk's absence. Determining that <i>Enterprise</i> did not fire the torpedoes but that the assassins are still aboard, the crew has begun a search for them.

The simulation is a no-win scenario designed to test the character of <a href="/wiki/Starfleet" title="Starfleet">Starfleet</a> officers. Later, Dr. McCoy joins Kirk on his birthday; seeing Kirk in low spirits, the doctor advises Kirk to get a new command and not grow old behind a desk.

Fifteen years prior (see "<a href="/wiki/Space_Seed" title="Space Seed">Space Seed</a>"), the <i>Enterprise</i> discovered Khan's ship adrift in space; Kirk exiled Khan and his fellow supermen to Ceti Alpha V after they attempted to take over the <i>Enterprise</i>. After they were marooned, Ceti Alpha VI exploded, shifting the orbit of Ceti Alpha V and destroying its ecosystem. Khan blames Kirk for the death of his wife and plans revenge. He implants Chekov and Terrell with indigenous creatures that enter the ears of their victims and render them susceptible to mind control, and uses the officers to capture the <i>Reliant</i>. Learning of Genesis, Khan attacks space station <i>Regula I</i> where the device is being developed by Kirk's former lover, Dr. <a href="/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_characters_(G%E2%80%93M)#M" title="List of Star Trek characters (G–M)">Carol Marcus</a>, and their son, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_characters_(G%E2%80%93M)#M" title="List of Star Trek characters (G–M)">David</a>.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-st-plot_5-0"><a href="#cite_note-st-plot-5">[5]</a></sup>
</p><p>The <i>Enterprise</i> embarks on a three-week training voyage. Kirk assumes command after the ship receives a distress call from <i>Regula I</i>. En route, the <i>Enterprise</i> is ambushed and crippled by the <i>Reliant</i>, leading to the deaths and injuries of many trainees. Khan hails the <i>Enterprise</i> and offers to spare Kirk's crew if they relinquish all material related to Genesis. Kirk stalls for time and uses the <i>Reliant'</i>s prefix code to remotely lower its <a href="/wiki/Shields_(Star_Trek)" title="Shields (Star Trek)">shields</a>, allowing the <i>Enterprise</i> to counter-attack. Khan is forced to retreat and effect repairs, while the <i>Enterprise</i> limps to <i>Regula I</i>. Kirk, McCoy, and Saavik beam to the station and find Terrell and Chekov alive, along with slaughtered members of Marcus's team. They soon find Carol and David hiding deep inside the planetoid of Regula. Khan, having used Terrell and Chekov as spies, orders them to kill Kirk; Terrell resists the eel's influence and kills himself while Chekov collapses as the eel leaves his body. Khan then transports Genesis aboard the <i>Reliant</i>. Though Khan believes his foe stranded on <i>Regula I</i>, Kirk and Spock use a coded message to arrange a rendezvous. Kirk directs the <i>Enterprise</i> into the nearby Mutara Nebula; static discharges inside the nebula render shields useless and compromise targeting systems, making the <i>Enterprise</i> and the <i>Reliant</i> evenly matched. Spock notes that Khan's tactics are two-dimensional, indicating inexperience in space combat, which Kirk then exploits to critically disable the <i>Reliant</i>.
</p><p>Mortally wounded, Khan activates Genesis, which will reorganize all matter in the nebula, including the <i>Enterprise</i>. Though Kirk's crew detects the activation of Genesis and attempts to move out of range, they will not be able to escape the nebula in time due to the ship's damaged <a href="/wiki/Warp_drive" title="Warp drive">warp drive</a>. Spock goes to the engine room to restore the warp drive. When McCoy tries to prevent Spock's entry, as exposure to the high levels of radiation would be fatal, Spock incapacitates the doctor with a <a href="/wiki/Vulcan_nerve_pinch" title="Vulcan nerve pinch">Vulcan nerve pinch</a> and performs a <a href="/wiki/Vulcan_(Star_Trek)#Mind_melds" title="Vulcan (Star Trek)">mind meld</a>, telling him to "remember". Spock successfully restores power to the warp drive, and the <i>Enterprise</i> escapes the explosion. The explosion of Genesis causes the gas in the nebula to reform into a new planet, capable of sustaining life.
</p><p>After being alerted by McCoy, Kirk arrives in the engine room. Before dying of <a href="/wiki/Acute_radiation_syndrome" title="Acute radiation syndrome">radiation poisoning</a>, Spock urges Kirk not to grieve, as his decision to sacrifice himself to save the ship's crew is a logical one.

Discovering an unexpected life form on the surface, Marcus and Saavik transport to the planet. They find that the Genesis Device has resurrected Spock in the form of a child, although his mind is not present. Marcus admits that he used unstable "protomatter" in the development of the Genesis Device, causing Spock to age rapidly and meaning the planet will be destroyed within hours. Meanwhile, Kruge (<a href="/wiki/Christopher_Lloyd" title="Christopher Lloyd">Christopher Lloyd</a>), the commander of a <a href="/wiki/Klingon" title="Klingon">Klingon</a> vessel, intercepts information about Genesis.

Spock's <i>katra</i> and body are needed to lay him to rest on his homeworld, Vulcan, and without help, McCoy will die from carrying the <i>katra</i>. Disobeying orders, Kirk and his officers spring McCoy from detention, disable the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/USS_Excelsior_(Star_Trek)" title="USS Excelsior (Star Trek)">USS <i>Excelsior</i></a>, and steal the <i>Enterprise</i> from Spacedock to return to the Genesis planet to retrieve Spock's body.

Only Spock and Kirk prove resistant to Sybok; Spock is unmoved by the experience and Kirk refuses the Vulcan's offer, telling him that his pain is necessary to make him human. Sybok reluctantly declares a truce with Kirk, realizing he needs his leadership experience to navigate <i>Enterprise</i> to Sha Ka Ree.
</p><p>The ship successfully breaches the barrier, pursued by Klaa's vessel, and discovers a lone blue planet. Sybok, Kirk, Spock, and McCoy beam down to the surface, where Sybok calls out to his perceived vision of God. An entity appears, initially bearing a large human face, and when told of how Sybok breached the barrier, demands that the starship be brought closer to the planet. When a skeptical Kirk asks, "What does God need with a starship?", the entity attacks him in retribution. The others doubt a god who would inflict harm on people for pleasure.
</p><p>Realizing his foolishness, Sybok sacrifices himself in an effort to combat the creature and allow the others to escape. Intent on stopping the being, Kirk orders <i>Enterprise</i> to fire a <a href="/wiki/Weapons_in_Star_Trek" title="Weapons in Star Trek">photon torpedo</a> at their location, to little effect. Spock and McCoy are beamed back to the ship, but Klaa's vessel attacks <i>Enterprise</i> before Kirk can be transported aboard.

Captain <a href="/wiki/Jean-Luc_Picard" title="Jean-Luc Picard">Jean-Luc Picard</a> receives a message from Earth that his brother and nephew were killed in a fire. Since Picard never fathered children of his own, he is distracted by the knowledge that the family line will end with him. <i>Enterprise</i> receives a distress call from an observatory in the Amargosa star system, where they rescue an El-Aurian named Dr. Tolian Soran, who is eager to return to complete his research. <a href="/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)" title="Data (Star Trek)">Data</a> and <a href="/wiki/Geordi_La_Forge" title="Geordi La Forge">Geordi La Forge</a> discover a compound called trilithium on board the observatory.

Soran and La Forge are transported away by a <a href="/wiki/Klingon_starships#Bird_of_Prey_classes" title="Klingon starships">Klingon Bird of Prey</a> belonging to the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation_characters#Lursa_and_B'Etor" title="List of Star Trek: The Next Generation characters">Duras sisters</a>, in league with Soran. Data is rescued just before the station is destroyed by the shock wave, and <i>Enterprise</i> warps away from the system.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Guinan_(Star_Trek)" title="Guinan (Star Trek)">Guinan</a> tells Picard more about Soran; they were among the El-Aurians rescued by the <i>Enterprise</i>-B in 2293. Guinan explains that Soran is obsessed with reentering the ribbon, which is a portal to the "Nexus", an extra-dimensional realm that exists outside of normal space-time. Picard and Data determine that Soran, unable to fly a ship into the ribbon, is instead altering the path of the ribbon by destroying stars, and plans to bring the ribbon to him on the planet Veridian III by destroying its sun. As a neighboring planet in that system is host to millions, Picard orders the <i>Enterprise</i> there at maximum warp.
</p><p>Upon entering the Veridian system, <i>Enterprise</i> makes contact with the Duras Bird of Prey. Picard offers himself to the sisters in exchange for La Forge, but insists that he be transported to Soran first to reason with him. La Forge is returned to <i>Enterprise</i>, but with his VISOR under surveillance by the Klingons. This causes him to inadvertently reveal <i>Enterprise</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s shield frequency, allowing the Duras sisters to fire weapons directly through them and inflict crippling damage. <i>Enterprise</i> destroys the Bird of Prey, but has sustained irreversible damage to its warp core. Commander <a href="/wiki/William_Riker" title="William Riker">William Riker</a> orders an evacuation to the forward saucer section of the ship, which separates from the engineering section. The shock wave from the warp core's detonation sends the saucer crashing to the surface of Veridian III.
</p><p>Picard fails to talk Soran out of his plan and is too late to stop him from launching his missile. The collapse of the Veridian star alters the course of the Nexus ribbon as predicted, and sweeps Picard and Soran away while the resulting shock wave obliterates everything in the system. In the Nexus, Picard finds himself surrounded by an idealised family, but realizes it is an illusion. He is confronted by an "echo" of Guinan, and after being told that he may go wherever and <i>whenever</i> he wishes within the Nexus, Guinan sends him to meet Captain Kirk, also safe in the Nexus. Though Kirk is at first wrapped up in the illusion, he likewise realizes that nothing in the Nexus is real, and therefore does not matter. Picard convinces Kirk to leave the Nexus for Veridian III to help him stop Soran. 
</p><p>Kirk and Picard arrive on Veridian III only minutes before Soran launched the missile. Working together, they distract Soran long enough for Picard to lock the missile in place, causing it to explode on the launchpad and kill Soran. Kirk is fatally injured in the effort; he dies knowing he helped to make the difference. Picard buries Kirk on a mountainside, before a shuttle arrives to transport him to the <i>Enterprise</i> wreckage. Three Federation starships arrive to retrieve <i>Enterprise</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s survivors.

Admiral Matthew Dougherty (<a href="/wiki/Anthony_Zerbe" title="Anthony Zerbe">Anthony Zerbe</a>) contacts the <a href="/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-E)" title="USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)">USS <i>Enterprise</i>-E</a> to obtain Data's schematics but adamantly states the presence of the <i>Enterprise</i> is not needed. Captain Picard decides to ignore these orders and takes the <i>Enterprise</i> to capture Data.  After stopping Data, Captain <a href="/wiki/Jean-Luc_Picard" title="Jean-Luc Picard">Jean-Luc Picard</a> (<a href="/wiki/Patrick_Stewart" title="Patrick Stewart">Patrick Stewart</a>) becomes suspicious of Dougherty's insistence that the <i>Enterprise</i> is no longer needed. His crew investigates the cause of Data's malfunction. They discover that the Ba'ku have advanced technology, but have rejected its use to live simpler lives. Due to unique radiation or "metaphasic particles" emanating from their planet's rings, they are effectively immortal. Dougherty's allies, the Son'a, are a decrepit race who use medical techniques to prevent death; their excessive use of <a href="/wiki/Rhytidectomy" title="Rhytidectomy">cosmetic surgery</a> gives them a mummified appearance. The <i>Enterprise</i> crew also begin to experience the rejuvenation effects of the planet: Lt. Commander <a href="/wiki/Geordi_La_Forge" title="Geordi La Forge">Geordi La Forge</a> (<a href="/wiki/LeVar_Burton" title="LeVar Burton">LeVar Burton</a>) finds his eyes have regenerated and he no longer requires ocular implants; Commander <a href="/wiki/William_Riker" title="William Riker">William Riker</a> (<a href="/wiki/Jonathan_Frakes" title="Jonathan Frakes">Jonathan Frakes</a>) and Counselor <a href="/wiki/Deanna_Troi" title="Deanna Troi">Deanna Troi</a> (<a href="/wiki/Marina_Sirtis" title="Marina Sirtis">Marina Sirtis</a>) rekindle their long-abandoned relationship; and Picard develops a romantic relationship with the Ba'ku woman Anij (<a href="/wiki/Donna_Murphy" title="Donna Murphy">Donna Murphy</a>).
</p><p>Data and Picard discover a submerged and cloaked Federation ship containing a gigantic <a href="/wiki/Holodeck" title="Holodeck">holodeck</a> set up to recreate the Ba'ku village. Data's malfunction stems from a Son'a attack, received when he discovered the vessel. Picard confronts Dougherty and learns that top Federation officers and the Son'a secretly planned to deceptively move the Ba'ku to the ship and forcibly relocate them to another planet, allowing the Son'a to collect the rejuvenating radiation (but poisoning the planet in the process). Dougherty orders the <i>Enterprise</i> to leave. Picard states the rejuvenation benefit of the radiation does not justify Dougherty's plans for the Ba'ku and violates the <a href="/wiki/Prime_Directive" title="Prime Directive">Prime Directive</a>. He plans to alert the Federation of the forced relocation.
</p><p>Picard is joined by some of his crew to help the Ba'ku escape from being abducted while Riker takes the <i>Enterprise</i> to a transmission range and communicate the violation to Starfleet. The Son'a send robotic probes to locate and capture the fleeing Ba'ku. The Son'a leader, Ahdar Ru'afo (<a href="/wiki/F._Murray_Abraham" title="F. Murray Abraham">F. Murray Abraham</a>), convinces Dougherty to allow two Son'a ships to attack the <i>Enterprise</i>. Riker defeats the attacking ships and the <i>Enterprise</i> escapes. Their plan exposed, Ru'afo insists upon harvesting the radiation source immediately. Picard, Anij, and several Ba'ku are transported as prisoners onto the Son'a ship. Picard reveals to Dougherty that the Son'a and the Ba'ku are the same race, and the Federation is involved in their blood feud. The Son'a are a splinter faction of Ba'ku who gave up their bucolic existence a century earlier to embrace the use of technology. They attempted to seize power but failed, and the Ba'ku elders exiled them from the planet, denying them the rejuvenating effects of the rings. The Son'a developed an artificial and imperfect means to extend their lives at the cost of disfigurement. Ru'afo kills Admiral Dougherty when he backs out of the plan and Ru'afo proceeds with his plan.
</p><p>While Picard is escorted to be executed, he convinces the Son'a Gallatin (<a href="/wiki/Gregg_Henry" title="Gregg Henry">Gregg Henry</a>) to help him stop Ru'afo. Picard masterminds a ruse to transport Ru'afo and his bridge crew to the holoship and shutdown the harvester. Ru'afo discovers the deception and transports to the radiation harvester ship to manually restart the process. Picard follows and sets the harvester to self-destruct, which kills Ru'afo while Picard is rescued by the <i>Enterprise</i>. The remaining Son'a are forgiven and welcomed back by the Ba'ku. Picard arranges a meeting between Gallatin and his Ba'ku mother. The <i>Enterprise</i> crew take a moment to enjoy their rejuvenated selves before returning to their previous mission.
</p><p>On <a href="/wiki/Romulan" title="Romulan">Romulus</a>, members of the Romulan Imperial Senate debate whether to accept the terms of peace and alliance with the <a href="/wiki/Romulan#Remus" title="Romulan">Reman</a> rebel leader <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shinzon" title="Shinzon">Shinzon</a>. The Remans are a slave race of the Romulan Empire, used as miners and as cannon fodder. A faction of the military is in support of Shinzon, but the Praetor and Senate are opposed to an alliance. After rejecting the motion, the Praetor and remaining senators are disintegrated by a device left in the room by a military-aligned senator.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the crew of the <a href="/wiki/USS_Enterprise_(NCC-1701-E)" title="USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)">USS <i>Enterprise</i></a> prepare to bid farewell to first officer Commander <a href="/wiki/William_Riker" title="William Riker">William Riker</a> and Counselor <a href="/wiki/Deanna_Troi" title="Deanna Troi">Deanna Troi</a>, who are being married on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Betazed" title="Betazed">Betazed</a>. En route, they discover a positronic energy reading on a planet in the Kolaran system near the <a href="/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_regions_of_space#Romulan_Neutral_Zone" title="List of Star Trek regions of space">Romulan Neutral Zone</a>. Captain <a href="/wiki/Jean-Luc_Picard" title="Jean-Luc Picard">Jean-Luc Picard</a>, Lieutenant Commander <a href="/wiki/Worf" title="Worf">Worf</a>, and Lieutenant Commander <a href="/wiki/Data_(Star_Trek)" title="Data (Star Trek)">Data</a> land on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/List_of_Star_Trek_planets:_G-L#K" title="List of Star Trek planets: G-L">Kolarus III</a> and discover the remnants of an android resembling Data. When the android is reassembled it introduces itself as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/B-4_(Star_Trek)" title="B-4 (Star Trek)">B-4</a>. The crew deduce it to be a less advanced, early version of Data.
</p><p><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Vice_Admiral_(Star_Trek)" title="Vice Admiral (Star Trek)">Vice Admiral</a> <a href="/wiki/Kathryn_Janeway" title="Kathryn Janeway">Kathryn Janeway</a> contacts Picard and orders the <i>Enterprise</i> on a diplomatic mission to nearby Romulus. Janeway explains that the Romulan Empire has been taken over in a <a href="/wiki/Coup_d%27%C3%A9tat" title="Coup d'état">military coup</a> by Shinzon, who says he wants peace with the <a href="/wiki/United_Federation_of_Planets" title="United Federation of Planets">Federation</a> and to bring freedom to Remus. On arrival, they learn Shinzon is a clone of Picard, secretly created by the Romulans to plant a high-ranking spy into the Federation. The project was abandoned when Shinzon was still a child and he was left on Remus to die as a slave. After many years, Shinzon became a leader of the Remans, and constructed his heavily armed flagship, the <i>Scimitar</i>. Initially, diplomatic efforts go well, but the <i>Enterprise</i> crew discover that the <i>Scimitar</i> is producing low levels of thalaron radiation, which is what had been used to kill the Imperial Senate and is deadly to nearly all life forms. There are also unexpected attempts to communicate with the <i>Enterprise</i> computers, and Shinzon himself violates Troi's mind through the telepathy of his Reman viceroy.
</p><p>Dr. Crusher discovers that Shinzon is aging rapidly because of the process used to clone him, and the only possible means to stop it is a transfusion of Picard's blood. Shinzon kidnaps Picard from the <i>Enterprise</i>, as well as B-4, having planted the android on the nearby planet to lure Picard to the Border. However, Data reveals he has swapped places with B-4, rescues Picard, and returns with Picard to the <i>Enterprise</i>. They have now seen enough of the <i>Scimitar</i> to know that Shinzon plans to use the warship to invade the Federation using its thalaron-radiation generator as a weapon, with the eradication of all life on Earth being his priority.
</p><p>The <i>Enterprise</i> races back to Federation space but is ambushed by the <i>Scimitar</i> in the Bassen Rift, a region that prevents any subspace communications. Two Romulan Warbirds come to the aid of the <i>Enterprise</i>, not wanting to be complicit in Shinzon's plans, but Shinzon destroys one and disables the other. Recognizing the need to stop the <i>Scimitar</i> at all costs, Picard orders the <i>Enterprise</i> to ram it. The collision leaves both ships heavily damaged and destroys most of the <i>Scimitar</i><span class="nowrap" style="padding-left:0.1em;">'</span>s primary weapons. Shinzon orders the <i>Scimitar</i> to back away, then activates the thalaron weapon. Picard boards the <i>Scimitar</i> to face Shinzon alone, and eventually kills him by impaling him on a metal strut. Data jumps the distance between the two ships with a personal transporter to get Picard back to the <i>Enterprise</i> and then sacrifices himself when he fires his phaser at the thalaron generator, destroying the <i>Scimitar</i>. The crew mourn Data, and the surviving Romulan commander offers them her gratitude for saving the Empire.
</p><p>On the <i>Enterprise</i>, now back at Earth drydock for extensive repairs, Picard bids farewell to the newly promoted Captain Riker, who is leaving to command the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/USS_Titan_(NCC-80102)" title="USS Titan (NCC-80102)">USS <i>Titan</i></a> and begin a possible peace negotiation mission with the Romulans. Picard meets with B-4, and discovers that Data had downloaded the <a href="/wiki/Engram_(neuropsychology)" title="Engram (neuropsychology)">engrams</a> of his neural net into B-4's positronic matrix before he boarded the <i>Scimitar</i>. Picard leaves B4's quarters walking down a corridor smiling, knowing that one day, Data will return.
</p><p>Many days after bidding the <a href="/wiki/Ad%C3%A9lie_penguin" title="Adélie penguin">penguins</a> goodbye, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Alex" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Alex</a> the <a href="/wiki/Lion" title="Lion">lion</a> suggests to his friends, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Marty" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Marty</a> the <a href="/wiki/Plains_zebra" title="Plains zebra">zebra</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Melman" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Melman</a> the <a href="/wiki/Reticulated_giraffe" title="Reticulated giraffe">giraffe</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Gloria" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Gloria</a> the <a href="/wiki/Hippopotamus" title="Hippopotamus">hippopotamus</a> and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Lemurs" title="Lemurs">lemurs</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#King_Julien_XIII" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">King Julien XIII</a> the <a href="/wiki/Ring-tailed_lemur" title="Ring-tailed lemur">ring-tailed lemur</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Maurice" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Maurice</a> the <a href="/wiki/Aye-aye" title="Aye-aye">aye-aye</a> and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Mort" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Mort</a> the <a href="/wiki/Goodman%27s_mouse_lemur" title="Goodman's mouse lemur">mouse lemur</a> that they should go to <a href="/wiki/Monte_Carlo" title="Monte Carlo">Monte Carlo</a> to get the penguins and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Common_chimpanzee" title="Common chimpanzee">chimpanzees</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Mason_and_Phil" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Mason and Phil</a> and fly back to New York City, which they agree to do.
</p><p>In Monte Carlo, the penguins and chimpanzees have been saving up their daily winnings from the casino to fly back to Africa and bring their friends home. Alex's interference to kidnap them leads to animal control, led by a vicious big-game hunter and animal control veteran named <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Chantel_DuBois" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Chantel DuBois</a>, pursuing them around the city, with Alex and the gang barely escaping. With determination, DuBois vows to capture Alex and add his head to her collection of animals' heads she's captured.
</p><p>In the skies of <a href="/wiki/France" title="France">France</a>, the plane crashes as the authorities close in. They come across a <a href="/wiki/Circus_train" title="Circus train">circus train</a> consisting of <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Stefano" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Stefano</a> the <a href="/wiki/New_Zealand_sea_lion" title="New Zealand sea lion">sea lion</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Gia" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Gia</a> the <a href="/wiki/North_American_jaguar" title="North American jaguar">jaguar</a>, and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Vitaly" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Vitaly</a> the <a href="/wiki/Siberian_tiger" title="Siberian tiger">tiger</a>, and manage to gain entry, claiming that they are circus animals themselves. The team soon learn from Stefano that they are performing in <a href="/wiki/Rome" title="Rome">Rome</a> and <a href="/wiki/London" title="London">London</a>, where they plan to impress a promoter to get them on their first American tour. Before the zoo animals' claim is discredited, the penguins suddenly appear with a deal to purchase the circus themselves; however, the circus animals' show in Rome proves to be a failure.
</p><p>In route to London, Stefano soon reveals to Alex that Vitaly was the biggest star of them all, but quit due to an accident in one of his stunts; therefore, the friends lost faith in the circus. At a stop in the <a href="/wiki/Alps" title="Alps">Alps</a>, Alex convinces the circus to continue pursuing the circus. Marty finds a new passion in being shot out of a cannon along with Stefano, while Melman and Gloria decide to dance on a tightrope. Gia persuades Alex to teach her Trapeze Americano. In the process, they grow closer and start to fall in love.
</p><p>Meanwhile, DuBois is arrested in Rome while chasing the animals, but swiftly escapes and discovers that Alex was the missing lion from the zoo in New York. Once free, DuBois personally reassembles her injured men and they head toward the Alps, forcing the animals to proceed to London despite incomplete rehearsals. Alex finds Vitaly preparing to leave and convinces him to stay by reminding him of how he enjoys performing the impossible. He suggests that he uses <a href="/wiki/Hair_conditioner" title="Hair conditioner">hair conditioner</a> as a safer lubricant to perform his flaming ring jump as well as fix his damaged fur. As a result, Vitaly's stunt is performed perfectly and the show is a spectacular success. After the impressed promoter arranges for an American tour, DuBois shows up with a paper showing that Alex was missing. Though the penguins are able to foil Dubois' plan, Alex is forced to confess that the four of them are just zoo animals trying to get home, disappointing Gia, Vitaly, Stefano and the other circus animals  who feel used and lied to.
</p><p>The zoo and circus animals go their separate ways but arrive in New York City at the same time. Realizing how much their adventures have changed them, the zoo animals find that their true home was with the circus. Before they can go back, however, DuBois tranquilizes and captures them, before being discovered by the zoo staff, who believe she is responsible for returning the missing animals. King Julien and the penguins manage to get to the circus and convince the circus animals to rescue their friends.
</p><p>Back at the zoo, Alex awakens to find that he along with his friends are trapped in larger fence enclosures. DuBois who was honored by the zoo guards, secretly loads a poison-filled dart into a gun that she hides, inside a foam finger in preparation for publicly executing Alex. Seconds before the poisoned bullet hits Alex, Gia swings in and rescues him. Suddenly, the entire circus arrives in the hot air ballon, frees the zoo animals and defeat DuBois and her henchmen. Alex and his friends eventually decide to permanently join the circus to pursue their adventures, while DuBois and her henchmen are sent off in crates bound for Madagascar (just like the zoo animals themselves were in the <a href="/wiki/Madagascar_(2005_film)" title="Madagascar (2005 film)">first film</a>) thanks to the penguins.

</p><p>Years later, following their adventure in <a href="/wiki/Madagascar" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, the zoo animals—Alex, Marty, Melman, Gloria, the <a href="/wiki/Ad%C3%A9lie_penguin" title="Adélie penguin">penguins</a> <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Skipper" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Skipper</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Kowalski" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Kowalski</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Rico" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Rico</a>, and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Private" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Private</a>, and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Common_chimpanzee" title="Common chimpanzee">chimpanzees</a> <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Mason_and_Phil" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Mason and Phil</a>—prepare to return to New York aboard a battered airplane piloted by the penguins, accompanied by the <a href="/wiki/Lemur" title="Lemur">lemurs</a> <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#King_Julien_XIII" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">King Julien XIII</a> the <a href="/wiki/Ring-tailed_lemur" title="Ring-tailed lemur">ring-tailed lemur</a>, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Maurice" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Maurice</a> the <a href="/wiki/Aye-aye" title="Aye-aye">aye-aye</a>, and <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Mort" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Mort</a> the <a href="/wiki/Goodman%27s_mouse_lemur" title="Goodman's mouse lemur">mouse lemur</a>.

The animals find themselves at a watering hole on a <a href="/wiki/Nature_reserve" title="Nature reserve">nature reserve</a>, and are excited to meet others of their species. Alex is reunited with his parents and impresses them with tales of his status as "the King of New York". Marty fits in with a herd of other zebras who look and sound just like him. Melman, a <a href="/wiki/Hypochondriasis" title="Hypochondriasis">hypochondriac</a>, is distressed that the reserve has no doctors, so the other giraffes appoint him their <a href="/wiki/Witch_doctor" title="Witch doctor">witch doctor</a>. Seeking romance, Gloria attracts the attention of the smooth-talking male hippopotamus, <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Moto_Moto" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Moto Moto</a>.
</p><p>Meanwhile, the penguins set about repairing the plane, assisted by numerous chimpanzees recruited by Mason and Phil. They steal vehicles from several groups of New Yorkers who are on <a href="/wiki/Safari" title="Safari">safari</a> and strip them for parts. <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#Nana" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">Nana</a>, a tough old woman who beat up Alex during the events of <i><a href="/wiki/Madagascar_(2005_film)" title="Madagascar (2005 film)">Madagascar</a></i>, takes charge of the stranded tourists and helps them survive in the wilderness.
</p><p>The zoo animals' excitement soon turns to disappointment. In a scheme to oust Zuba as alpha lion, Makunga insists that Alex complete a <a href="/wiki/Rite_of_passage" title="Rite of passage">rite of passage</a> which Alex mistakes for a talent contest. It is actually a fighting contest, and Makunga tricks him into choosing the strongest lion as his opponent, resulting in Alex's humiliating defeat. Faced with the duty of banishing his son, Zuba relinquishes his title as alpha and Makunga takes over. Meanwhile, Marty is dejected by the realization that the other zebras can do everything he can, believing himself no longer unique. Melman comes to believe that he is deathly ill, and Gloria's interest in Moto Moto saddens him since he has secretly loved her for a long time. The four friends argue heatedly with one another. Gloria has a date with Moto Moto, but loses interest when she realizes he is only attracted to her because of her size. After a pep talk from King Julien, Melman finally reveals his feelings for Gloria.
</p><p>The next day, the animals panic when the watering hole dries up. Determined to redeem himself, Alex mends his friendship with Marty and they leave the reserve to investigate upriver. King Julien suggests that offering a sacrifice to the nearby volcano will restore the water. Melman, forlorn and believing he is dying, volunteers to be sacrificed. Gloria stops him from jumping into the volcano, and realizes that he is the perfect guy for her. Alex and Marty discover that the stranded New Yorkers have built a camp and dammed up the river, and Alex is captured by them. Zuba rushes to his aid, but Alex saves them both by dancing for the tourists, who remember him fondly from the zoo. Marty, Melman, Gloria, the penguins, and the chimpanzees arrive in the repaired airplane and help Alex destroy the dam, restoring the water. Makunga angrily makes a stand for control, but Alex tricks him into being subdued by Nana. Zuba offers Alex the title of alpha lion, but he declines, and father and son become co-leaders.

Their antics on the bridge cause the crates containing Alex, Marty, Melman, and Gloria to fall overboard and wash ashore on <a href="/wiki/Madagascar" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>, because the strap securing the crates broke off due to Alex and Marty fighting.
</p><p>The animals are soon able to regroup, initially believing themselves to be at the <a href="/wiki/San_Diego_Zoo" title="San Diego Zoo">San Diego Zoo</a>. Upon exploring, however, they come across a pack of <a href="/wiki/Lemur" title="Lemur">lemurs</a>, led by <a href="/wiki/List_of_Madagascar_(franchise)_characters#King_Julien_XIII" title="List of Madagascar (franchise) characters">King Julien XIII</a> the <a href="/wiki/Ring-tailed_lemur" title="Ring-tailed lemur">ring-tailed lemur</a>, and learn their true location. Alex blames Marty for their predicament and attempts to signal for help to get back to civilization. Marty, on the other hand, finds the wild to be exactly what he was looking for, with Gloria and Melman soon joining him in enjoying the island after getting tired of Alex's arrogance and complaining. Alex, eventually having a change of heart, comes around, but, deprived from the raw <a href="/wiki/Steak" title="Steak">steaks</a> he was provided with at the zoo, his <a href="/wiki/Prey_drive" title="Prey drive">prey drive</a> begins to show as hunger kicks in.

King Julien XIII ignores Maurice's concerns and persuades the group to help the lemurs fend off the <a href="/wiki/Fossa_(animal)" title="Fossa (animal)">fossa</a>, who hunt the lemurs as prey. While Alex initially scares the fossa away and is worshiped by the lemurs, later, compelled by hunger, he attacks Marty. Realizing that Alex is now a threat, King Julien banishes him to the far side of the island where the fossa live. Seeing what has happened to Alex, and how difficult it is to survive with so many predators around the island, Marty begins to regret his decision to leave the zoo.
</p><p>The penguins, having been to Antarctica and found it not to their liking, land the ship at Madagascar. Seeing this as a chance to return Alex to New York, Marty rushes after his friend against the wishes of Melman and Gloria. Marty attempts to convince the now grizzled, starving Alex to return, but Alex refuses out of fear of attacking Marty again. The penguins, Gloria, and Melman go to find Marty, but are trapped by the fossa. At the last minute, Alex overcomes his predatory instincts and scares the fossa away from the lemur territory forever. The lemurs regain their respect for Alex, and the penguins help him satisfy his hunger through <a href="/wiki/Sushi" title="Sushi">sushi</a>. As the lemurs throw a farewell celebration for the foursome, the penguins decide not to break the news that the ship has run out of fuel.
</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Antarctica" title="Antarctica">Antarctica</a>, three young penguin brothers — Skipper, Kowalski, and Rico — defy the laws of nature in order to save an egg the other penguins believe to be doomed. After saving it from a pack of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Leopard_seals" title="Leopard seals">leopard seals</a> and accidentally setting themselves adrift on an iceberg, the egg hatches into their new member, Private, (before the events of the <a href="/wiki/Madagascar_(2005_film)" title="Madagascar (2005 film)">first film</a>).
</p><p>Ten years later (after the events of the <a href="/wiki/Madagascar_3:_Europe%27s_Most_Wanted" title="Madagascar 3: Europe's Most Wanted">previous film</a>), the penguins decide to leave the circus to celebrate Private's birthday by breaking into the <a href="/wiki/United_States_Bullion_Depository" title="United States Bullion Depository">United States Gold Depository</a> at <a href="/wiki/Fort_Knox" title="Fort Knox">Fort Knox</a> in order to treat him to a discontinued snack called "Cheezy Dibbles" in the vending machine of their break room. Despite this, Private begins to feel out of place with the team, as he is constantly described as being the "secretary/mascot". Suddenly, they are abducted by the machine and sent to <a href="/wiki/Venice" title="Venice">Venice</a>, <a href="/wiki/Italy" title="Italy">Italy</a> by Dr. Octavius Brine, a renowned geneticist who removes his human disguise and reveals he is actually an octopus named Dave, who has grown resentful of penguins after their cuteness had him shunned from every zoo and aquarium across the globe.
</p><p>Rico swallows Dave's collection of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Snowglobes" title="Snowglobes">snowglobes</a> along with a canister of a green substance called the Medusa Serum before the four escape and are chased through the canals and streets of Venice by Dave's henchmen. When cornered, they are rescued by a group of animals from an <a href="/wiki/Arctic" title="Arctic">Arctic</a> elite undercover interspecies task force agency called "The North Wind" consisting of their leader, a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Gray_wolf" title="Gray wolf">gray wolf</a> whose name is classified (in which Skipper mistakenly calls him "Classified" throughout the film), a <a href="/wiki/Harp_seal" title="Harp seal">harp seal</a> demolitionist named Short Fuse, a <a href="/wiki/Polar_bear" title="Polar bear">polar bear</a> named Corporal, and an intelligent <a href="/wiki/Snowy_owl" title="Snowy owl">snowy owl</a> named Eva, who Kowalski instantly falls in love with. Their mission is to help animals who can't help themselves and have been fighting Dave to protect the penguin population.
</p><p>At their hideout, their communication systems are hacked by Dave, who reveals that he has an enormous supply of the Medusa Serum and that he intends to capture the penguins out of every zoo he was kicked out of. Viewing the penguins as a hindrance to their mission, Classified tranquilizes the group and sends the group to their most remote base (which happens to be on <a href="/wiki/Madagascar" title="Madagascar">Madagascar</a>) but the penguins awaken mid-flight and crash land in the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Sahara_Desert" title="Sahara Desert">Sahara Desert</a> before making their way to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Shanghai,_China" title="Shanghai, China">Shanghai, China</a>, which they mistake for <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Dublin,_Ireland" title="Dublin, Ireland">Dublin, Ireland</a>. Discovering Dave's next target in Shanghai using Dave's snowglobe collection, the penguins ship themselves to the same current location and make their way to the zoo. Skipper disguises Private as a mermaid-tailed penguin (a tourist attraction) to distract Dave from his real target, but Private is captured along with the Shanghai penguins after the North Wind arrives to put a stop to Dave's plan. The penguins take the North Wind's high-tech plane to give chase, but inadvertently self-destruct the machine. They manage to track Private to an island base, using a tracking device planted on him when Classified darted them before planting them in a flight to Madagascar. 
</p><p>Meanwhile, on the island, Dave demonstrates his way to use the medusa serum (most likely gotten from the islands plants) to genetically mutate the penguins into hideous monsters as an effort to make humans disgusted by them as revenge.
</p><p>Skipper and Classified argue on the best means to rescue the captives and stop Dave, finally settling on Classified's plan of a frontal assault and Skipper agrees to act as a diversion. The North Wind manages to corner Dave in his lair only to be captured by Dave's henchmen as well as the other penguins. Dave demonstrates his mutation ray at full power on Private, apparently disintegrating him with the beam, but unbeknownst to them he escapes at the last minute by using a paper clip he swallowed earlier. Private rescues the North Wind members, who want to <a href="/wiki/Tactical_formation" title="Tactical formation">regroup</a> due to lack of equipment, but Private, not wanting to leave anyone behind goes to stop Dave. As Dave's submarine docks at <a href="/wiki/New_York_City" title="New York City">New York</a> with the promise of returning the penguins he found to the zoo, he turns the ray on the rest of the penguins, mutating them all into hideous monsters. The city erupts into chaos as the brainwashed, mutated penguins run amok on the terrified human crowd. Getting Skipper, Kowalski and Rico back to their senses, Private decides to connect himself into the ray to return them to normal. After fending off Dave and his henchman, they manage to turn all the penguins back to normal in one huge blast.
</p><p>Private is left partially mutated from the machine while the rest of the penguins are restored to normal. Despite his strange new look, the Penguins show their gratitude and new-found respect for Private. Dave (who was caught in the blast) has been turned into a pipsqueak version of himself and is trapped in a snow globe where he is admired by a little girl. Finally seeing one another as equals, Classified promises to grant the Penguins anything they want. In addition to Kowalski getting a kiss from Eva, the Penguins are given their own jet packs and they then fly off above the clouds looking for their new adventures.
</p><p>In a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mid-credits_scene" title="Mid-credits scene">mid-credits scene</a>, the Penguins return to the circus and plug Mort into the ray and use him to revert Private back to normal. Mort does not appear to show any side effects from the ray until he manages to swallow King Julien whole.

When Barnes regains his senses, he explains that Zemo is the real Vienna bomber and wanted the location of the Siberian Hydra base, where other brainwashed "Winter Soldiers" are kept in <a href="/wiki/Suspended_animation" title="Suspended animation">cryogenic stasis</a>.
