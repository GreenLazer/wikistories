Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class.\
Aware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cal's bodyguard, Mr. Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with an iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.\
Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Lovejoy slips the necklace into Jack's pocket and he and Cal accuse him of theft.

With the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.\
After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for only one person.

Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.\
The Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk falls to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth.

Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's location. Banner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians. The Hulk finds Loki and beats him into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Midtown Manhattan}}. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed.\

Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue as Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him.\
While Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, the latter attacked Zuri and forced T'Chaka to kill him. T'Chaka ordered Zuri to lie that N'Jobu had disappeared and left behind N'Jobu's American son in order to maintain the lie.

Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity to be N'Jadaka and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat, where he kills Zuri, defeats T'Challa, and hurls him over a waterfall to his presumed death. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first. Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.\
Nakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit. W'Kabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down planes carrying the vibranium weapons. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him. Killmonger refuses to be healed, choosing to die a free man rather than be incarcerated.\

After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents, the King and Queen, take both siblings to a colony of trolls led by Grand Pabbie. He heals Anna, but alters her memories to remove traces of Elsa's magic, warning Elsa that she must learn to control her powers. The King and Queen isolate both sisters within the castle. Elsa shuts Anna out, causing a rift between them. Unable to control it, Elsa can only suppress her power, causing her to become more insecure. When the sisters are teenagers, their parents die at sea during a storm.\
When Elsa turns 21, she is to be crowned queen of Arendelle. She is terrified that the kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear her. The castle gates open to the public and visiting dignitaries for the first time in years.

When Anna's horse returns to Arendelle, Hans sets out to find Anna and Elsa, accompanied by the Duke's minions, who have secret orders to kill Elsa.\
Reaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa, but when she reveals what has become of Arendelle, Elsa becomes upset, saying that she cannot undo it, and accidentally freezes Anna's heart. She then makes a giant snow monster named Marshmallow, who chases Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf away. Anna's hair begins turning white, so Kristoff takes her to meet the trolls, his adoptive family. Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless "an act of true love" reverses the spell. Kristoff races Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss. Hans and his men reach Elsa's palace, defeating Marshmallow and capturing Elsa. Anna is delivered to Hans but, rather than kissing her, Hans instead reveals that he has actually been plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters. Hans locks Anna in a room to die, and then manipulates the dignitaries into believing that Elsa killed her. He orders the queen's execution, only to discover she has escaped her detention cell.\
Olaf frees Anna, and they venture into the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Blizzard"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 blizzard}}\'a0outside to meet Kristoff, whom Olaf reveals is in love with her.

Realizing that love is the key to controlling her magic, Elsa ends the winter and gives Olaf his own snow flurry to survive the warmer climate. Both Hans and the Duke are arrested and exiled from the kingdom. Anna gives Kristoff a new sleigh, and the two kiss. Both sisters are reunited and Elsa promises never to lock the castle gates again.\
A beautiful enchantress disguised as an old beggar woman arrives at a French castle during a ball and offers the host, a cruel and selfish prince, a rose in return for shelter from a storm. When he refuses, she reveals her identity. To punish the prince for his lack of compassion, the enchantress transforms him into a beast and his servants into household objects, then erases the castle, the prince and his servants from the memories of their loved ones (in the small town of Villeneuve nearby). She casts a spell on the rose and warns the prince that if he learns to love another, and earn their love in return before the last petal falls, then the spell will be broken. If not, he will remain a beast forever.\
Some years later, at Villeneuve, Belle, the book-loving daughter of a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Music_box"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 music box}}\'a0maker and artist, Maurice, dreams of adventure and brushes off advances from Gaston, an arrogant former soldier. On his way to a convention and lost in the forest, Maurice seeks refuge in the Beast's castle warming himself near the fire then being scared away by Chip after having some food, but the Beast imprisons him for stealing a rose from his garden as a gift to Belle. When Maurice's horse returns without him, Belle ventures out in search for him, and finds him locked in the castle dungeon. The Beast agrees to let her take Maurice's place.\
Belle befriends the castle's servants, who invite her to a spectacular dinner. When she wanders into the forbidden west wing and finds the rose, the Beast scares her into the woods. She is ambushed by a pack of wolves, but the Beast rescues her, and is injured in the process. As Belle nurses his wounds, a friendship develops between them, also he shows her his library and gives it to her which makes her feel a different way towards the Beast unlike before. The Beast shows Belle a gift from the enchantress, a book that transports readers wherever they want. Belle uses the book to visit her childhood home in Paris, where she discovers a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Plague_doctor_costume"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 plague doctor mask}}\'a0and realizes that she and her father were forced to leave when her mother succumbed to the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Bubonic_plague"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 plague}}.\
In Villeneuve, Maurice tries to convince the other villagers of the Beast and Belle's imprisonment but no one believes him. Gaston, seeing rescuing Belle as an opportunity to win her hand in marriage, agrees to help Maurice. When Maurice learns of his ulterior motive and rejects him, Gaston abandons him to be eaten by the wolves. Maurice is rescued by the hermit Agathe, but when he tells the townsfolk of Gaston's crime and is unable to provide solid evidence, Gaston convinces them to send Maurice to an insane asylum.\
After sharing a romantic dance with the Beast, Belle discovers her father's predicament using a magic mirror. The Beast places Belle's happiness before his own releases her to save Maurice, giving her the mirror to remember him with leaving him and his servants heartbroken. At Villeneuve, Belle reveals the Beast in the mirror to the townsfolk, proving her father's sanity. Realizing that Belle loves the Beast, a jealous Gaston claims she has been charmed by dark magic, and has her thrown into the asylum carriage with her father. He rallies the villagers to follow him to the castle to slay the Beast before he curses the whole village. Maurice and Belle escape, and Belle rushes back to the castle.\
During the battle, Gaston abandons his companion LeFou, who then sides with the servants to fend off the villagers. Gaston attacks the Beast in his tower, who is too heartbroken from Belle's departure to fight back, but regains his spirit upon seeing Belle return. He defeats Gaston, but spares his life before reuniting with Belle. Ungrateful and unrepentant, Gaston mortally wounds the Beast with a gunshot from a bridge, but it collapses when the castle crumbles, and he falls to his death. The injured Beast tells Belle that he was happy to see her again then he dies in her arms as the last petal falls, and the servants become inanimate. Belle tearfully professes her love to the Beast, Agathe reveals herself as the enchantress and undoes the curse, repairing the crumbling castle, and reviving the Beast then turning him and his servants' human making the villagers' remember their loved ones. The Prince and Belle host a ball for the villagers, where they dance happily.\

Lucius tries to protect them, but is overwhelmed and placed under Evelyn's control.\
Violet, Dash, and Jack-Jack escape with the help of the Incredibile, a high-tech car once owned by Bob during his time as Mr. Incredible, and reach Winston's ship. On board, the hypnotized Mr. Incredible, Elastigirl, and Frozone recite a vindictive manifesto on air to paint superheroes as a threat. They subdue the ship crew, aim the ship at Municiberg, and destroy the controls. The Incredible children reach them, upon which Jack-Jack removes Elastigirl's goggles, and she frees Mr. Incredible and Frozone.

Prior to the theft, Dom briefly evades Cipher\'97with the help of Raldo\'97and persuades Deckard and Owen's mother, Magdalene Shaw, to help him. Cipher hacks into the electronics systems of a large number of cars, causing them to drive automatically and taking out the convoy so that Dom can take the football. The team intercepts Dom, but Dom escapes, shooting and apparently killing Deckard in the process. Letty catches up to Dom, but is ambushed and nearly killed by Cipher's enforcer, Connor Rhodes, before Dom rescues her. In retaliation, Cipher has Rhodes execute Elena in front of Dom.\

They are once again intercepted by the team, who attempt to shut down the sub, and then drive out toward the gates that would prevent the sub from leaving into open waters. Meanwhile, Deckard, whose death was apparently faked, teams up with Owen, and at Magdalene's behest, infiltrates Cipher's plane to rescue Dom's son. Once Deckard reports that the child is safe, Dom turns on Cipher and kills Rhodes, avenging Elena's death, before rejoining his team.

Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin behind Slattery's cover. After capturing Stark, Killian reveals that he has subjected Potts to Extremis in the hope that Stark will help fix Extremis's flaws while trying to save her.

Stark saves some surviving passengers and crew but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. They trace Killian to an impounded damaged oil tanker where Killian intends to kill Ellis on live television. The Vice President will become a puppet leader, following Killian's orders in exchange for Extremis to cure his young daughter's disability. On the platform, Stark works to save Potts, as Rhodes goes after the President. Stark summons his remaining Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Rhodes secures the President and takes him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived the Extremis procedure; before he can save her, a rig collapses around them and she falls to her apparent death. Stark confronts Killian and traps him in an Iron Man suit that he self-destructs, but fails to kill him. Potts, whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive her fall, intervenes and kills Killian.\
Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy each Iron Man suit as a sign of his devotion to Potts, while the Vice President and Slattery are arrested. With Stark's help, Potts' Extremis effects are stabilized, and Stark promises to scale back his life as Iron Man, undergoing surgery to remove the shrapnel near his heart and throwing his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea. He muses that, even without the technology, he will always be Iron Man.\

While on the run from Cemetery Wind and Lockdown, Lucas is killed by one of Lockdown's grenades. Escaping into the desert, they take refuge in an abandoned gas station.

Using a CIA drone which he stole during the home invasion, Cade discovers K.S.I.'s involvement in the attacks on the Autobots. Optimus vows to personally kill Attinger for his actions against his brethren.\

Joshua Joyce, the ambitious company CEO, is in league with Attinger to revolutionize global defenses and improve human society using the Seed.

In a fit of rage, the Autobots storm the building, during which Bumblebee regains his original form by scanning a passing car, where they rescue Brains and destroy the laboratory, but they soon leave after Joshua announces that they are no longer needed. Attinger forces Joshua to deploy Galvatron and Stinger to attack the Autobots. During the battle, Galvatron's behavior becomes slightly erratic when it starts destroying vehicles, and when it fights Optimus it speaks to him. Lockdown then arrives and abducts Optimus while Galvatron and Stinger retreat; Tessa is inadvertently captured alongside Optimus in the midst of the chaos, leaving Cade and Shane devastated.\
While Lockdown's large prison spacecraft hovers over Chicago to hand over the Seed, Cade, Shane, and the Autobots use the opportunity to sneak on board and rescue Optimus and Tessa, hijacking a smaller ship containing a group of Autobots called the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Dinobots"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Dinobots}}, just before Lockdown leaves Earth. The Autobots reveal to Cade that "Galvatron" is in fact Megatron, who gave K.S.I. the data to build the Transformer drones so he could transfer his consciousness into the Galvatron drone, after they had unknowingly revived him. What's more, Galvatron is plotting to use the Seed and the K.S.I. drones to conquer the world by detonating the Seed in\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Hong_Kong"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Hong Kong}}, as K.S.I. has brought it there to use it in the remote Mongolian desert to create vast amounts of usable Transformium. Cade informs Joshua of Megatron's presence, causing him to have a change of heart and agreeing to hand over the Seed with help from Darcy and his Chinese business associate Su Yueming. Meanwhile, Lockdown discovers Optimus' escape with the Dinobots, and returns to Earth to retrieve them. Optimus decides for the Autobots to no longer help the humans because of how they revived Megatron, but Cade explains to Optimus why he shouldn't lose faith in them. At the K.S.I. facility, during a disagreement between Joshua and Attinger over the Seed, Galvatron reactivates himself and promptly takes control of the K.S.I. drones, and a battle follows in Hong Kong's streets between Cade's group, the Autobots, Cemetery Wind, Galvatron, and his drones. During the fight, Optimus gains the alliance of the Dinobots, who become essential to the Autobots' victory while Bumblebee kills Stinger.\
Lockdown returns to capture Optimus and the Dinobots, using a large\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Magnet"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 magnet}}\'a0in his ship that picks up and drops metal objects, causing destruction to the city. After disabling the magnet, Optimus fights Lockdown at an abandoned factory. In the ensuing duel, Optimus kills Attinger (who still angrily deems all Cybertronians aside from Lockdown as a threat) to save Cade, and avenging the deaths of his fellow Autobots, but this allows Lockdown to pin Optimus down by impaling his chest with his own sword. Cade, Bumblebee, Tessa, and Shane fight Lockdown, with Cade ending up fighting him one-on-one while Tessa and Shane use a tow truck to free Optimus, who kills Lockdown by cutting him in half before using one of his grenades to finish off the remaining drones. Galvatron retreats, vowing to return.\
As Lockdown's ship leaves Earth, Optimus tells the Autobots to protect the Yeagers (with Joshua offering to help the Yeagers build a new home) and lets the Dinobots go, before flying away into space with the Seed to hide it away, sending a message to the Creators that\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Transformers:_The_Last_Knight"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 he is coming for them}}.\

After managing to lure in a mermaid named Tamara, she summons other mermaids to attack the crew before Jack causes an explosion that scares them away. A mermaid named Syrena is caught, but Philip Swift, a captive missionary, falls in love with her. Reaching Ponce de Le\'f3n's ship on an uncharted island, Angelica and Blackbeard coerce Jack into retrieving both chalices. Jack locates the grounded, decaying vessel, only to find Barbossa there. Both guess that the Spanish have taken the chalices, after they are nowhere to be found on the vessel.\
Jack and Barbossa team up to sneak into the Spanish camp and steal the chalices. Barbossa reveals he only wants revenge against Blackbeard for attacking the\'a0
\f1\i Black Pearl
\f0\i0 , and his leg being amputated. Jack and Barbossa escape with the chalices. Meanwhile, Syrena, reciprocating Philip's love, is tricked into shedding a tear. Blackbeard collects it, leaving her to die of dehydration while Philip is forced to go with them. Jack returns with the chalices and bargains with Blackbeard for Angelica's safety, Jack's confiscated magical compass (which they took from him before sending him to get the chalices), and Gibbs' release. In return, Jack vows to give Blackbeard the chalices and lead him to the Fountain; Blackbeard agrees, and Gibbs is set free with the compass.\
At the Fountain, Blackbeard's crew is confronted by Barbossa and his men and they battle while Barbossa and Blackbeard fight. The Spanish suddenly arrive, intending to destroy the Fountain, believing its power an abomination against God. They crush the chalices and throw them in the swamp. When Barbossa stabs Blackbeard with a poisoned sword, Angelica pulls it out but is cut and poisoned. Jack notices Angelica is poisoned and begins frantically searching the swamp for the chalices. Barbossa obtains Blackbeard's magic sword and gains control of the\'a0
\f1\i Queen Anne's Revenge
\f0\i0 \'a0and her crew. Despite resistance from Blackbeard's crew, the Spanish successfully pull down a pillar, crushing the Fountain of Youth. The Spanish army leaves once the fountain is in ruins. Philip is mortally wounded, but he returns to free Syrena. She helps Jack retrieve the missing chalices and gives them to him, telling him not to waste her tear. Syrena goes back to the dying Philip. She says she can save him if he asks her to. When he asks for her forgiveness, she kisses him and takes him underwater.\
With Blackbeard and Angelica both nearing death, Jack retrieves the last remaining drops of water from the destroyed fountain and puts the tear in one of them. Knowing that one of them must be sacrificed, he wants Angelica to drink from the chalice containing the tear. Instead, Blackbeard drinks it, asking his daughter to save him. Angelica agrees and drinks from the second chalice. Jack is upset to lose Angelica, but reveals that he made a mistake about which chalice contained the tear. Neither of the two are happy, and they both believe Jack deliberately tricked them. Angelica's wounds are healed as the Fountain fatally consumes Blackbeard's body, killing him.\
Eventually, Jack and Angelica admit their love for each other, yet he distrusts her intentions (aware that she may try to avenge her father) and strands her on a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Cay"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 cay}}.

Meanwhile, Lucy struggles to adapt to her new role as the children's new mom. The next morning, when a butler named Fritz arrives at the Gru house, Gru discovers that he has a twin brother named Dru, who lives in a distant country named Freedonia, who longs to meet him. Shocked to learn he has a twin, Gru confronts his mother, who reveals that when she and her husband\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Divorce"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 divorced}}, they agreed to keep one child each. The family decides to travel to meet Dru, and they are surprised at his immense wealth, the size of the mansion, which Fritz attributes to their pig farm business. Meanwhile, the Minions are arrested for trespassing at a talent show set. Bratt manages to steal the diamond again, intending to use it to power a giant robot and destroy Hollywood as revenge for the cancellation of his show.\
Dru reveals to Gru that their recently deceased father was a legendary supervillain, whose villainous activities are the real source of the family's wealth. As Dru was dismissed by their father as a disgrace, he asks his brother to teach him how to be a villain. When Gru refuses to revert to his old ways, Dru takes him on a joyride around Freedonia in their father's technologically advanced car and the siblings bond. Meanwhile, Lucy tries to balance her new tasks as a mom, which she exhibits after turning away a young boy named Niko who had fallen for Margo in the midst of a traditional cheese festival, while Edith and Agnes stumble into a local tavern and learn from the bartender about a mythical\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Unicorn"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 unicorn}}\'a0which lurks in a nearby forest.

Meanwhile, the Minions' longing for Gru motivates them to escape from prison and return to their former master.\
Dru convinces Gru to steal the diamond, with Gru secretly intending to bring it to the AVL, which he hopes will convince Da Vinci to rehire him and Lucy. Despite several setbacks, they manage to retrieve the diamond and are rescued by Lucy after narrowly escaping. After finding out Gru's true motives, Dru confronts his brother about his lie. In return, Gru insults him and decides to leave Freedonia, ending their relationship. Bratt, disguised as Lucy, kidnaps the children, and once again acquires the diamond. Gru and Dru resolve their differences and pursue him after finding the real Lucy.\
With his robot powered by the diamond, Bratt terrorizes Hollywood, intending to send it into space with the use of superpowered gum. Lucy saves the children while Gru and Dru weaken Bratt's robot with the weapons of their father's car. Gru is knocked unconscious when the car is destroyed, and Dru manages to destroy the robot's core from the inside when Bratt threatens to kill Gru. When Gru recovers, he battles Bratt in a dance fight, using it as a distraction to grab his weaponized\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Keytar"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 keytar}}, and defeats him. Having rendezvoused with Gru, the Minions manage to destroy the gum already covering the city, and Gru and Dru reunite.\
Soon afterward, Gru and Lucy are reinstated in the AVL and the newly united family celebrate in Gru's home. Lucy is acknowledged by the children as their mother. Lured back to villainy, Dru, along with most of the Minions, steals Gru's airship, with Gru's emblem replaced with a "D" graffiti. Gru and Lucy decide to give them a five-minute head-start before engaging pursuit.\

At his home, Manchas mentions Otterton yelled about "night howlers" before the attack. Moments later, Manchas himself turns savage and chases the pair. Judy saves Nick by trapping Manchas and calls the ZPD for help, but when they arrive, Manchas has vanished. Bogo demands that Judy turn in her badge, but Nick reminds Bogo that Judy still has ten hours to solve the case.\
At City Hall, Bellwether allows Judy and Nick access to the city's traffic cameras. They discover Manchas was captured by wolves, who Judy surmises are the "night howlers". They locate the missing predators\'97all gone savage\'97imprisoned at Cliffside Asylum, where Mayor Leodore Lionheart hides them from the public while trying to determine the cause of their behavior. Lionheart and the asylum staff are arrested for false imprisonment and Bellwether becomes the new mayor.\
Judy, praised for solving the case, has become friends with Nick and asks him to join the ZPD as her partner. However, she upsets him at a press conference by suggesting a predatory biological cause for the recent savage behavior; her comments also incite hateful speech and discrimination against predators throughout Zootopia. Wracked with guilt for the consequences of her words, Judy quits her job and returns to Bunnyburrow.\
Back home, Judy learns that the night howlers are actually the crocus bulbs Weaselton stole, and they contain a neurotoxin that has severe\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Psychoactive_drug"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 psychotropic effects}}\'a0on mammals, causing them to go savage.

Judy and Nick obtain the serum as evidence, but before they can reach the ZPD, Bellwether confronts them in the Natural History Museum and takes the evidence, revealing herself as the mastermind behind a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Supremacism"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 prey-supremacist}}\'a0conspiracy to frame predators as dangerous and savage. Bellwether traps Judy and Nick in an exhibition after Nick refuses to abandon an injured Judy. She shoots a serum pellet at Nick to make him attack Judy and summons the ZPD for help, but Judy and Nick have replaced the serum pellets in Bellwether's gun with blueberries. Enraged, Bellwether threatens to frame the pair for the attacks before discovering that Judy baited her into openly declaring her role in the attacks and recorded the confession with her recording device; Bellwether attempts to escape, only to find herself and her crooked group of cops surrounded by Chief Bogo and his loyal officers.\
Bellwether is arrested and sent to prison for her actions. Lionheart publicly denies knowledge of Bellwether's plot and states that his imprisonment of the savage predators was a "wrong thing for the right reason". With the cause of the epidemic identified, the savage animals are cured and Judy rejoins the ZPD. Nick graduates from the Zootopia Police Academy as the city's first fox police officer and becomes Judy's partner.\

Batman finds Lau in Hong Kong and brings him back to Gotham to testify, allowing Dent to apprehend the entire mob. The Joker threatens to keep killing people unless Batman reveals his identity, and starts by murdering Police Commissioner\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Gillian_B._Loeb"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Gillian B.

Dent kidnaps one of Joker\'92s henchmen and threatens him with a seemingly deadly game of heads-or-tails using Dent's lucky coin, which is revealed to be heads on both sides. Dent learns that Rachel is Joker's next target.\
Bruce decides to reveal his secret identity to prevent more deaths. Before he can, however, Dent falsely announces that\'a0

Batman comes to Dent's rescue and Gordon, who faked his death, apprehends the Joker, securing a promotion to Commissioner. Rachel and Dent are escorted away by detectives on Maroni's payroll; Gordon later learns that they never arrived home. Batman interrogates the Joker, who reveals that they have been trapped in separate locations rigged with explosives and that Batman must choose one to save. Batman races to save Rachel, while Gordon attempts to rescue Dent. Batman arrives at the building, but realizes that the Joker sent him to Dent's location instead. Both buildings explode, killing Rachel and disfiguring half of Dent's face. The Joker escapes with Lau, who leads him to the Mob's funds.

Not wanting Reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the Joker threatens to destroy a hospital unless Reese is killed within an hour. All hospitals are evacuated and Gordon travels to secure Reese. The Joker, disguised as a hospital nurse, discovers Dent's ward and hands him a gun, convincing him to seek revenge for Rachel's death. The Joker then destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. Dent goes on a killing spree, deciding the fates of people he holds responsible for Rachel's death by flipping his lucky coin, which was disfigured on one face by the explosion. Dent eventually apprehends Gordon's family, believing Gordon's love for his family parallels his love for Rachel.\
After announcing that Gotham City will be subject to his rule by nightfall, the Joker rigs two evacuating ferries with explosives; one containing civilians and the other containing prisoners. The passengers have been supplied with a trigger to the other boat's explosives, and the Joker announces through an intercom that he will blow both ferries if one of them has not been destroyed by midnight. Batman finds the Joker by using a sonar device that spies on the entire city, with the reluctant help of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Lucius_Fox"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Lucius Fox}}. Both the civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while Batman apprehends the Joker after a brief fight. Before the police arrive to take the Joker into custody, he gloats that Gotham's citizens will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes public knowledge.\
Gordon and Batman arrive at the building where Rachel perished and find Dent threatening to kill Gordon's family. Dent again flips his coin and shoots Batman, spares himself, and aims to kill Gordon's son while claiming that Gordon's negligence is responsible for Rachel's death. Before he can flip his coin for the boy, Batman, who was wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the building to his death.

Quirrell removes his turban and reveals a weak Voldemort living on the back of his head. Through an enchantment placed by Dumbledore, Harry finds the stone in his possession. Voldemort attempts to bargain the stone from Harry in exchange for reviving his parents, but Harry refuses, causing Quirrell to attack. Harry kills Quirrell by burning his skin and reducing him to dust, after which Voldemort's spirit rises from Quirrell's ashes and knocks Harry unconscious.\
Harry recovers in the school hospital with Dumbledore at his side. Dumbledore explains that the stone has been destroyed and that Ron and Hermione are safe. Dumbledore also reveals how Harry was able to defeat Quirrell: when Harry's mother died to save him, her death gave Harry a love-based protection against Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances, tying them for first place with Slytherin. Dumbledore then awards ten points to Neville for attempting to stop the trio, granting Gryffindor the House Cup. Harry returns home for the summer, happy to finally have a real home in Hogwarts.\
A mysterious vehicle using a giant magnet steals a highly potent mutagen known as PX-41 from a secret laboratory in the Arctic Circle. The Anti-Villain League (AVL), led by Silas Ramsbottom, tries to recruit former super-villain Gru to track down the culprit and recover the mutagen. However, Gru refuses, claiming that he is now a legitimate businessman and the devoted father to Margo, Edith, and Agnes. Longing to resume his criminal life, Dr. Nefario, Gru's friend and assistant, leaves Gru for new employment. Gru reluctantly agrees to investigate the theft and works with undercover AVL agent Lucy Wilde.\
The pair begin their search in the Paradise Shopping Mall, disguised as bakery employees. Gru immediately suspects the Mexican restaurant owner, Eduardo P\'e9rez, of being the infamous "El Macho", a legendary super-villain who supposedly died by riding a shark into the mouth of an active volcano with 250 pounds of dynamite strapped to his chest. Gru and Lucy break into Eduardo's restaurant at night but find no proof. Meanwhile, Agnes, who dreams of having a mother one day, believes that Gru will fall in love with Lucy. Gru denies it, saying his relationship with Lucy is only professional.\
Although holding Eduardo as his prime suspect, Gru agrees to pursue others, including wig merchant Floyd Eagle-san. After witnessing Eduardo's two-timing son, Antonio, woo Margo and invite everyone to his Cinco de Mayo party, Gru renews his focus on Eduardo. His neighbor, Jillian, sets him up on a dinner date with her vacuous friend Shannon. The date goes awry, but Lucy arrives and rescues Gru from being humiliated by shooting Shannon with a tranquilizer gun. While they take Shannon home, Gru and Lucy spend personal time together, and Gru falls in love with her.\
The next day, the AVL arrest Eagle-san after finding an almost-empty jar of the mutagen in his shop, and the investigation is closed by Ramsbottom. Lucy is reassigned to Australia and gives Gru her lipstick taser as a gift before leaving. A heartbroken Gru, having lacked the courage to ask Lucy out on a date, instead takes the girls to the Cinco de Mayo party. There, he follows Eduardo and discovers a secret musical steps-activated elevator, where he finally finds proof that Eduardo is El Macho.\
On her flight, Lucy, realizing that she has also fallen in love with Gru, jumps out of the plane and uses a hang-glider to reach the party. Gru discovers that El Macho, who has hired Nefario as a partner, has been abducting Gru's Minions and using the stolen PX-41 serum to make them rabid and indestructible. El Macho plans to launch rockets full of the mutated Minions into major cities in order to dominate the world. He offers Gru the chance to team up with him, but Gru walks away.\
Lucy later arrives at the party, but El Macho captures Lucy after Pollito, El Macho's pet chicken, retrieves her AVL ID badge from her purse. Nefario rejoins Gru, who fakes being captured with two other minions to help him enter El Macho's fortress. Nefario creates an antidote to the serum. Gru, Nefario, and the girls use it as a weapon to return the Minions to their normal state. El Macho then applies the mutagen on himself and turns into a monster, but Gru and Nefario defeat him using Lucy's lipstick taser and a fart gun.\
Gru finds Lucy strapped to a TNT-loaded shark rocket and starts to untie her, but Pollito launches the rocket, sending it flying towards the same volcano where El Macho previously faked his death. Lucy accepts Gru's invitation for a date, and the pair dive into the ocean seconds before the rocket enters the volcano and violently explodes. Gru rejoins the AVL, and he and Lucy eventually get married, giving Margo, Edith and Agnes a mother.\

Now a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reunite and fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a drought-stricken wasteland under Scar's reign. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as king. Realizing that he can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.\
Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who had just struck Sarabi. Scar taunts Simba over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to him that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame the hyenas for his actions; Simba spares his life, but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to toss him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. Afterwards, Simba takes over the kingship as rain begins to fall.\
Later, with Pride Rock restored to its usual state, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of life.\

Resentful against man for scarring him, he issues a warning that he will kill Mowgli at the end of the drought. After the drought ends, the wolves debate whether they should keep Mowgli or not. Mowgli decides to leave the jungle for the safety of his pack. Bagheera agrees with the decision and volunteers to guide him to the nearby man village.\
En route, Shere Khan ambushes them and injures Bagheera, but Mowgli manages to escape. Later, Mowgli meets an enormous python named\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Kaa"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Kaa}}, who hypnotizes him. While under her influence, Mowgli sees a vision of his father being killed by Shere Khan while protecting him, which also warns of the destructive power of the "red flower" (fire).

The two bond while retrieving some difficult-to-access honey, and Mowgli agrees to stay with Baloo until the winter season arrives. Meanwhile, upon learning that Mowgli has left the jungle, Shere Khan throws Akela off to his death and threatens the pack to lure Mowgli out.\
Bagheera eventually finds Mowgli and Baloo and is shocked that Mowgli has not joined the humans as he had agreed, but Baloo calms him down and persuades both of them to sleep on it. During the night, Mowgli finds a herd of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Indian_elephant"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Indian elephants}}\'a0led by\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Hathi"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Hathi}}\'a0gathered around a ditch and uses vines to save a baby elephant from the ditch. Although Baloo and Bagheera are impressed, Baloo realizes that he cannot guarantee Mowgli's safety after learning that he is being hunted by Shere Khan. Baloo agrees to push Mowgli away to get him to continue onward to the man village.\
Mowgli is kidnapped by a gang of monkeys known as the "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Bandar-log"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Bandar-log}}", who present him to their leader, a giant ape named\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/King_Louie"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 King Louie}}. Assuming that all humans can make fire, King Louie offers Mowgli protection from Shere Khan in exchange for it. Baloo distracts King Louie while Bagheera tries to sneak him out, but their plan is discovered. As King Louie chases Mowgli through his temple, he informs Mowgli of Akela's death. King Louie's rampage eventually causes his temple to collapse on top of him.\
Furious that Baloo and Bagheera never told him about Akela's death, Mowgli goes to confront Shere Khan alone. He steals a lit torch at the village to use as a weapon and heads back to the jungle, accidentally starting a wildfire in the process. He confronts Shere Khan, who argues that Mowgli has made himself the enemy of the jungle by causing the wildfire. Mowgli throws the torch into the water, giving Shere Khan the advantage. Baloo, Bagheera, and the wolf pack intervene and hold Shere Khan off, giving Mowgli enough time to set a trap. He lures Shere Khan up a dead tree and onto a branch, which breaks under the tiger's weight, and Shere Khan falls into the fire to his death. Mowgli then directs the elephants to divert the river and put out the fire. In the aftermath, Raksha becomes the new leader of the wolf pack. Mowgli decides to utilize his equipment and tricks for his own use, having found his true home and calling with his wolf family, Baloo and Bagheera.\

Nigel warns them that Van Pelt will stop at nothing to retrieve the jewel, which gives him control of Jumanji's animals; Van Pelt himself is possessed by its power. They begin tackling the game's increasingly-difficult "levels", losing lives as they do so. The four are rescued by Alex, the missing fifth player, whose avatar is pilot Jefferson "Seaplane" McDonough. Taking shelter in a jungle house built by the game's previous player Alan Parrish, Alex believes that he has been in the game for a few months and is distressed to learn that it is really twenty years. The newcomers vow to help him return home.

At the statue, the players are surrounded by a pack of jaguars and Van Pelt's forces. They outmaneuver their opposition while Spencer and Martha race to the statue. Van Pelt confronts Martha and demands the jewel, but she purposely gets a snake to bite her, allowing her to respawn and to get the jewel to Spencer. With the players on their last lives, they end the game, with Van Pelt disintegrating into a bunch of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Rat"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 rats}}, and return to the school basement, though without Alex. They find the formerly-dilapidated Vreeke home restored and decorated for a Christmas family gathering. An adult Alex arrives, having returned to 1996 when the game ended. Now married with children, he reveals he named his eldest daughter after Bethany out of gratitude for saving his life.\
Spencer and Fridge reconcile, Bethany begins caring for others more than herself and plans a summer wilderness backpacking adventure, Martha and Spencer become romantically involved and the four are now friends after their experiences in the game. When they hear Jumanji's drumbeats, they bring the game behind the school and Fridge destroys it with a bowling ball to prevent anyone from playing it.\

Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Biological_neural_network"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 biological neural network}}\'a0native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate before commencing the attack. While trying to warn the Na'vi, Jake confesses to being a spy, and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Seeing this, Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chac\'f3n, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, frees Jake and Grace and airlifts them to Grace's outpost, but during the escape Quaritch fires at them, hitting Grace.\
To regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'vi.

Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class.\
Aware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cal's bodyguard, Mr. Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with an iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.\
Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Lovejoy slips the necklace into Jack's pocket and he and Cal accuse him of theft.

With the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.\
After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for only one person.

Her love of music and the mountains, her youthful enthusiasm and imagination, and her lack of discipline cause some concern among the nuns. The Mother Abbess, believing Maria would be happier outside the abbey, sends her to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children\'97Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. Liesl, the oldest, is won over after Maria protects her from discovery when she is nearly caught sneaking back into the house after meeting with Rolfe, a messenger boy she is in love with.\
While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children and takes them around Salzburg and the surrounding mountains, and teaches them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend, Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake that concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities, and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain orders her to return to the abbey. Just then he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. Afterwards, he apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay.\

Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy while convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. Back at the abbey, when Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her life. After Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess.

Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slip away and seek shelter at the nearby abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Brownshirts soon arrive and search the abbey, and the family is discovered by Rolfe. Upon seeing Liesl, he hesitates raising the alarm long enough to allow the family time to flee, and the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When the soldiers attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start as two nuns have removed parts of the engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom.\

Elliott returns home to his distressed family. Michael searches for and finds E.T. dying next to a culvert. Michael takes E.T. home to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son's illness and the dying alien, just as government agents invade the house. Scientists set up a hospital at the house, questioning Michael, Mary and Gertie while treating Elliott and E.T. Their connection disappears and E.T. then appears to die while Elliott recovers. A grief-stricken Elliott is left alone with the motionless E.T. when he notices a dead chrysanthemum, the plant E.T. had previously revived, coming back to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael's friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bicycles.

Standing near the spaceship, E.T.'s heart glows as he prepares to return home. Mary, Gertie, and "Keys", a friendly government agent, show up. E.T. says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, as she presents him with the chrysanthemum that he had revived. Before boarding the spaceship, he embraces Elliott and tells him "I'll be right here", pointing his glowing finger to Elliott's forehead. He then picks up the chrysanthemum, boards the spaceship, and it takes off, leaving a rainbow in the sky as everyone watches it leave.\

Moses warns him the next plague to fall upon Egypt will be summoned by Pharaoh himself.

One night, the idealistic reformer Pavel Pavlovich ("Pasha") Antipov ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Tom_Courtenay"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Tom Courtenay}}) drifts into left-wing extremism after being wounded by sabre-wielding\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Dragoons"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 dragoons}}\'a0during a peaceful demonstration. Pasha runs to Lara, whom he wants to marry, to treat his wound. He asks her to hide a gun he picked up at the demonstration.\
Lara's mother discovers her affair with Komarovsky and attempts suicide. Komarovsky summons help from his physician ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Geoffrey_Keen"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Geoffrey Keen}}), Zhivago's former professor, whom he accompanies back to Lara's home to treat her mother. When Komarovsky learns of Lara's intentions to marry Pasha, he tries to dissuade Lara, and then rapes her. In revenge, the humiliated Lara takes the pistol she has been hiding for Pasha and shoots Komarovsky at a Christmas Eve party, wounding him. Komarovsky insists no action be taken against Lara, who is escorted out by Pasha. Zhivago tends Komarovsky's wound. Although enraged and devastated by Lara's affair with Komarovsky, Pasha marries Lara, and they have a daughter named Katya.\

Together they run a field hospital for six months, during which time radical changes ensue throughout Russia as\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Vladimir Lenin}}arrives in Moscow. Before their departure, Yuri and Lara fall in love, but Yuri remains true to Tonya, who became his wife.\
After the war, Yuri returns to his wife Tonya, son Sasha, and Alexander (Anna has since died), whose house in Moscow has been divided into\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Tenements"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 tenements}}\'a0by the new Soviet government.

Yevgraf arranges for passes and documents in order for Yuri and his family to escape from the new political capital of Moscow to the far-away Gromeko estate at Varykino, in the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Ural_Mountains"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Ural Mountains}}. Zhivago, Tonya, Sasha, and Alexander board a heavily guarded cattle train, at which time they are informed that they will be travelling through contested territory, which is being secured by the infamous Bolshevik commander named Strelnikov, who is, in fact, Pasha Antipov.\
While the train is stopped early one morning, Zhivago wanders away. He stumbles across the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Armoured_train"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 armoured train}}\'a0of Strelnikov sitting on a hidden siding. Yuri is summoned before Strelnikov, whom he recognizes as the former Pasha Antipov. During a tense interview, Strelnikov informs Yuri that his estranged wife Lara is now living in the town of Yuriatin, then occupied by the anti-Communist\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/White_Army"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 White Army}}\'a0forces. He permits Zhivago to return to his family, although it is hinted by Strelnikov's right-hand man that most people interrogated by Strelnikov end up being shot.\
The family lives a peaceful life in a cottage at the Varykino estate until Zhivago finds Lara in nearby Yuriatin, at which point they surrender to their long-repressed feelings. When Tonya becomes pregnant, Yuri breaks off with Lara, only to be abducted and conscripted into service by Communist\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Partisans_(military)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 partisans}}.\
After two years, Zhivago at last deserts and trudges through the deep snow to Yuriatin where he finds Lara. Lara tells Yuri that Tonya had discovered her while searching for him, and that his family is now in Moscow. She reveals a sealed letter Tonya had mailed to Lara 6 months ago to give to Yuri: Tonya, her father, and their children are being deported and will live in\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Paris"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Paris}}. Yuri and Lara renew their relationship.\
One night, Komarovsky arrives and informs them they are being watched by the Cheka due to Lara's connection by marriage to Strelnikov and Yuri's "counter-revolutionary" poetry and desertion. Komarovsky offers Yuri and Lara his help in leaving Russia. They refuse. Instead, they return to the abandoned Varykino estate, taking up residence in the banned main house, where Yuri begins writing the "Lara" poems. These will later make him famous but also incur government displeasure. Komarovsky reappears and tells Yuri that Strelnikov was captured only five miles away while apparently returning to Lara, but then committed suicide en route to his own execution. Therefore, Lara is in immediate danger of execution herself, as the Cheka had only left her free to lure Strelnikov out of hiding. Zhivago sends Lara and Katya away with Komarovsky, who has been appointed a government official in the nominally independent\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Far_Eastern_Republic"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Far Eastern Republic}}\'a0of the early 1920s. Refusing to accompany a man he despises, Yuri remains behind to face his fate.\
Years later, Yevgraf finds a sick and destitute Yuri in Moscow during the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Stalinist_era"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Stalinist era}}\'a0and gives him a new suit and a job. While riding a tram, Yuri spots a woman he surely thinks is Lara walking on a nearby street. Unable to call her from the tram, Yuri struggles to get off at the next stop. Yuri runs after her but suffers a fatal heart attack before he can even signal to her, and the woman walks away oblivious to Yuri's presence. Yuri's funeral is well attended, a surprise to Yevgraf as Yuri's poetry was officially "unobtainable at the time". Lara approaches Yevgraf at the funeral and reveals she had given birth to Yuri's daughter, but lost her in the collapse of the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Occupation_of_Mongolia"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 White-controlled government in Mongolia}}. After vainly looking over hundreds of orphans with Yevgraf's help, Lara disappears during\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Joseph_Stalin"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Joseph Stalin}}'s\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Great_Purge"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Great Purge}}\'a0of the late 1930s, and "died or vanished somewhere ... in one of the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Gulag"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 labour camps}}", according to Yevgraf.\
While Yevgraf strongly feels that Tanya Komarova is Yuri and Lara's daughter, he is still not convinced. But as Tanya leaves, Yevgraf notices that she carries a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Balalaika"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 balalaika}}, an instrument that Yuri's mother was especially gifted at playing. Questioning her further, he learns that Tanya is self-taught \'97 in fact, her fianc\'e9 proclaims her an 'artist' with the balalaika. Yevgraf smiles, "Ah. Then it's a gift", thereby implying she truly must be Yuri and Lara's daughter after all.\
During a beach party at dusk on Amity Island,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/New_England"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 New England}}, a young woman, Chrissie Watkins, goes\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Nude_swimming"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 skinny dipping}}\'a0in the ocean.

The next day, her partial remains are found on shore. The medical examiner's ruling that the death was due to a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Shark_attack"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 shark attack}}\'a0leads police chief Martin Brody to close the beaches. Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly thereafter. A bounty is placed on the shark, prompting an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, and confirms her death was caused by a shark\'97an unusually large one.\
When local fishermen catch a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Tiger_shark"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 tiger shark}}, the mayor proclaims the beaches safe. Hooper disputes that it is the same predator, confirming this after no human remains are found inside it. Hooper and Brody find a half-sunken vessel while searching the night waters in Hooper's boat. Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Great_white_shark"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 great white shark}}'s tooth embedded in the submerged hull. He drops it in fright after encountering a partial corpse. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's claims that a huge great white shark is responsible for the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank in which the presence of a shark is simulated, the real shark enters a nearby\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Estuary"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 estuary}}, killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces Vaughn to hire Quint.\
Quint, Brody, and Hooper set out on Quint's boat, the\'a0
\f1\i Orca
\f0\i0 , to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Chumming"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 chum}}\'a0line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating its length at 25 feet (7.6\'a0m) and weight at 3 tons, harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.\
At nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars and Quint reveals that he survived the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 USS\'a0

In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he intentionally pushes the damaged engine past the safety limits and the overtaxed engine fails.\
With the\'a0

The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly and devours Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody jams a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion obliterates the shark. Hooper surfaces, and he and Brody paddle back to Amity Island clinging to the remaining barrels.\

Cleopatra (Bara), the Siren of Egypt, by a clever ruse reaches Caesar (Leiber) and he falls victim to her charms. They plan to rule the world together, but then Caesar falls. Cleopatra's life is desired by the church, as the wanton woman's rule has become intolerable. Pharon (Roscoe), a high priest, is given a sacred dagger to take her life. He gives her his love instead and, when she is in need of some money, leads her to the tomb of his ancestors, where she tears the treasure from the breast of the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Mummy"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 mummy}}. With this wealth she goes to Rome to meet Antony (Hall). He leaves the affairs of state and travels to Alexandria with her, where they revel.

They are overpowered, and flee to Alexandria. There they are captured by Octavius (De Vries), and Antony dies in Cleopatra's arms. Before Cleopatra is to be dragged behind the wheels of Octavius' chariot, Pharon the priest, who has never ceased to love her, brings her the serpent that she joyously brings to her breast, dying royally with her crown on her head and scepter in her hand as becomes Egypt.\
Mickey (Normand) is an adult orphan who has been raised since girlhood in poverty near Feather River, California by an unsuccessful miner, Joe Meadows, and his housekeeper, Minnie. Mickey is the free-spirited, uncultured daughter of the miner's deceased partner. Meadows took charge of Mickey at his dying partner's request.

Mrs. Drake is under the impression that Mickey is wealthy and well refined. When Mickey arrives at her aunt's luxurious home, the aunt is disappointed that she is not well-to-do and puts her to work as a servant. Mickey's presence there sparks an awkward love triangle involving her, her cousin (Elsie Drake), and young mining executive Herbert Thornhill (Wheeler Oakman) whom Mickey first encountered in California. Just after Mickey is sent packing, a telegram arrives for her announcing that a vein has been struck on Joe's Tomboy mine and she is suddenly worth millions. Mrs. Drake's opinion of Mickey changes quickly and she is welcomed back\'97in the hope she and Mrs Drake's feckless son, Reggie, will become a couple. Herbert had recently proposed to Elsie, but realizes he truly loves Mickey. Shortly afterward, Herbert receives a telegram from his lawyer, Tom Rawlings, explaining that his mining claims are now invalid and thus worthless. Elsie and Mrs. Drake find the telegram and call off the wedding because Herbert is now bankrupt. Herbert tries to regain his fortune by borrowing $5,000 and betting it on a horse race. The race is rigged\'97and Mickey finds out about the plot. Just as the race is about to begin, Mickey dresses in jockey silks, unhorses the crooked jockey, and tries to win the race by riding it for Herbert. Just as it appears Mickey's horse will win, she falls from her mount. Some time later Mickey reluctantly goes horseback riding with Reggie who tries to molest her in an abandoned house. Herbert arrives on the scene, battles Reggie, and rescues Mickey as she is dangling dangerously from the rooftop. Mickey and Herbert are married. As they depart on their honeymoon, a note arrives from lawyer Rawlings explaining the earlier telegram about his mining interests being worthless was a ruse designed to get Herbert out of his loveless engagement to Elsie Drake. The film ends with both Mickey and Herbert happily in love, wed, and exceedingly wealthy.\

The gang consists of Tom Burke (Thomas Meighan), the head of the group; Rose (Betty Compson), a con artist posing as a street walker; "The Dope" (J.M. Dumont), who pretends to pimp Rose; and The Frog (Lon Chaney), a contortionist.\
The plan is clear: in a small town outside of Boston there is a Patriarch (Joseph Dowling) who has been healing people. The group heads to the town and plans to use the Patriarch in a faith healing scheme. When the townspeople gather to see the Patriarch heal the sick, the Frog is there, posing as a cripple. As he crawls to the path of the man, his limbs become straightened and soon he walks to the Patriarch, supposedly healed. Unexpectedly, a crippled boy, his faith in the Patriarch overpowering him, loses his crutches and runs to the Patriarch.\
The story spreads across the country (mostly on account of Burke), and people flock in from all over to visit the Patriarch and be healed. When a millionaire, Richard King (W. Lawson Butt), brings his sister to be healed, he gives Burke $50,000 after the Patriarch cures her. During this visit, King meets Rose, and the two fall in love.\
Meanwhile, all is not well with Burke. One by one, he sees his gang disbanding because, unbeknownst to him, the healing power of the Patriarch is at work. The Dope gives up his drug addiction, The Frog gives up his life of crime and takes care of a widow left all alone, and Rose laments King's departure.\
Burke becomes jealous, but when King returns to propose marriage to Rose, she realizes that she loves Burke. The Patriarch dies, and the two lovers begin anew.\

Then Lennox shows up lusting for another local girl, Kate. Seeing Anna, he tries to get her to leave, but she refuses to go, although she promises to say nothing about his past.\
Finally, Squire Bartlett learns of Anna's past from Martha, the town gossip. In his anger, he tosses Anna out into a snow storm. Before she goes, she fingers the respected Lennox as her despoiler and the father of her dead baby. Anna becomes lost in the raging storm while David leads a search party. In the famous climax, the unconscious Anna floats on an ice floe down a river towards a waterfall, until rescued at the last moment by David, who marries her in the final scene.\

Then America enters World War I. Jim informs his worried mother that he has no intention of enlisting, and his father threatens to kick him out of the house if he does not join. However, when he runs into his patriotic friends at a send-off parade, he is persuaded to enlist, making his father very proud.\
During training, Jim makes friendships with Southern construction worker Slim ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Karl_Dane"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Karl Dane}}) and Bronx bartender Bull (Tom O'Brien).

That night, orders come down for one man to go out and eliminate a troublesome mortar crew; Slim wins a spitting contest for the opportunity. He succeeds, but is spotted and wounded on the way back. After listening to Slim's pleas for help, Jim cannot stand it any longer and goes to his rescue against orders. Bull follows, but is shot and killed. By the time Jim reaches Slim, he is already dead. Jim is then shot in the leg.

The German starts crawling back to his line. Jim catches up to him in another shellhole, but, face to face, cannot bring himself to finish him off with his bayonet. Instead, he gives his erstwhile enemy a cigarette. Soon after, the German dies.

From another patient, he learns that Champillon has changed hands four times. Worried about Melisande, Jim sneaks out of the hospital and hitches a ride. When he gets to the farmhouse, he finds it damaged and empty. Melisande and her mother have joined a stream of refugees. Jim collapses and is carried off in an ambulance by retreating soldiers.\
After the war ends, Jim goes home to America. Before he arrives, his mother overhears Justyn and Jim's brother Harry (Robert Ober) discussing what to do; in Jim's absence, they have fallen in love. When Jim appears, it is revealed that he has had his leg amputated. Later, Jim tells his mother about Melisande; she tells him to go back and find her. When he returns to the farm, Melisande rushes into his arms.\

Brother Paul, who was talking to another person about his dream to build a mission, assumes he wants to pay for the mission and tells him $1000. Though he finds that a rather hefty amount for a mere pushcart, Manners pays without complaint.\
Once Manners reads in the newspaper that he is sponsoring a mission, he goes there to dissociate himself from it. He is aghast to find it named the J. Harold Manners Mission. When he starts to tear down the sign, he is scolded by Brother Paul's pretty daughter, Hope ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Jobyna_Ralston"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Jobyna Ralston}}), who does not know who he is. Far from being offended, he is smitten with her. Thus, when Brother Paul returns and invites him inside to tour the place, he readily accepts. Hope, once she learns his identity, apologizes.\
In order to build up attendance, Manners runs through town provoking people, and winds up with a crowd chasing him right into the mission. Some of the men are in possession of the proceeds of a jewel robbery. Before they can beat him up, however, the police arrive. The quick-witted Manners takes up a "collection"; the crooks deposit their loot in the hat he is using while the police search everybody. This act earns him the friendship of the gang.\
He eventually wins the girl and they decide to get married at the mission. His high-brow friends decide to kidnap him, believing they are saving him from a terrible mistake. As they drive away, one of them tells the wedding's "reception committee" that Manners is not going to marry Hope. The disappointed committeemen get drunk. Then their leader decides to go to Manner's club to confirm the news. They free Manners and head back to the mission. Manners has his hands full shepherding five drunks, but finally gets them all there and marries Hope.\

He agrees and becomes distraught when he realizes what he has done. David consoles him and before he dies, forgives his comrade.\
At the war's end, Jack returns home to a hero's welcome. He visits David's grieving parents to return his friend's effects. During the visit he begs their forgiveness for causing David's death.

Hank, the older sister, prides herself on her business sense and talent, while Queenie is lauded for her beauty. Hank is confident they will make it big while Queenie is less eager to put everything on the line to become a star. Hank declines the offer of their Uncle Jed ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Jed_Prouty"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Jed Prouty}}) to join a 30-week traveling show but consents to think it over.\
Eddie, who is engaged to Hank, arrives and sees Queenie for the first time since she was a girl and is instantly taken with her. He tells them to come to a rehearsal for Zanfield's revue to present their act. A blond woman sabotages their performance by placing a bag in the piano, which causes a fight with Hank. Zanfield isn't interested in it, but says he might have a use for Queenie, who begs him to give Hank a part as well, saying both will work for one wage. She also convinces him to pretend that Hank's business skills won him over. Eddie witnesses this exchange and becomes even more enamored of Queenie for her devotion to her sister. During a dress rehearsal for the revue, Zanfield says the pacing is too slow for "The Broadway Melody" and cuts Hank and Queenie from the number. Meanwhile, another woman is injured after falling off a set prop and Queenie is selected to replace her. Nearly everyone is captivated by Queenie, particularly notorious playboy Jacques "Jock" Warriner ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Kenneth_Thomson_(actor)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Kenneth Thomson}}). While Jock begins to woo Queenie, Hank is upset that Queenie is building her success on her looks rather than her talent.\
Over the following weeks, Queenie spends a lot of time with Jock, of which Hank and Eddie fervently disapprove. They forbid her to see him, which results in Queenie pushing them away and the deterioration of the relationship between the sisters. Queenie is only with Jock to fight her growing feelings for Eddie, but Hank thinks she's setting herself up to be hurt. Eventually, Eddie and Queenie confess their love for each other, but Queenie, unwilling to break her sister's heart, runs off to Jock once again.\
Hank, after witnessing Queenie's fierce outburst toward Eddie and his devastated reaction to it, finally realizes that they are in love. She berates Eddie for letting Queenie run away and tells him to go after her. She claims to never have loved him and that she'd only been using him to advance her career. After he leaves, she breaks down and alternates between sobs and hysterical laughter. She composes herself enough to call Uncle Jed to accept the job with the 30-week show.\
There's a raucous party at the apartment Jock had recently purchased for Queenie, but he insists that they spend time alone. When she resists his advances, he says that it's the least that she could do after all he's done for her. He begins to get physical, but Eddie bursts in and attempts to fight Jock, who knocks him through the door with one punch. Queenie runs to Eddie and leaves Jock and the party behind.\
Sometime later, Hank and Uncle Jed await the return of Queenie and Eddie from their honeymoon. The relationship between the sisters is on the mend, but there is obvious discomfort between Hank and Eddie. Queenie announces she's through with show business and will settle down in their new house on\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Long_Island,_New_York"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Long Island}}. She insists that Hank live with them when her job is over. After Hank leaves with her new partner and Uncle Jed, Queenie laments the fact that she wasn't able to help her sister find the happiness she deserves. Ironically, Hank's new partner is the blond who tried to sabotage the act when the sisters first arrived in New York. The final scene shows Hank on her way to the train station. She promises her new partner that they'll be back on Broadway within six months.\

On the brink of becoming men, the boys in his class, led by Paul Baumer, are moved to join the army as the new 2nd Company. Their romantic delusions are quickly broken during their brief but rigorous training under the abusive Corporal Himmelstoss, who bluntly informs them, "You're going to be soldiers\'97and that's\'a0
\f1\i all
\f0\i0 ."\
The new soldiers arrive by train at the combat zone, which is mayhem, with soldiers everywhere, incoming shells, horse-drawn wagons racing about, and prolonged rain. One in the group is killed before the new recruits can reach their post, to the alarm of one of the new soldiers (Behn). The new soldiers are assigned to a unit composed of older soldiers, who are not exactly accommodating. The young soldiers find that there is no food available at the moment. They have not eaten since breakfast, but the men they have joined have not had food for two days. One of them, "Kat" Katczinsky, had gone to locate something to eat and he returns with a slaughtered hog he has stolen from a field kitchen. The young soldiers "pay" for their dinner with soaps and cigarettes.\
The new recruits' first trip to the trenches with the veterans, to re-string barbed wire, is a harrowing experience, especially when Behn is blinded by shrapnel and hysterically runs into machine-gun fire. After spending several days in a bunker under bombardment, they at last move into the trenches and successfully repulse an enemy attack; they then counterattack and take an enemy trench with heavy casualties, but have to abandon it. They are sent back to the field kitchens to get their rations; each man receives double helpings, simply because of the number of dead.\
The men start out eating greedily, but then settle into a satiated\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/torpor"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 torpor}}. They hear that they are to return to the front the next day and begin a semi-serious discussion about the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Origins_of_World_War_I"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 causes of the war}}\'a0and of wars in general. They speculate about whether geographical entities offend each other and whether these disagreements involve them. Tjaden speaks familiarly about himself and the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Wilhelm_II,_German_Emperor"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Kaiser}}; Kat jokes that instead of having a war, they should have the leaders of Europe be stripped to their underwear and "fight it out with clubs".\
One day, Corporal Himmelstoss arrives to the front and is immediately spurned because of his bad reputation; he is forced to go over the top with the 2nd Company and is promptly killed. In an attack on a cemetery, Paul stabs a French soldier, but finds himself trapped in a hole with the dying man for an entire night. Throughout the night, he desperately tries to help him, bringing him water, but fails miserably to stop him from dying. He cries bitterly and begs the dead body to speak so he can be forgiven. Later, he returns to the German lines and is comforted by Kat.\
Going back to the front line, Paul is severely wounded and taken to a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Catholic"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Catholic}}\'a0hospital, along with his good friend Albert Kropp. Kropp's leg is amputated, but he does not find out until some time afterwards. Around this time, Paul is taken to the bandaging ward, from which, according to its reputation, nobody has ever returned alive; but he later returns to the normal rooms triumphantly, only to find Kropp in depression.\
Paul is given a furlough and visits his family at home. He is shocked by how uninformed everyone is about the actual situation of the war; everyone is convinced that a final "push for Paris" is soon to occur. When Paul visits the schoolroom where he was originally recruited, he finds Professor Kantorek prattling the same patriotic fervor to a class of even younger students. Professor Kantorek asks of Paul to detail his experience, to which the latter reveals that war was not at all like he had envisioned and mentions the deaths of his partners; this revelation upsets the professor, as well as the young students who promptly call Paul a "coward". Disillusioned and angry, Paul returns to the front and comes upon another 2nd company that is filled with new young recruits who are now disillusioned; he is then happily greeted by Tjaden. He goes to find Kat, and they discuss the inability of the people to comprehend the futility of the war. Kat's shin is broken when a bomb dropped by an aircraft falls nearby, so Paul carries him back to a field hospital - only to find that Kat has been killed by a second explosion. Crushed by the loss of his mentor, Paul leaves.\
In the final scene, Paul is back on the front lines. He sees a butterfly just beyond his trench. Paul smiles and reaches out towards the butterfly, but becoming too exposed, he is shot and killed by an enemy sniper. The final shot shows the 2nd Company arriving at the front for the first time, fading out to the image of a cemetery.\

Frankenstein desires to create human life through electrical devices which he has perfected. He sends Fritz to a school where\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Doctor_Waldman"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Dr. Waldman}}, Henry's old medical professor, teaches, to steal a brain; Fritz drops the normal brain and has to take the brain of a criminal.\
Elizabeth, his fianc\'e9e, is worried over his peculiar actions. She cannot understand why he secludes himself in an abandoned watch tower, which he has equipped as a laboratory, and refuses to see anyone. She and a friend, Victor Moritz, go to Dr. Waldman, and ask Waldman's help in reclaiming the young scientist from his experiments. Waldman tells them that Frankenstein has been working on creating life. Elizabeth, intent on rescuing Frankenstein, arrives just as Henry is making his final tests. He tells them to watch, claiming to have discovered the ray that brought life into the world. They watch Frankenstein and the hunchback as they raise the dead creature on an operating table, high into the room, toward an opening at the top of the laboratory. Then a terrific crash of thunder booms, and Frankenstein's electric machines flash, crackle and buzz. Shortly, the hand of Frankenstein's creature begins to move. This prompts Frankenstein to shout 'It's alive!'.\
The manufactured creature, despite its grotesque form, initially appears to be a simple, innocent creation. Frankenstein welcomes it into his laboratory and asks his creation to sit, which it does. He then opens up the roof, causing the creature to reach out towards the sunlight. Fritz enters with a flaming torch, which frightens the creature. Its fright is mistaken by Frankenstein and Waldman as an attempt to attack them, and it is chained in the dungeon. Thinking that it is not fit for society and will wreak havoc at any chance, they leave the creature locked up, where Fritz antagonizes it with a torch. As Henry and Waldman consider the creature's fate, they hear a shriek from the dungeon. Frankenstein and Waldman run down and find that the creature has strangled Fritz. The creature lunges at the two but they escape, locking the creature inside. Realizing that the creature must be destroyed, Henry prepares an injection of a powerful drug and the two conspire to release the creature and inject it as it attacks. When the door is unlocked the creature lunges at Frankenstein as Waldman injects the drug into the creature's back. The creature falls to the floor unconscious.\
Henry collapses from exhaustion, and Elizabeth and Henry's father arrive and take him home. Henry is worried about the creature but Waldman reassures him that he will destroy it. Later, Henry is at home, recovered and preparing for his wedding while Waldman examines the creature. As he is preparing to vivisect it, the creature awakens and strangles him. It escapes from the tower and wanders through the landscape. It has a short encounter with a farmer's young daughter, Maria. She is not afraid of him and asks him to play a game with her in which they toss flowers into a lake and watch them float. The creature enjoys the game, but when they run out of flowers he thinks Maria will float as well, so he throws her into the lake where, to his puzzlement, she drowns. Upset by this outcome, the creature runs away.\
With preparations for the wedding completed, Henry is serenely happy with Elizabeth. They are to marry as soon as Waldman arrives. However, Victor rushes in, saying that Doctor Waldman has been found strangled. Henry suspects the creature. Meanwhile, the creature enters Elizabeth's room, causing her to scream. When the searchers arrive, they find Elizabeth unconscious on the bed. The creature has escaped.\
Maria's father arrives, carrying his daughter's body. He says she was murdered, and the villagers form a search party to capture the creature, and bring it to justice (dead or alive). In order to search the whole country for the creature, they split into three groups: Ludwig leads the first group into the woods, Henry leads the second group into the mountains, and the B\'fcrgermaster leads the third group by the lake. During the search, Henry becomes separated from the group and is discovered by the creature, who attacks him. The creature knocks Henry unconscious and carries him off to an old mill. The peasants hear his cries and they regroup to follow. They find the creature has climbed to the top, dragging Henry with him. The creature hurls the scientist to the ground. His fall is broken by the vanes of the windmill, saving his life. Some of the villagers hurry him to his home while the rest of the mob set the windmill ablaze, killing the entrapped creature inside.\
At Castle Frankenstein, Frankenstein's father, Baron Frankenstein, celebrates the wedding of his recovered son with a toast to a future grandchild.\
Citizens and dignitaries are assembled for the unveiling of a new monument to "Peace and Prosperity". After droning speeches the veil is lifted to reveal the Little Tramp asleep in the lap of one of the sculpted figures. After several minutes of slapstick he manages to escape the assembly's wrath to perambulate the city. He rebukes two newsboys who taunt him for his shabbiness, and while coyly admiring a nude statue has a near-fatal encounter with a sidewalk elevator.\
The Tramp encounters the beautiful flower girl on a street-corner and in the course of buying a flower realizes she is blind; he is instantly smitten. Through an aural coincidence the girl mistakes her customer for the wealthy owner of a chauffeured automobile.\
That evening the Tramp saves a drunken millionaire from suicide. The millionaire takes his new best friend back to his mansion for champagne, then (after another abortive suicide attempt) out for a night on the town. After helping the millionaire home the next morning, he sees the flower girl en route to her street-corner. The Tramp gets some money from the millionaire and catches up to the girl; he buys all her flowers and drives her home in the millionaire's car.\
After the Tramp leaves, the flower girl tells her grandmother ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Florence_Lee_(born_1864)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Florence Lee}}) about her kind and wealthy friend. Meanwhile, the Tramp returns to the mansion, where the millionaire\'a0\'96 now sober\'a0\'96 does not remember him and has him thrown out. Later that day, the millionaire is once more intoxicated and, seeing the Tramp on the street, invites him home for a lavish party. But the next morning history repeats itself: the millionaire is again sober and the Tramp is again out on his ear.\
Finding that the girl is not at her usual street-corner, the Tramp goes to her apartment, where he overhears a doctor tell the grandmother that the girl is very ill: "She has a fever and needs careful attention." Determined to help, the Tramp takes a job as a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Street_sweeper"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 street sweeper}}.\
On his lunch break he brings the girl groceries while her grandmother is out selling flowers. To entertain her he reads a newspaper aloud; in it is a story about a Viennese doctor's blindness cure. "Wonderful, then I'll be able to see you," says the girl\'a0\'96 and the Tramp is struck by what may happen should she gain her sight and discover that he is not the wealthy man she imagines. He also finds an eviction notice the girl's grandmother has hidden. As he leaves, he promises the girl that he will pay the rent.\
The Tramp returns to work to find himself fired\'a0\'96 he has been late once too often. A boxer convinces him to fight in a fake bout; they will "go easy" on each other and split the prize money. After the boxer flees after learning he is about to be arrested, he is replaced by a no-nonsense fighter who knocks the Tramp out despite the Tramp's creative and nimble efforts to keep out of reach.\
The Tramp encounters the drunken millionaire a third time and is again invited to the mansion. The Tramp relates the girl's plight and the millionaire gives him money for her operation. Two burglars knock the millionaire out and flee with the rest of his money. The police find the Tramp with the money given him by the millionaire, who because of the knock on the head does not remember giving it. The Tramp evades the police long enough to get the money to the girl, telling her he will be going away for a time, but in due course he is apprehended and imprisoned.\
Months later the Tramp is released. He goes to the girl's customary street corner but she is not there. We learn that the girl\'a0\'96 her sight restored\'a0\'96 now runs a busy flower shop with her grandmother. But she has not forgotten her mysterious benefactor, whom she imagines to be rich and handsome: when an elegant man enters the shop she wonders for a moment if "he" has returned.\
The Tramp happens by the shop, where the girl is arranging flowers in the window. He stoops to retrieve a flower discarded in the gutter. After a brief skirmish with his old nemeses, the newsboys, he turns to the shop's window though which he suddenly sees the girl, who has been watching him without (of course) knowing who he is. At the sight of her he is frozen for a few seconds, then breaks into a broad smile. The girl is flattered and giggles to her employee: "I've made a conquest!" Via pantomime through the glass, she kindly offers him a fresh flower (to replace the crushed one he took from the gutter) and a coin.\
Suddenly embarrassed, the Tramp starts to shuffle away, but the girl steps to the shop door and again offers the flower, which he shyly accepts. She takes his hand and presses the coin into it, but abruptly she stops; her smile turns to a look of puzzlement. She runs her fingers along his arm, his shoulder, his lapels, then catches her breath: "You?" The Tramp nods with an uncertain smile and asks, "You can see now?" The girl replies, "Yes, I can see now" and tearfully pulls his hand to her bosom. The uncertainty on the Tramp's face turns to joy as the film fades to black.\

When Kong notices and starts pulling them back up, the two fall unharmed. They run through the jungle and back to the village, where Denham, Englehorn, and the surviving crewmen are waiting. Kong, following, breaks open the gate and relentlessly rampages through the village. Onshore, Denham, now determined to bring Kong back alive, knocks him unconscious with a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Chemical_warfare"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 gas bomb}}.\

Ann and Jack are brought on stage to join him, surrounded by a group of press photographers. Kong, believing that the ensuing flash photography is an attack, breaks loose. The audience flees in horror. Ann is whisked away to a hotel room on a high floor, but Kong, scaling the building, soon finds her.

At its top, he is attacked by four airplanes. Kong destroys one, but finally succumbs to their gunfire. He ensures Ann's safety before falling to his death. Ann and Jack are reunited.

He ends up falling for her himself. Tira and Jack\'92s romance leads to a wedding engagement.\
Tira tells Big Bill she is quitting to get married. Unwilling to lose his prize act, he has Slick, recently released from prison, sneak into Tira's penthouse suite, where Jack finds him in his robe. As a result, Jack breaks off the engagement. Tira sues Jack for breach of promise. The defense tries to use her past relationships to discredit her, but the judge allows her to cross examine the witnesses herself and in doing so she wins over not only the judge and jury, but also Jack. Jack agrees to give her a big settlement check. When he goes to see her, Tira tears up the check, and the two reconcile.\
On the last day of 1899, Jane and Robert Marryot, an upper-class couple, return to their townhouse in a fashionable area of London before midnight, so they can keep their tradition of celebrating the new year with a midnight toast. Although Jane and Robert have been married for some years and have two young sons, Edward and Joey, they are still very much in love. Jane worries because Robert has joined the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/City_of_London_Imperial_Volunteers"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 City of London Imperial Volunteers}}\'a0(CIV) as an officer, and will soon be leaving to serve in the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Second_Boer_War"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Second Boer War}}, where Jane's brother is already fighting in the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Siege_of_Mafeking"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Siege of Mafeking}}. Downstairs, the Marryots' butler Alfred Bridges mixes punch for their toast, while Cook dons her finest outfit to attend the public outdoor celebrations. Alfred has joined the CIV as a private and is also leaving soon. His wife Ellen, the Marryots' maid, worries about what will become of her and their new baby Fanny if Alfred is killed or seriously injured, but he is confident despite the pessimistic predictions of Ellen's elderly mother, Mrs. Snapper. At midnight, the Marryot and Bridges families ring in the new century while Cook dances with other revelers in the street.\
Shortly thereafter, Jane bids an emotional farewell to Robert at the dock when he boards the troop ship bound for Africa, while Ellen tearfully sees off Alfred, who is leaving on the same ship. While Robert is away, Jane's friend Margaret Harris keeps her company and gives her emotional support. Margaret's young daughter Edith plays Boer War games with Edward and Joey Marryot using toy soldiers and cannons, which distresses Jane. While Jane and Margaret are attending a comic\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Operetta"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 operetta}}\'a0at the theatre to take Jane's mind off the war, the relief of Mafeking is announced from the stage, and the audience cheers.

Upon his arrival, Alfred announces to his wife and mother-in-law that he has bought his own pub with money partly provided by Robert, and he and Ellen will be leaving service and moving to a flat, along with Fanny and Mrs. Snapper. As the downstairs staff have a cup of tea to celebrate Alfred's return, they receive news of the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Queen_Victoria#Death_and_succession"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 death}}\'a0of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Queen_Victoria"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Queen Victoria}}.

Ellen and Fanny, now a schoolgirl, are embarrassed and put off by Alfred's drinking and slovenly appearance. Ellen carefully plans a genteel social evening when Jane Marryot and her son Edward, who is now in college at\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/University_of_Oxford"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Oxford}}, pay a visit to the Bridges' flat. Ellen does not tell Alfred about the visit and lies to the Marryots that he can't attend due to a leg injury, but just as the Marryots are leaving, Alfred shows up drunk, acts rudely and destroys a doll that Jane had given Fanny, causing Fanny to run away into the street, where she distracts herself by dancing with some\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Pearlies"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Pearlies}}.

The following year, on July 25, 1909, Ellen and Fanny Bridges encounter the Marryot family again at the seaside, where Ellen explains that she and Fanny are living off the proceeds from the pub, now owned by Ellen. Fanny has become a talented dancer and singer. Edward Marryot has fallen in love with his childhood playmate Edith Harris. The family witnesses the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Louis_Bl%C3%A9riot#1909_Channel_crossing"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 historic flight}}\'a0by\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Louis_Bl%C3%A9riot"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Louis Bl\'e9riot}}\'a0over the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/English_Channel"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 English Channel}}.\

Robert and Joe Marryot both serve as officers, thinking the war will be over within a few months. While on leave, Joe happens upon Fanny Bridges, whom he remembers from their childhood, performing as a featured singer and dancer in a nightclub. He re-introduces himself to her, and they bond while witnessing a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/German_strategic_bombing_during_World_War_I"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Zeppelin air raid}}\'a0on London from the rooftop. She later becomes the star of a theatrical production. Fanny and Joe fall in love and Joe, who miraculously manages to survive the next four years of the war despite all his fellow officers being killed in action, spends most of his leave time with her, unbeknownst to his parents.

Following the war, a montage shows daily life becoming even more chaotic and the social order being further disrupted, while some advocate that mankind work towards peace. The film ends on New Year's Day 1933, with Jane and Robert, now elderly, carrying on their tradition of celebrating the new year with a midnight toast to their past memories, as well as to the future.\

But Lou is a lady with more men friends than anyone might imagine.\
What she does not know is that Gus trafficks in prostitution and runs a counterfeiting ring to help finance her expensive diamonds. He also sends young women to\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/San_Francisco"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 San Francisco}}\'a0to be pickpockets. Gus works with two other crooked entertainer-assistants, Russian Rita ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Rafaela_Ottiano"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Rafaela Ottiano}}) and Rita's lover, the suave Sergei Stanieff ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Gilbert_Roland"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Gilbert Roland}}). One of Gus's rivals and former "friend" of Lou's, named Dan Flynn ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/David_Landau_(actor)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 David Landau}}), spends most of the movie dropping hints to Lou that Gus is up to no good, promising to look after her once Gus is in jail. Lou leads him on, hinting at times that she will return to him, but eventually he loses patience and implies he'll see her jailed if she doesn't submit to him.\
A city mission is located next door to the bar. Its young director, Captain Cummings ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Cary_Grant"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Cary Grant}}), is in reality an undercover\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Federal_government_of_the_United_States"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Federal}}\'a0agent working to infiltrate and expose the illegal activities in the bar. Gus suspects nothing; he worries only that Cummings will reform his bar and scare away his customers.\
Lou's former boyfriend, Chick Clark ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Owen_Moore"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Owen Moore}}), is a vicious criminal who was convicted of robbery and sent to prison for trying to steal diamonds for her. In his absence, she becomes attracted to the handsome young psalm-singing reformer.\
Warned that Chick thinks she's betrayed him, she goes to the prison to try to reassure him. All the inmates greet her warmly and familiarly as she walks down the cellblock. Chick becomes angry and threatens to kill her if she double-crosses or two-times him before he gets out. She lies and claims she has been true to him. Gus gives counterfeit money to Rita and Sergei to spend. Chick escapes from jail, and police search for him in the bar. He comes into Lou's room and starts to strangle her, breaking off only because he still loves her and cannot harm her. Lou calms him down by promising that she will go with him when she finishes her next number.\
After Sergei gives Lou a diamond pin belonging to Rita, Rita starts a fight with Lou, who accidentally stabs her to death. Lou calmly combs the dead woman's long hair to hide the fact Rita is dead while the police search the room for Chick Clark. She has her bodyguard Spider ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Dewey_Robinson"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Dewey Robinson}}), who "would do anything for you, Lou" dispose of Rita's body. She then tells Spider to bring Chick, who's hiding in an alley, back to her room upstairs. Then, while she sings "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Frankie_and_Johnny_(song)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Frankie and Johnny}}", she silently signals to Dan Flynn that he should go to her room to wait for her, even though she knows Chick is in there with a gun. Chick shoots Dan dead and the gunfire draws a police raid. Cummings shows his badge and reveals himself as "The Hawk", a well-known Federal agent, as he arrests Gus and Sergei. Chick, still lurking in Lou's room, is about to kill Lou for double-crossing him, when Cummings also apprehends him.\

Spoiled heiress Ellen "Ellie" Andrews has eloped with pilot and fortune-hunter King Westley against the wishes of her extremely wealthy father, Alexander Andrews. Andrews wants to have the marriage annulled because he knows Westley is really only interested in her money. Jumping ship in Florida, she runs away and boards a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Greyhound_Lines"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Greyhound bus}}\'a0to New York City to reunite with her husband. She meets fellow bus passenger Peter Warne, a freshly out-of-work newspaper reporter. Soon Peter recognizes her and gives her a choice: If she will give him an exclusive on her story, he will help her reunite with Westley. If not, he will tell her father where she is. Ellie agrees to the first choice.\
As they go through several adventures together, Ellie loses her initial disdain for him and begins to fall in love.

Nearing the end of their journey, Ellie confesses her love to Peter. When the owners of the motel in which they are staying notice that Peter's car is gone, they expel Ellie. Believing Peter has deserted her, Ellie telephones her father, who agrees to let her marry Westley. Meanwhile, Peter has obtained money from his editor to marry Ellie, but he misses her on the road. Although Ellie has no desire to be with Westley, she believes Peter has betrayed her for the reward money and agrees to have a second, formal wedding (with Westley).\
On the wedding day, she finally reveals the whole story to her father. When Peter comes to Ellie's home, Andrews offers him the reward money, but Peter insists on being paid only his expenses: a paltry $39.60 for items he had had to sell to buy gasoline. When Ellie's father presses him for an explanation of his odd behavior and demands to know if he loves her, Peter first tries to dodge the questions, but then admits he loves Ellie and storms out. Westley arrives for his wedding via\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Autogyro"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 autogyro}}; but at the ceremony, Andrews reveals to his daughter Peter's refusal of the reward money, and tells her that her car is waiting by the back gate in case she changes her mind about going through with the wedding. Ellie dumps Westley at the altar and bolts for her car, driving away as the newsreel cameras crank.\
A few days later, Andrews is working at his desk when Westley calls to tell him he is taking the financial settlement he was offered and won't contest the annulment. His executive assistant brings him a telegram from Peter, which says, "What's holding up the annulment, you slowpoke? The walls of Jericho are toppling!", referring to a makeshift wall made of a blanket over a wire tied across the rooms they slept in between them to give them privacy. With the annulment in hand, Andrews sends the reply, "Let 'em topple."\
In the last scene, we see Peter's battered Model T parked in a motor court in Glen Falls, Michigan. The mom and pop owners of the motor court talk, wondering why on such a warm night the newlyweds\'a0\'96 he had seen the marriage license\'a0\'96 wanted a clothesline, an extra blanket, and the little tin trumpet he had gotten for them.

During the voyage, the enmity between Christian and Bligh grows after Christian openly challenges Bligh's unjust practices aboard the ship. When the ship arrives at the island of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Tahiti"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Tahiti}}, where the crew acquires breadfruit plants to take to the West Indies, as intended, Bligh punishes Christian by refusing to let him leave the ship during their stay. Byam, meanwhile, sets up residency on the island, living with the island chief, Hitihiti (William Bambridge), and his daughter, Tehani ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Movita_Castaneda"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Movita Castaneda}}), and compiling an English dictionary of the Tahitian language. Hitihiti persuades Bligh to allow Christian a day pass on the island. Bligh agrees but quickly repeals the pass out of spite. Christian disregards the order and spends his one-day off the ship romancing a Tahitian girl, Maimiti ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Mamo_Clark"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Mamo Clark}}). Christian promises her he will be back someday.\
After leaving Tahiti the crew begins to talk of mutiny after Bligh's harsh discipline leads to the death of the ship's beloved surgeon, Mr.\'a0Bacchus ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Dudley_Digges_(actor)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Dudley Digges}}), and Bligh severely cuts water rationing to the crew in favor of providing more water for the breadfruit plants. Christian, although initially opposing the idea, decides he can no longer tolerate Bligh's brutality when he witnesses crew members shackled in iron chains, and he approves the mutiny. The crew raids the weapons cabinet and seizes the ship. Bligh and his loyalists are cast into a boat and set adrift at sea with a map and rations to ensure their survival. Due to Bligh's steady leadership, they are able to find their way back to land.\
Meanwhile, Christian orders that\'a0

Months later, Byam is married to Tehani and Christian has married Maimiti and has a child with her, while the rest of the crew are enjoying their freedom on the island. After a long estrangement, Byam and Christian reconcile their friendship. However, when the British ship\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/HMS_Pandora_(1779)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 HMS\'a0

Byam boards\'a0

Bligh, who suspects that Byam was complicit in the mutiny, has him imprisoned for the remainder of the journey across the sea. Back in England Byam is court-martialed and found guilty of mutiny. Before the court condemns him, Byam speaks of Bligh's cruel, dehumanising conduct aboard\'a0

Despite Father Tim's best efforts, Blackie remains a jaunty Barbary Coast atheist, although Blackie secretly paid for the new organ in Father Tim's church.\
Blackie's feelings for Mary intensify, but complications arise when she is offered an opportunity to sing in the opera. Although she initially refuses to break her contract with Blackie, she later leaves the\'a0
\f1\i Paradise Club
\f0\i0 \'a0due to the overtly sexual manifestation of Blackie's feelings for her.\
Mary is hired by the Tivoli Opera House on Market Street. There she becomes involved with\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Nob_Hill"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Nob Hill}}\'a0scion Jack Burley ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Jack_Holt_(actor)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Jack Holt}}). Blackie wants to stop Mary singing at the Tivoli: he arrives the night of her premiere with a process server in tow to shut down the show. However, when he hears her sing he decides not to stop the opera. After her performance, Blackie visits Mary in her dressing room. Realizing she still loves him, Mary forwardly asks him to marry her. Blackie agrees, but their reunion is soon interrupted by Burley, who had proclaimed his love for Mary and proposed to her prior to the show. Blackie, seeing Burley as competition for Mary's affections, is happy to tell him of their intent to marry. However, as Blackie gloatingly tells Burley of their plans, it becomes clear that Blackie intends to take Mary away from the Tivoli and put her back on stage at the\'a0
\f1\i Paradise
\f0\i0 . Burley appeals to Mary, but Blackie presents Mary with an ultimatum by asking if she wants to marry him or stay at the Tivoli.\
Mary's choice is to return to the\'a0
\f1\i Paradise
\f0\i0 . Backstage, before the opening night of her return performance, she asks Blackie if they can set the date for their wedding. Blackie agrees, but wants to postpone getting married until after the election. Father Tim drops in, and is angered by Mary's skimpy stage costume. He defies Blackie to put her on the stage in front of the rowdy\'a0

\f0\i0 \'a0audience. Mary observes Blackie's reaction to Father Tim's statements, and decides to leave with the priest after Blackie strikes him in the face.\
Mary goes back to Burley and eventually meets his mother ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Jessie_Ralph"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Jessie Ralph}}) at her\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Nob_Hill"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Nob Hill}}\'a0mansion.

Mrs. Burley also empathizes that she also once had a "Blackie" in her younger days, but chose to marry the more steadfast elder Burley.

Blackie then comes upon Mat, who was injured at the destroyed Hall of Justice on Washington Street. A nurse indicates to Blackie that Mat is dying.

After seeing Mary, Blackie falls to his knees and thanks God for sparing Mary's life. From a distance, Mary sees Blackie praying, and as she walks toward him, word spreads through the camp that "The fire's out!" As people shout about building a new San Francisco, Blackie and Mary join the crowd (a surprisingly multi-racial group, given the era of the film) as they leave the park marching arm-in-arm, singing "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/The_Battle_Hymn_of_the_Republic"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 The Battle Hymn of the Republic}}".\

Using a potion to disguise herself as an old\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Hag"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 hag}}, the Queen creates a poisoned apple that will put whoever eats it into the "Sleeping Death", a curse she learns can only be broken by "love's first kiss", but is certain Snow White will be buried alive. While the Queen goes to the cottage while the dwarfs are away, the animals are wary of her and rush off to find the dwarfs. Faking a potential heart attack, the Queen tricks Snow White into bringing her into the cottage to rest. The Queen fools Snow White into biting into the poisoned apple under the pretense that it is a magic apple that grants wishes. As Snow White falls asleep, the Queen proclaims that she is now the fairest of the land. The dwarfs return with the animals as the Queen leaves the cottage and give chase, trapping her on a cliff. She tries to roll a boulder over them, but before she can do so, lightning strikes the cliff, causing her to fall to her death.\
The dwarfs return to their cottage and find Snow White seemingly dead, being kept in a deathlike slumber by the poison. Unwilling to bury her out of sight in the ground, they instead place her in a glass coffin trimmed with gold in a clearing in the forest. Together with the woodland creatures, they keep watch over her. A year later, a prince who had previously met and fallen in love with Snow White learns of her eternal sleep and visits her coffin. Saddened by her apparent death, he kisses her, which breaks the spell and awakens her. The dwarfs and animals all rejoice as the Prince takes Snow White to his castle.\
A successful banker, Anthony P. Kirby ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Edward_Arnold_(actor)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Edward Arnold}}), has just returned from\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Washington,_D.C."}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Washington, D.C.}}, where he was effectively granted a government-sanctioned\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Munitions"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 munitions}}\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Monopoly"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 monopoly}}, which will make him very rich. He intends to buy up a 12-block radius around a competitor's factory to put him out of business, but there is one house that is a holdout to selling. Kirby instructs his real estate broker, John Blakely ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Clarence_Wilson_(actor)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Clarence Wilson}}), to offer a huge sum for the house, and if that is not accepted, to cause trouble for the family. Meanwhile Grandpa Vanderhof ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Lionel_Barrymore"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Lionel Barrymore}}) convinces a banker named Poppins to pursue his dream of making animated toys.\
Kirby's son, Tony ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/James_Stewart"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 James Stewart}}), a vice president in the family company, has fallen in love with a company\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Stenographer"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 stenographer}}, Alice Sycamore ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Jean_Arthur"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Jean Arthur}}). When Tony proposes marriage, Alice is worried that her family would be looked upon poorly by Tony's rich and famous family. In fact, Alice is the only relatively normal member of the eccentric Sycamore family, led by Vanderhof. Unbeknownst to the players, Alice's family lives in the house that will not sell out.\
Kirby and his wife ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Mary_Forbes"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Mary Forbes}}) strongly disapprove of Tony's choice for marriage. Before she accepts, Alice forces Tony to bring his family to become better acquainted with their future in-laws. But when Tony purposely brings his family on the wrong day, the Sycamore family is caught off-guard and the house is in disarray. As the Kirbys are preparing to leave after a rather disastrous meeting, the police arrive in response to the printed threats on Ed Carmichael's flyers, and when the fireworks in the basement go off, they arrest everyone in the house.\

At the court hearing, the judge ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Harry_Davenport_(actor)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Harry Davenport}}) allows for Grandpa and his family to settle the charges for disturbing the peace and making illegal fireworks by assessing a fine, which Grandpa's friends pitch in to pay for. He repeatedly asks why the Kirbys were at the Vanderhof house. When Grandpa says it was to talk over selling the house, Alice has an outburst and says it was because she was engaged to Tony but is spurning him because of how poorly she has been treated by his family. This causes a sensation in the papers, and Alice flees the city.\
With Alice gone, Grandpa decides to sell the house, thus meaning the whole section of the town must vacate in preparation for building a new factory. Now, the Kirby companies merge, creating a huge fluctuation in the stock market. When Kirby's competitor, Ramsey ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/H._B._Warner"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 H. B.

As the Vanderhofs are moving out of the house, Tony tries to track down Alice. Kirby arrives and talks privately with Grandpa, sharing his realization. Grandpa responds by inviting him to play "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Polly_Wolly_Doodle"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Polly Wolly Doodle}}" on the harmonica that he gave him. The two let loose with the rest of the family joining in the merriment, and with Alice taking Tony back. Later, at the dinner table, Grandpa says grace for the Sycamore family and the Kirbys, revealing that Kirby has sold back the houses on the block.\

At the Twelve Oaks party, Scarlett privately declares her feelings to Ashley, but he rebuffs her by responding that he and Melanie are more compatible. Scarlett is incensed when she discovers another guest,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Rhett_Butler"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Rhett Butler}}, has overheard their conversation. The barbecue is disrupted by the declaration of war and the men rush to enlist. As Scarlett watches Ashley kiss Melanie goodbye, Melanie's younger brother Charles proposes to her.

Celebrating a Confederate victory and to raise money for the Confederate war effort, gentlemen are invited to bid for ladies to dance with them.

Afterwards, Scarlett calls upon Rhett to take her home to Tara with Melanie, her baby, and Prissy; he collects them in a horse and wagon, but once out of the city chooses to go off to fight, leaving Scarlett and the group to make their own way back to Tara. Upon her return home, Scarlett finds Tara deserted, except for her father, her sisters, and two former slaves: Mammy and Pork. Scarlett learns that her mother has just died of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Typhoid_fever"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 typhoid fever}}and her father has become incompetent. With Tara pillaged by Union troops and the fields untended, Scarlett vows she will do anything for the survival of her family and herself.\

With Frank's funeral barely over, Rhett proposes to Scarlett and she accepts. They have a daughter whom Rhett names Bonnie Blue, but Scarlett, still pining for Ashley and chagrined at the perceived ruin of her figure, lets Rhett know that she wants no more children and that they will no longer share a bed.\
One day at Frank's mill, Scarlett and Ashley are seen embracing by Ashley's sister, India, and harboring an intense dislike of Scarlett she eagerly spreads rumors. Later that evening, Rhett, having heard the rumors, forces Scarlett to attend a birthday party for Ashley. Incapable of believing anything bad of her, Melanie stands by Scarlett's side so that all know that she believes the gossip to be false. After returning home from the party, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk, and they argue about Ashley. Rhett kisses Scarlett against her will, stating his intent to have sex with her that night, and carries the struggling Scarlett to the bedroom. The next day, Rhett apologizes for his behavior and offers Scarlett a divorce, which she rejects, saying that it would be a disgrace. When Rhett returns from an extended trip to London, Scarlett informs him that she is pregnant, but an argument ensues which results in her falling down a flight of stairs and suffering a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Miscarriage"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 miscarriage}}.

Before falling asleep, Geppetto makes a wish on a star that Pinocchio be a real boy.

However, on his way to school, Pinocchio is led astray by\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/The_Fox_and_the_Cat"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Honest John the Fox and his companion, Gideon the Cat}}, who convince him to join\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Stromboli_(Pinocchio)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Stromboli}}'s puppet show, despite Jiminy's objections. Pinocchio becomes Stromboli's star attraction as a marionette who can sing and dance without strings. However, when Pinocchio wants to go home for the night, Stromboli locks him in a birdcage. Jiminy arrives to see Pinocchio, and is unable to free him. The Blue Fairy appears, and asks Pinocchio why he was not at school. Jiminy urges Pinocchio to tell the truth, but instead he starts telling lies, which causes his nose to grow longer and longer. Pinocchio vows to be good from now on, and the Blue Fairy returns his nose to its original form and sets him free, while warning him that this will be the last time she can help him.\

Jiminy runs back to warn Pinocchio, only to discover that Lampwick has transformed into a donkey; Pinocchio manages to escape, only partially transformed.\
Upon returning home, Pinocchio and Jiminy find the workshop vacant. They soon get a letter from the blue fairy as a dove, stating that Geppetto had ventured out to sea to save Pinocchio from Pleasure Island, but was swallowed by a terrible\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Sperm_whale"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 giant whale}}\'a0named\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/The_Terrible_Dogfish"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Monstro}}, and is now living in his belly. Determined to rescue his father, Pinocchio jumps into the sea accompanied by Jiminy. Pinocchio is soon swallowed by Monstro as well, where he is reunited with Geppetto. Pinocchio devises a scheme to make Monstro sneeze, giving them a chance to escape. The scheme works, but the enraged whale-monster chases them and smashes their raft. Pinocchio pulls Geppetto to safety in a cave before Monstro crashes into it. Geppetto, Figaro, Cleo, and Jiminy are washed up safely on a beach, but Pinocchio is killed.\
Back home, Geppetto grieves over Pinocchio with Jiminy Cricket and the pets also mourn alongside. The Blue Fairy, however, decides that Pinocchio has proven himself brave, truthful, and unselfish. To reward him, the Blue Fairy resurrects Pinocchio, reversing the Pleasure Island curse and turning him into a real boy. Pinocchio awakens and reveals that he is alive and a real human boy, and everyone celebrates. Jiminy steps outside to thank the Fairy, and is rewarded with a solid gold badge that certifies him as an official conscience.\

When Elizabeth 'Betsy' Bartlett ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Claudette_Colbert"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Claudette Colbert}}) shows up, McMasters sweeps her off her feet (without knowing that Sand considers her his girl) and marries her. Sand accepts the situation, wanting Betsy to be happy. However, on their first anniversary, she catches her husband dancing with a barroom floozy. As a result, Sand quarrels with McMasters and they flip a coin for the entire oilfield. Betsy leaves too, but returns when she learns that her husband has lost almost everything to Sand and needs her.\
Each man goes through booms and busts. Building on his renewed success as a wildcatter, McMasters moves to New York to expand into refineries and distribution, competing against former customer Harry Compton ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Lionel_Atwill"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Lionel Atwill}}). Seeking inside information about his rivals, he hires away Compton's adviser Karen Vanmeer ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Hedy_Lamarr"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Hedy Lamarr}}), who uses her social contacts and womanly charms to gather industry information.\
Meanwhile, Sand loses everything he has built up in South America to a revolution. When he meets McMasters at an oilmen's convention, the two finally reconcile, and Sand goes to work for his old friend. When he suspects that McMasters is carrying on an affair with Karen, he tries to save Betsy's marriage by offering to marry Karen. However, she deduces his motives and declines. When a miserable Betsy tries to commit suicide by taking sleeping pills, Sand decides that the only way to help her is to bankrupt McMasters. Sand loses his costly battle with his former friend and goes broke. It is only when he asks McMasters to give his wife a divorce that the married man finally comes to his senses. Later, McMasters is prosecuted by the government for violating the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Sherman_Antitrust_Act"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Sherman Antitrust Act}}\'a0and loses his business. In the end, poor, but happier, Sand and McMasters team up again, with the blissful Betsy looking on. Aldrich supplies them with equipment and the whole cycle begins again.\
Alvin York, a poor young farmer from the rural area near\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Pall_Mall,_Tennessee"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Pall Mall, Tennessee}}, lives a hardscrabble existence in a community whose poverty and isolation leave them with a lifestyle hardly different from people of a century earlier. He is an exceptional marksman, but a ne'er-do-well prone to drinking and fighting, which does not make things any easier for his long-suffering, widowed mother.\
Alvin's farm is on rocky land high in the mountains, which barely supports him and his siblings. He meets a sweet-natured local girl, Gracie Williams, and works night and day at strenuous odd jobs to accumulate the payment for a fertile "bottomland" farm so she'll marry him. The owner, Tomkins, gives Alvin sixty days to raise the purchase price. On the day the last payment is due, Alvin wins the final needed amount at a target-shooting contest, but discovers Tomkins has reneged and sold the farm to Alvin's romantic rival, Zeb Andrews, keeping all of the partial payments Alvin had made. Alvin drinks heavily and swears revenge.\
That night, en route to attack Tomkins and Andrews, the rifle Alvin is holding is struck by lightning, splitting the barrel in two and knocking him off his mule.

He gives York a leave to go home and think it over. He promises York a recommendation for his exemption as a conscientious objector if York remains unconvinced.\
While York is fasting and pondering, the wind blows his Bible open to the verse "Render therefore unto Caesar the things which are Caesar's; and unto God the things that are God's." York reports back for duty and tells his superiors that he can serve his country, despite not having everything figured out to his satisfaction, leaving the matter in\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/God"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 God}}'s hands.\

Pinned down by deadly machine gun fire, the lieutenant orders Sergeant Early to take some men and try to attack the machine gun nests from behind.

Seeing his comrades being shot down all around him, his self-doubt disappears. He works his way to a position flanking the main enemy trench and, as a sniper, fires individual rifle shots with such devastating effect that the Germans surrender. Then, York forces a captured officer at gunpoint to order the Germans still fighting in another section of the line to also surrender. He and the handful of other survivors end up with 132 prisoners. York becomes a national hero and is awarded the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Medal_of_Honor"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Medal of Honor}}.

Arriving in New York City in early 1919, York receives a ticker tape parade and a key to the city. He is impressed with the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Waldorf-Astoria_hotel"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Waldorf-Astoria hotel}}\'a0and its indoor electricity.

York mentions the bottomland he wanted and Hull responds he could buy it with the money. York rejects the offers, however, saying that he was not proud of what he did in the war, but it had to be done, and he will not profit from his fame. He tells Hull he wants to go home. He returns to\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Tennessee"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Tennessee}}\'a0greeted by Gracie and his family. To his surprise, the people of his home state have bought him the bottomland farm he wanted and built him a house on the land.\
A doe gives birth to a fawn named Bambi, who will one day take over the position of Great Prince of the Forest, a title currently held by Bambi's father, who guards the woodland creatures from the dangers of hunters. The fawn is quickly befriended by an eager, energetic rabbit named\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Thumper_(Bambi)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Thumper}}, who helps to teach him to walk and speak.

Curious and inquisitive, Bambi frequently asks about the world around him and is cautioned about the dangers of life as a forest creature by his loving mother. One day out in a meadow, Bambi briefly sees The Great Prince but does not realize that he is his father. As the great prince wanders uphill, he discovers the human hunter named "Man" by all the animals is coming and rushes down to the meadow to get everyone to safety. Bambi is briefly separated from his mother during that scene but is escorted to her by the Great Prince as the three of them make it back in the forest just as Man fires his gun.\
During Bambi's first winter, he and Thumper play in the snow while Flower hibernates. One day his mother takes him along to find food, when Man shows up again. As they escape his mother is shot and killed by the hunter, leaving the little fawn mournful and alone. Taking pity on his abandoned son, the Great Prince leads Bambi home as he reveals to him that he is his father. Next year, Bambi has matured into a young stag, and his childhood friends have entered young adulthood as well. They are warned of "twitterpation" by Friend Owl and that they will eventually fall in love, although the trio view the concept of romance with scorn. However, Thumper and Flower soon both encounter their beautiful romantic counterparts and abandon their former thoughts on love. Bambi himself encounters Faline as a beautiful doe. However, their courtship is quickly interrupted and challenged by a belligerent older stag named Ronno, who attempts to force Faline away from Bambi. Bambi successfully manages to defeat Ronno in battle and earn the rights to the doe's affections.\
Bambi is awakened shortly afterward by the smell of smoke, he follows it and discovers it leads to a hunter camp. Bambi is warned by his father that Man has returned with more hunters. The two flee to safety, although Bambi is separated from Faline in the turmoil and searches for her along the way. He soon finds her cornered by Man's vicious hunting dogs, which he manages to ward off. Meanwhile, at the "Man's" camp their campfire, unattended, spreads into the forest, resulting in a wildfire from which the forest residents flee in fear. Bambi, his father, Faline, and the forest animals manage to reach shelter on a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Bank_(geography)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 riverbank}}.

Despite initial disagreements\'97mainly contrasting Vin's idealistic attitude to class differences with Carol's practical altruism\'97they fall in love. Vin proposes to Carol in front of his family at home, after his younger brother prods him to give a less romantic, but more honest, proposal. As the war comes closer to home, Vin feels he must "do his bit", and enlists in the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Royal_Air_Force"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Royal Air Force}}, qualifying as a fighter pilot. He is posted to a base near to his parents' home, and is able to signal his safe return from operations to his parents by "blipping" his engine briefly (rapidly open and closing the throttle, which results in short, sharp roars of sound) as he flies over the house. Together with other boat owners, Clem volunteers to take his motorboat, the\'a0

She feeds him, calmly disarms him when he collapses, and then calls the police. Soon after, Clem returns home, exhausted, from Dunkirk.\
Lady Beldon visits Kay to try and convince her to talk Vin out of marrying Carol on account of her granddaughter's comparative youth at age eighteen. Kay reminds Her Ladyship that she, too, had been young \'97 sixteen, in fact \'97 when she married her late husband. Lady Beldon concedes defeat, and realizes that it would be futile to try to stop the marriage. Vin and Carol marry; Carol has now also become a Mrs Miniver, and they return from their honeymoon in\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Scotland"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Scotland}}.

As air raid sirens sound, and the villagers take refuge in the cellars of Beldon Hall, Kay and Carol drive Vin to join his squadron. On their journey home, they witness fighter planes in a dogfight. For safety, Kay stops the car, and they see a German plane crash. Kay realizes Carol has been wounded by machine gun fire from the plane, and takes her back to Starlings. She dies a few minutes after they reach home. Kay is devastated. When Vin returns from battle, he already knows the terrible news: Ironically, he is the survivor, and she the one who died.\

The bridge must be blown up to prevent enemy troops from traveling across it to respond to an upcoming offensive against the fascists.\
Jordan meets an old man, Anselmo, who is a guerrilla fighter who will serve as Jordan's liaison with the local guerrilla fighters. Anselmo leads Jordan to a group of Republican guerrillas who are led by a middle-aged man named Pablo. Jordan falls in love one of the guerrillas, a young woman named Mar\'eda. Mar\'eda's life was shattered by her parents' execution and her gang-rape at the hands of the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Falangism"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Falangists}}\'a0(part of the fascist coalition) at the outbreak of the war. Jordan has a strong sense of duty, which clashes with the unwillingness of the guerrilla leader Pablo to commit to helping with the bridge-blowing operation, as it would endanger himself and his band. At the same time, Jordan develops a new-found lust for life which arises from his love for Mar\'eda. Pablo's wife Pilar displaces Pablo as the group leader and pledges the allegiance of the guerrillas to Jordan's mission. However, when another band of anti-fascist guerrillas, led by El Sordo, is surrounded and killed in a desperate\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Last_stand"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 last stand}}, Pablo destroys Jordan's dynamite detonation equipment, hoping to prevent the bridge demolition and thereby avoid fascist reprisals on his camp. Later, Pablo regrets abandoning his comrades and returns to assist in the operation.\
However, the enemy, apprised of the coming offensive, has prepared to ambush the Republicans in force and it seems unlikely that blowing up the bridge will do much to prevent a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Rout"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 rout}}. Regardless, Jordan understands that he must still demolish the bridge in an attempt to prevent fascist reinforcements from overwhelming his allies. Lacking the equipment destroyed by Pablo, Jordan and Anselmo improvise an alternative method to explode the dynamite by using\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Hand_grenade"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 hand grenades}}. Jordan attaches wires to the grenades so that their pins can be pulled from a distance. This improvised plan is considerably more dangerous than using conventional detonators, because the men must increase their proximity to the explosion.\
While the guerrilla fighters\'97Pablo, Pilar, and Mar\'eda\'97create a diversion for Jordan and Anselmo, the two men plant and detonate the dynamite, costing Anselmo his life when he is hit by a piece of debris from the exploding bridge. While the guerrillas are escaping on horseback, Jordan is maimed when a fascist tank shoots his horse out from under him. Jordan cannot feel his legs and he knows that if his comrades stop to rescue him, they too will be captured or killed. He bids goodbye to Mar\'eda and ensures that she escapes to safety with the surviving guerrillas.

In the trenches of France, several of the soldiers in the production are killed or wounded by shrapnel from a German artillery barrage. Jones is wounded in the leg and must walk with a cane, ending his career as a dancer. Nevertheless, he is resolved to find something useful to do, especially now that he is the father of a son. Sgt.

Twenty-five years later World War II is raging in Europe.

Johnny reluctantly accepts an order to stage another musical, following in his father's footsteps.

Father Charles \'93Chuck\'94 O\'92Malley, an incoming priest from\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/East_St._Louis"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 East St. Louis}}, arrives in\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/New_York_City"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 New York City}}\'a0with an unconventional style that will transform the parish life of St. Dominic\'92s Church.\
On his first day, O'Malley gets into a series of mishaps; his informal appearance and attitude make a poor impression with the elder pastor, Father Fitzgibbon. The very traditional Fitzgibbon is further put off by O\'92Malley\'92s recreational habits\'a0\'96 particularly his golf-playing\'a0\'96 and his friendship with the even more casual Father Timmy O\'92Dowd. In a discussion between O'Malley and O'Dowd without Fitzgibbon present, it is revealed that O\'92Malley was sent by the bishop to take charge of the affairs of the parish, but that Fitzgibbon is to remain as pastor. To spare Fitzgibbon\'92s feelings, the older pastor is kept unaware of this arrangement and believes that O\'92Malley is simply his assistant.\
A series of events highlights the difference between O\'92Malley and Fitzgibbon\'92s styles, as they deal with events like a parishioner being evicted and a young woman named Carol James having run away from home. The most consequential difference of opinion between O\'92Malley and Fitzgibbon arises in their handling of the youth of the church, many of whom are consistently getting into trouble with the law in a gang led by Tony Scaponi. Fitzgibbon is inclined to look the other way, siding with the boys because of their frequent church attendance. O\'92Malley seeks to make inroads into the boys\'92 lives, befriending Scaponi and eventually convincing the boys to become a church choir.\
The noise of the practicing choir annoys Fitzgibbon, who finally decides to go to the bishop and ask for O\'92Malley to be transferred away. In the course of the conversation, Fitzgibbon infers the bishop\'92s intention to put O\'92Malley in charge of the parish. To avoid an uncomfortable situation, instead of making his initial request, Fitzgibbon asks the bishop to put O\'92Malley in charge, and then, resigned to his fate of losing control over the church, he informs O\'92Malley of his new role.\
A distressed Fitzgibbon then runs away, leading to a search. He returns late at night, and as O\'92Malley puts the older priest to bed, the two begin to bond. They discuss Fitzgibbon\'92s long-put-off desire to go to\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Ireland"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Ireland}}\'a0and see his mother, whom he has not seen since he left Ireland as a young priest to come to America, and who is now over 90. O\'92Malley puts Fitzgibbon to sleep with an Irish lullaby, \'93{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Too_Ra_Loo_Ra_Loo_Ral"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Too Ra Loo Ra Loo Ral}}\'94.\
O'Malley runs into Jenny Tuffel, an old girlfriend whom he left to join the priesthood. Jenny now has a successful career with the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Metropolitan_Opera"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Metropolitan Opera}}, performing under the stage name Genevieve Linden. As she prepares to go onstage as the lead in a performance of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Carmen"}}{\fldrslt 
\f1\i \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Carmen}}, the two discuss their past, and she learns that her world travels with a previous opera company caused her to miss his letter explaining he had entered the priesthood.\
O'Malley next pays a visit to Carol, who is now suspected of living in sin with Ted Haines Jr., the son of the church's mortgage-holder, Ted Haines Sr. On this visit, O\'92Malley describes to the young couple his calling in life to \'93go his way,\'94 which to him means to follow after the joyous side of religion and lead others to do the same. He performs for them the song \'93Going My Way,\'94 which he wrote on this theme.\
Jenny visits O\'92Malley at the church, sees the boys\'92 choir, and reads the sheet music of \'93Going My Way.\'94 She, O'Malley, and Father O\'92Dowd devise a plan to rent out the Metropolitan, perform \'93Going My Way\'94 with the choir and a full orchestra, then sell the rights to the song, thereby saving the church from its financial woes. The plan fails, as the music executive brought on to hear the song does not believe it will sell. The choir decides to make the most of its opportunity on the grand stage, and sings another song, "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Swinging_on_a_Star"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Swinging on a Star}}". The executive overhears the song and decides to buy it, providing enough money to pay off the church mortgage.\
With the church affairs in order, O\'92Malley and Fitzgibbon go on a golf course together. Just as everything seems to have fallen into place, though, the parish church is damaged in a massive fire. O'Malley prepares to move on to a new assignment from the bishop. He leaves O\'92Dowd to be Fitzgibbon\'92s new assistant, putting Tony Scaponi in charge of the choir. On Christmas Eve, parishioners gather in a temporary church for a service that also serves as O'Malley's farewell. As a going-away present, O\'92Malley has sent for Fitzgibbon\'92s mother from Ireland. As mother and son embrace for the first time in 45 years, the choir sings \'93Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ral\'94, as Father O\'92Malley quietly slips away into the night.\

The girl later learns from her father Dan Blake (George Eldredge) that the pilot has died in a crash. She tears up a letter she had been writing to him, and lowers her head as the film fades into intermission.\
The film resumes at the point when the girl discovers that her clothes no longer fit, sending her into a state of despair. She takes advice from her teacher, Carl Blackburn (Hardie Albright), who had previously been fired for teaching sex education. Blackburn blames her mother for the problem, and accuses her of "neglect[ing] the sacred duty of telling their children the real truth." Only then is the girl able to confront her mother.

All three have trouble adjusting to civilian life.\
Al is a banker with a comfortable home and a loving family: wife Milly, adult daughter Peggy, and high school student son Rob. He is promoted to Vice President in charge of small loans, as the president views his military experience as valuable in dealing with other returning servicemen. When Al approves an unsecured loan to a young Navy veteran, the president advises him against making a habit of it. Later, at a banquet in his honor, a slightly inebriated Al expounds that the bank (and America) must stand with the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Veterans"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 vets}}\'a0and give them every chance to rebuild their lives.\
Fred, once an unskilled drugstore\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Soda_jerk"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 soda jerk}}, wants something better, but the tight postwar job market forces him to return to his old job. Fred had met Marie while in flight training and married her shortly afterward, before shipping out less than a month later. She became a nightclub waitress while Fred was overseas. Marie makes it clear she does not enjoy being married to a lowly soda jerk.\
Homer was a high school football quarterback and became engaged to his next door neighbor, Wilma, before joining the Navy. Homer and his parents now have trouble dealing with his disability. He does not want to burden Wilma with his handicap so he eventually pushes her away, although she still wants to marry him.\
Peggy meets Fred when picking up her father home from a bar where the three men had reunited. They are attracted to each other. Peggy dislikes Marie, and informs her parents she intends to end Fred's marriage, but they tell her that their own marriage overcame similar problems. Concerned, Al demands that Fred stop seeing his daughter. Fred agrees, but the friendship between the two men is strained.\
When an obnoxious customer, who claims that the war was fought against the wrong enemies, gets into a fight with Homer, Fred intervenes and knocks the man down \'96 costing him his job. Fred encourages Homer to put his misgivings behind him and marry Wilma, offering to be his best man.\
Wilma visits Homer and tells him that her parents want her to leave Boone City for an extended period to try to forget him. Homer bluntly demonstrates to her how hard life with him would be. When Wilma is undaunted, Homer reconsiders.\
Fred discovers his wife with another veteran. After complaining to Fred that she has "given up the best years of my life," Marie tells him that she is getting a divorce. Fred decides to leave town, and gives his father his medals and citations, including his\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Distinguished_Flying_Cross_(United_States)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Distinguished Flying Cross}}, with a citation signed by\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Jimmy_Doolittle"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 General Doolittle}}.

The boss of a work crew rouses him from his flashback. Fred persuades the man to hire him.\
People have gathered for the wedding of Homer and Wilma. Fred, now divorced, is Homer's best man. While the vows are exchanged, Fred and Peggy glance across at one another. At the conclusion everyone gathers around the newlyweds. Still gazing over at Peggy, Fred walks across the room, takes her in his arms and kisses her. He asks if she understands how things will be for them, that it could take years before they can get a life established. All the while Peggy smiles fondly at Fred, and then kisses him again.\

Before Scott Chavez is executed as a punishment for killing his wife, he arranges for his daughter Pearl to live with his second cousin and old sweetheart, Laura Belle ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Lillian_Gish"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Lillian Gish}}).\
Arriving by stagecoach, Pearl is met by Jesse McCanles ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Joseph_Cotten"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Joseph Cotten}}), one of Laura Belle's two grown sons. He takes her to Spanish Bit, their enormous cattle ranch. The gentle and gracious Laura Belle is happy to welcome her to their home, but not so her husband, the Senator Jackson McCanles ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Lionel_Barrymore"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Lionel Barrymore}}), who uses a wheelchair. He calls Pearl "a half-breed" and jealously despises Pearl's father.\
The second son, Lewt ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Gregory_Peck"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Gregory Peck}}), is a ladies' man with a personality quite unlike that of his gentlemanly brother Jesse. He expresses his interest in Pearl in direct terms and she takes a strong dislike to him. Laura Belle calls in Mr. Jubal Crabbe, the "Sinkiller" ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Walter_Huston"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Walter Huston}}), a gun-toting preacher, to counsel Pearl on how to avoid the evils of temptation. Pearl is determined to remain "a good girl."\
When she submits to Lewt's aggressive advances one night, Pearl is angry with him and ashamed of her own behavior. But she also cannot help but be flattered by his lust and attentions. Jesse, meanwhile, is ostracized by his father and no longer welcome at the ranch after siding with railroad men, headed by Mr. Langford ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Otto_Kruger"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Otto Kruger}}), against the Senator's personal interests. Jesse is in love with Pearl but he leaves for\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Austin"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Austin}}\'a0to pursue a political career and becomes engaged to Helen Langford ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Joan_Tetzel"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Joan Tetzel}}), Langford's daughter.\
Offended when Lewt reneges on a promise to marry her, Pearl takes up with Sam Pierce ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Charles_Bickford"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Charles Bickford}}), a neighboring rancher who is smitten with her. She does not love him but says yes to his proposal. Before they can be married, however, Lewt picks a fight with Pierce in a saloon and guns him down. He insists that Pearl can belong only to him. Lewt becomes a wanted man.\
On the run from the law, Lewt finds time to derail a train and occasionally drop by the ranch late at night and press his attentions on Pearl. She cannot resist her desire for him and lies for Lewt to the law, hiding him in her room. Afterward, however, he walks out on her, despite her pleas that she loves him.\
Laura Belle's health takes a turn for the worse and the Senator admits his love for her before she dies. Jesse returns to visit but is too late; his mother is dead. The Senator continues to shun him, as does Lewt, their family feud finally resulting in a showdown. Lewt tosses a gun to his unarmed brother but Jesse stands his ground without attempting to pick it up. Jesse warns that Lewt will eventually be hanged as a murderer, and Lewt responds by shooting Jesse.\
The Senator's old friend, Lem Smoot ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Harry_Carey_(actor)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Harry Carey}}) tells him that Jesse's wound is not mortal and the old man softens up towards his son.

However the small rural towns and villages remain strictly puritanical.\
Sixteen years after being abandoned in a small rural village, we see that Amber ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Linda_Darnell"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Linda Darnell}}) has grown into a beauty and is about to be married despite her protests. She wants to be more than a farmer's wife and dreams of court fashions and a life away from the village. Her dream comes true with the arrival of a group of cavaliers and the handsome Bruce Carlton ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Cornel_Wilde"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Cornel Wilde}}), with whom she becomes instantly smitten. She follows the Cavaliers to a tavern and begs Bruce to let her come with him to London. Despite her request and coaxing from Bruce's friend Almsbury ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Richard_Greene"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Richard Greene}}), Bruce refuses her, while Almsbury also unsuccessfully tries to seduce her. Amber once again tries to convince Bruce to take her to London, which he refuses, before they share a kiss.\
Bruce and Almsbury return to London to seek an audience with the king but are turned away.\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Barbara_Villiers"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Barbara Villiers}}, the king's mistress, is brought to court and coldly walks past them.\
As Bruce and Almsbury return to their London tavern, they see that Amber has followed them to London. Bruce allows her to stay with him and they begin an affair whereby Bruce pampers Amber with new gowns and takes her to the theater. At one performance, Bruce sees Barbara Villiers (Natalie Draper) alone and goes to speak with her about getting the king to grant him ships for his privateer mission. Amber is distraught at the thought of Bruce leaving and stops Almsbury from warning Bruce that the king has arrived. The king sees Bruce with his mistress and later summons him to court.\
Not wanting his friend to face the king's wrath alone, Almsbury goes with him. The king, however, grants Bruce the ships he needs and requests that he leave for Bristol that very night. Bruce and Almsbury return to the tavern to see Amber sleeping. Bruce plans on leaving before Amber wakes, and Almsbury helps him pack, despite telling Bruce that Amber loves him and it would be cruel.\
The next morning Amber wakes up to find Almsbury packing up his belongings and returning to Almsbury Hall. Almsbury explains that the king gave him back his lands and gave Bruce his ships as Amber races into Bruce's room to see it empty. Almsbury tries to convince Amber to go back to her village but she refuses, stating that she will marry Bruce no matter what. Almsbury leaves her and gives her money from Bruce to keep her from starving.\
However Amber is quickly conned out of her money, put in debt and sent to\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Newgate_Prison"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Newgate Prison}}. While in Newgate Prison, Amber discovers she's pregnant with Bruce's child and meets Black Jack Mallet, a highwayman, who falls in love with her and who helps her break out. The pair go to Mother Redcap's ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Anne_Revere"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Anne Revere}}) tavern where Amber gives birth to a son.\
Amber soon begins to make a living luring fops into alleyways where Black Jack robs them. During one of the robberies, Black Jack is killed by the king's guard and Amber flees. She hides inside a house where she is discovered by Captain Rex Morgan ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Glenn_Langan"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Glenn Langan}}).\

While Amber is working as an actress, the Earl of Radcliffe shows an interest in Amber, and Almsbury returns to London. He is now married with a child and tells Amber that Bruce will return any day now. Captain Morgan also proposes to Amber but she rejects him because she still loves Bruce. She also turns down a chance to dine with Charles II because of Bruce.\
Bruce returns and Amber introduces him to their son, hoping he will want to settle down. However he wants to return to sea. Morgan finds Bruce and Amber together and challenges Bruce to a duel, saying Amber is his fiance. Bruce accepts though he tries to persuade Morgan to end the duel. Morgan refuses and Bruce winds up killing him. He blames Amber and rejects her, and leaves England.\
Amber decides to marry the elderly widowed Earl of Radcliffe. This will make her a countess, which she hopes will interest Bruce.\
She discovered that Bruce's ship has docked in London and he has fallen victim to the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Black_Plague"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Black Plague}}. She saves his life by killing a nurse and lancing a boil on his chest. Bruce recovers and after discovering Amber is married to Radcliffe, leaves Amber for Virginia.\
A great fire hits London. Charles II attempts to seduce Amber, but Radcliffe takes her home and locks her up in her room. The fire reaches their house, Amber fights with Radcliffe. A servant hits Radcliff and throws him into the fire, killing him. Amber becomes Charles' mistress.\
Bruce visits from Virginia with his new wife Corinna, wanting to take their son to America. Amber invites Corinna to dine with her and Charles II, hoping Charles will seduce her. Charles figures this out and allows Corinna to leave. Charles then ends his relationship with Amber, realising that she still loves Bruce.\
Bruce asks again for custody of his son. Amber asks the son to decide, expecting him to want to stay with his mother. However the son is keen to go to Virginia. Bruce offers Amber the chance to come with them but she decides to stay. Amber watches heartbroken as Bruce takes her son away.\

She reveals that she and Don are no longer a team and makes it obvious that she is attracted to Johnny. She continues to pursue him, but he refuses her out of respect for Don.\
Don drowns his sorrow at a bar, where he brags that he can make a star of the next dancer he meets. He picks one of the girls performing on stage, Hannah Brown ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Judy_Garland"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Judy Garland}}), and tells her to meet him for rehearsal the next day. He tries to turn her into a copy of Nadine, teaching her to dance the same way, buying her dresses in a similar style and giving her an "exotic" stage name, "Juanita". However, she makes several mistakes at their first performance ("Beautiful Faces Need Beautiful Clothes"), and the show is a fiasco.\
Hannah meets Johnny, who is instantly attracted to her and sings "A Fella With an Umbrella" while walking her to her rehearsal with Don. After he tries - unsuccessfully - to reunite Nadine and Don by inviting them to lunch and then leaving them alone, she tells him her friends are laughing because Hannah is trying to be her. He realizes his mistake and after hearing Hannah sing "I Love a Piano", he works out routines more suited to her personality. Now known as "Hannah & Hewes", they are shown much more successfully performing "I Love a Piano," "Snookie-Ookums", "The Ragtime Violin", and "When That Midnight Choo-Choo Leaves For Alabam'".\

Hannah realizes that Nadine was Don's former dancing partner and demands to know if they were in love. Later, Don meets Hannah back at the hotel and reveals that he turned down the Ziegfeld offer, believing that she and Nadine do not belong in the same show. Johnny arrives to take Hannah to dinner, at which he reveals that he has fallen in love with her. While she does like him, she admits she is actually in love with Don. They continue to have a close friendship.\
Nadine's show opens ("Shakin' The Blues Away") and Don is in the audience. When he and Hannah meet the next day, he reveals he signed them to star in their own show and invites her to celebrate over dinner. She arrives at his apartment, only to have him suggest a dance rehearsal. She is upset and tells him that he doesn't see her as a woman, only a dancing aid. She tries to leave, but he stops and kisses her. She then plays the piano and sings "It Only Happens When I Dance With You," after which he realizes he is in love with her and they embrace.\
The show contains a solo by Don ("{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Steppin%27_Out_with_My_Baby"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Steppin' Out with My Baby}}"), followed by the best-known musical number in the film ("{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/We%27re_a_Couple_of_Swells"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 We're a Couple of Swells}}"), in which he and Hannah play a pair of street urchins with vivid imaginations. They go to celebrate after the show at the roof garden where Nadine is performing. The audience gives them a rousing ovation as they arrive, much to Nadine's chagrin who hears the uproar backstage. After she dances in a number called "The Girl on the Magazine Cover," she insists that Don perform one of their old numbers with her for old times' sake - "It Only Happens When I Dance With You (Reprise)". When he reluctantly agrees, Hannah becomes upset and leaves, believing that he has only been using her to regain Nadine, and has succeeded.\
Hannah goes to the bar where she and Don first met. She pours out her troubles to Mike the bartender ("Better Luck Next Time"). When she returns to her apartment, she finds Don waiting. He tries to explain that he was forced to dance with Nadine and says he'll wait all night for her to forgive him, but just before she opens the door, he is evicted by the house detective. The next morning Hannah tells Johnny about her and Don's misunderstanding. He says if he loved someone he would let her know it.

Later that morning, several gifts arrive at Don's apartment, with no cards.

\f1\i Heart of Fire
\f0\i0 \'a0progresses, Julian recognises the music as one of his own compositions.\
During the performance, Professor Palmer receives an invitation to an after-ballet party at Lady Neston's residence, also asking Boris Lermontov, the company impresario, to attend. Julian leaves the performance in disillusionment at his professor's plagiarism of his music. Lermontov and Vicki meet, and he invites her to a rehearsal of the company.\
Julian has written to Lermontov to explain the circumstances behind\'a0
\f1\i Heart of Fire
\f0\i0 , but then tries to retrieve the letter. Lermontov's assistant Dimitri thwarts all attempts by Julian to gain entry to Lermontov's suite, but finally Lermontov gives Julian an audience. Julian says that he wishes to retrieve his letter before Lermontov has seen it, except that Lermontov has already read the letter.\
Lermontov asks Julian to play one of his own works at the piano.

He decides to create a starring role for her in a new ballet,\'a0
\f1\i The Red Shoes
\f0\i0 , for which Julian is to provide the music.\

\f1\i The Red Shoes
\f0\i0 \'a0ballet is a resounding success and Lermontov revitalizes the company's repertoire with Vicky in the lead roles and Julian tasked with composing new scores. In the meantime, Vicky and Julian have fallen in love, but keep their relationship secret from Lermontov. Lermontov begins to have personal feelings toward Vicky; he resents the romance between her and Julian after learning of it. The impresario fires Julian; Vicky leaves the company with him. They marry and live in London, where Julian works on composing a new opera.\
Some time later whilst travelling, Vicky receives a visit from Lermontov, who convinces her to return to the company to dance a revival of\'a0
\f1\i The Red Shoes
\f0\i0 . On opening night, Julian appears in her dressing room; he has left the premi\'e8re of his opera at\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Royal_Opera_House"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Covent Garden}}\'a0to find her and take her back. Lermontov arrives; he and Julian contend for Vicky's affections, each one arguing that her true destiny is with him only. Torn between her love for Julian and her need to dance, she eventually chooses the latter.\
Julian, realising that he has lost her, leaves for the railway station; Lermontov consoles Vicky and tries to turn her attention to the evening's performance. Vicky is escorted to the stage wearing the red shoes and, seemingly under their influence, turns and runs from the theatre. Julian, on the platform of the railway station, runs towards her. Vicky jumps from a balcony and falls in front of an approaching train.\
When Vicki jumps, she is wearing the red shoes which we saw her wearing as she is preparing in her dressing room, despite the fact that in the performance her character does not put them on until part way through the ballet. Powell and Pressburger themselves discussed this situation\'a0

Dr. Kik (Leo Genn; as Mark Van\'a0

He worked for a publisher who rejected her writing, and they bumped into each other again in the cafeteria. Occasionally she continued to drop by the cafeteria so they get to know each other.\
Despite their blossoming romance, Virginia abruptly leaves town without explanation. Robert moves to New York and bumps into her again at the Philharmonic. After she provides a flimsy excuse for her absence and departure, they pick up where they left off, though she remains evasive and avoids his desire for marriage. Eventually, Virginia brings up the possibility of marriage. They marry on May 7, but Virginia acts erratically again. She can\'92t sleep and loses touch with reality, as she feels it is November and snaps when Robert corrects her. The rest of the film follows her therapy.

Dr. Kik wants to get to the "causes of her unconscious rejection." The film includes many flashbacks, including her earlier failed engagement to Gordon ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Leif_Erickson_(actor)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Leif Erickson}}) as well as childhood issues. The film shows her progress and what happens to her along the way.\
The mental hospital is organized on a spectrum of "levels." The better a patient gets, the lower level she is able to achieve. Virginia moves to the lowest level (One), where she encounters Nurse Davis (Helen Craig), the only truly abusive nurse in the hospital. Davis is jealous of Dr. Kik's interest in Virginia, which she sees as excessive. Nurse Davis goads Virginia into an outburst which results in Virginia being\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Straitjacket"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 straitjacketed}}\'a0and expelled from Level One into the "snake pit," where patients considered beyond help are simply placed together in a large padded cell and abandoned. Dr. Kik, learning of this, has Virginia returned to Level One, but away from Nurse Davis's care.\
Despite this setback, Dr. Kik's care continues to improve Virginia's mental state. Over time, Virginia gains insight and self-understanding, and is able to leave the hospital.\
The film also depicts the bureaucratic regimentation of the institution, the staff \'97 some unkind and aloof, some kind and empathetic; and relationships between patients, from which Virginia learns as much as she does in therapy.\

After paying his debt, Samson searches for Semadar, only to learn that her father Tubal married her to a Philistine once Samson left the wedding to pay his debt. A fight breaks out between Samson and the Philistines, which results in the death of Semadar and Tubal. Samson becomes a hunted man, and in his fury he begins fighting the Philistines. The Saran of Gaza imposes heavy taxes on the Danites, with the purpose of having Samson betrayed by his own people. The Saran's plan works, and frustrated Danites hand over Samson to the Philistines, much to the joy of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Delilah"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Delilah}}, Semadar's younger sister. Samson is taken by Prince Ahtur, the military governor of the land of Dan, and a regiment of Philistine troops. En route back to Gaza, Ahtur decides to taunt Samson. Samson rips apart his chains and ropes and begins to combat the Philistines, toppling Ahtur's war chariot and using the jawbone of an ass to club the Philistine soldiers to death.\
News of the defeat of Ahtur at the hands of Samson reaches the Saran. The Saran ponders how to defeat Samson. Delilah comes up with the idea of seducing Samson, thus having him reveal the secret of his strength and then deliver him for punishment. Her plan works; she cuts his hair, which he feels gives him his strength. To fully neutralize him, Samson is blinded by his captors and put to slave work, and is eventually brought to the temple of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Dagon"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Dagon}}\'a0for the entertainment of the Philistines and the Saran. However, Delilah has been in love with Samson ever since his engagement with Semadar, and his blindness and torture make her feel deep remorse over her betrayal. She initially had betrayed him because she wanted to avenge the deaths of her father and sister, which she thought were caused "because of Samson."\
Delilah later attends the public torture of Samson wielding a whip which he uses to be guided by her to the temple of Dagon's main support pillars. Once he stands between them, he tells Delilah to flee, but she remains, unseen by him, as he pushes the pillars apart. The pillars give way and the temple collapses, burying Samson, Delilah, and all the Philistines inside alive, including the court. In the end, the temple lies in rubble, and Saul and Miriam, his two closest Danite Hebrew friends, are left to mourn Samson's passing.\

In spite of this, Cinderella is a kind and gentle young woman. She is friends with mice and kind to birds that live in and around the ch\'e2teau. Meanwhile, at the royal palace, the King is frustrated that his son, the Prince, still refuses to marry. He and the Grand Duke organize a ball in an effort to find a suitable wife for the Prince, requesting every eligible maiden attend. Upon receiving notice of the ball, Lady Tremaine agrees to let Cinderella go if she finishes her chores and can find a suitable dress to wear.\
Cinderella finds a gown that belonged to her mother and decides to refashion it for the ball, but her stepfamily impedes this by giving her extra chores. Cinderella's animal friends, including\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Jaq_and_Gus"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Jaq and Gus}}, refashion it for her, completing the design with a necklace and sash discarded by Drizella and Anastasia, respectively.

Heartbroken, Cinderella storms out into the garden in tears, where her\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Fairy_Godmother_(Disney)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Fairy Godmother}}\'a0appears before her. Insisting that Cinderella will go to the ball, the Fairy Godmother magically transforms a pumpkin into a carriage, the mice into horses, Cinderella's horse, Major, into a coachman, and dog, Bruno, into a footman, before turning Cinderella's ruined dress into a shimmering blue ballgown and her shoes into glass slippers. As Cinderella leaves for the ball, the Fairy Godmother warns her the spell will break at the stroke of midnight.\
At the ball, the Prince rejects every girl until he sees Cinderella, who agrees to dance with him, unaware of who he is. The two fall in love and go out for a stroll together in the castle gardens. As they are about to kiss, Cinderella hears the clock start to chime midnight and flees. As she leaves the castle, one of her slippers falls off. The palace guards give chase as Cinderella flees in the coach before the spell breaks on the last stroke of midnight. Cinderella, her pets, and the mice hide in a wooded area as the guards pass.\
The Grand Duke informs the King that Cinderella, who remains anonymous, has escaped, and that the Prince wishes to marry her. The lost glass slipper is the only piece of evidence. The King issues a royal proclamation ordering every maiden in the kingdom to try on the slipper for size in an effort to find the girl. After this news reaches Cinderella's household, Lady Tremaine overhears Cinderella humming the waltz played at the ball. Realizing that Cinderella is the mysterious girl, Lady Tremaine locks her in her attic bedroom. Later, the Duke arrives at the ch\'e2teau, and Jaq and Gus steal the key from Lady Tremaine's dress pocket and take it up to the attic as Anastasia and Drizella unsuccessfully try on the slipper. Lady Tremaine's cat, Lucifer, ambushes the mice, but Bruno chases him out of the house, allowing the mice to free Cinderella. As the Duke is about to leave, Cinderella appears and asks to try on the slipper. Knowing it will fit, Lady Tremaine trips the footman as he brings the Duke the slipper, causing it to shatter on the floor. Much to her horror, Cinderella presents the Duke with the other slipper, which fits perfectly. The film ends with a now-married Prince and Cinderella at their wedding, sharing a kiss as they leave.\

They discover that their companion is royalty; he has returned to attempt to dethrone the evil King Twala (Baziga). Umbopa leaves with his supporters, while Allan, Elizabeth and John travel to a tense meeting with Twala. With his last rifle bullet, John kills a would-be attacker, temporarily quelling the natives.\
The king's advisor, Gagool (Sekaryongo), communicates that they have seen Curtis and leads them to a cave that contains a trove of jewels and in which they find the skeletal remains of Elizabeth's husband. While they are distracted by this discovery, Gagool sneaks away and triggers a booby trap that seals them inside the cave. Leaving the jewels behind, they find a way out through an underground stream and return to the settlement, just as Umbopa and his followers arrive.\
Umbopa's people have an unusual method of deciding the kingship. The two claimants duel to the death. Despite cheating by one of Twala's men, Umbopa wins. Afterwards, he provides an escort for his friends' return trip.\

At that time, Marcellus was told by Paulus that Caligula had become the emperor.\
Marcellus Gallio, son of an important Roman senator ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Torin_Thatcher"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Torin Thatcher}}), and himself a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Military_tribune"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 military tribune}}, introduces through flashback narration, the might and scope of the Roman empire. Marcellus is notoriously known as a ladies\'92 man, but is captivated by the reappearance of his childhood sweetheart, Diana, ward of the Emperor Tiberius. Diana is unofficially pledged in marriage to Tiberius's regent, Caligula.\
In a slave market Marcellus bids against Caligula for a defiant Greek slave, Demetrius ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Victor_Mature"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Victor Mature}}), and wins. Angrily, Caligula issues orders for Marcellus to receive a military transfer to\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Jerusalem"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Jerusalem}}\'a0in\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Palestine_(region)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Palestine}}.\
Marcellus has Demetrius released and orders him to go on his own to the Gallio home. Marcellus is surprised to find Demetrius waiting for him when he arrives. Unofficially, Marcellus had freed Demetrius, but Demetrius feels honor bound to compensate Marcellus by being his servant. Demetrius accompanies Marcellus to Palestine but, before the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Galley"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 galley}}\'a0sails, Diana comes to see Marcellus, pledging her love for him and her intention to intercede on his behalf with Tiberius. Marcellus declares his love for Diana and asks her to make the emperor promise not to give her in marriage to Caligula.\
Marcellus rides into Jerusalem with the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Centurion"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 centurion}}\'a0Paulus ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Jeff_Morrow"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Jeff Morrow}}) on the same day as Jesus's triumphal entry on\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Palm_Sunday"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Palm Sunday}}.

Marcellus reports to Pilate, who informs him that the emperor has sent for him. Before Marcellus departs, he is ordered to take charge of the detail of Roman soldiers assigned to crucify Jesus. Marcellus wins the robe worn by Jesus in a dice game and is told it will be a reminder of Marcellus's first crucifixion.\
Returning from the crucifixion with Demetrius, Marcellus uses the robe in an attempt to shield himself from a rain squall, but feels a sudden crushing guilt for crucifying Jesus and tears the robe off. In a fit of rage, Demetrius curses Marcellus and the Roman Empire and runs away, taking the robe with him. Marcellus now behaves like a madman haunted by nightmares of the crucifixion. He reports to Emperor Tiberius at\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Capri"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Capri}}, who gives him an imperial commission to find and destroy the robe, while gathering a list of names of Jesus' followers. At Diana's request, Tiberius leaves her free to marry Marcellus, though Tiberius believes Marcellus is mad.\
Marcellus travels to Palestine, seeking to ingratiate himself with Justus ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Dean_Jagger"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Dean Jagger}}), a weaver in Cana, and the Christian community that he leads. He sees examples of Christian life in Justus's miraculously healed grandson and in the paralytic Miriam.\
Marcellus finds Demetrius alone in an inn and demands that he destroy the robe, believing it has cursed him into madness. Demetrius tells him the robe has no real power, that it only reminds Marcellus of what he did, and it is his guilt over the killing of an innocent man that has caused him to become so troubled.\
Demetrius gives the robe to Marcellus, who refuses to touch it. He is terrified, but as the robe touches him, he is relieved from the burden and becomes a Christian.\
Justus calls the villagers together and begins to introduce\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Simon_Peter"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Peter}}, when he is killed by an arrow from a detachment of Roman soldiers. Marcellus intervenes and Paulus informs him that his orders are no longer valid; Tiberius is dead, and Caligula is emperor. Marcellus informs Paulus that an imperial commission is valid until specifically countermanded by the new emperor. Paulus tells Marcellus to make him obey via a sword duel. After a prolonged struggle, Marcellus prevails. Rather than killing Paulus, Marcellus hurls his sword into a tree. Paulus, humiliated by his defeat, orders the soldiers to leave.\
Peter invites Marcellus to join Demetrius and him as missionaries. Marcellus hesitates, out of guilt; but when Peter tells him of his own denial of Jesus, Marcellus confesses his role in Jesus' death. Peter points out to him that Jesus forgave him from the cross, and Marcellus pledges his life to Jesus and agrees to go with them. Their missionary journey takes them to Rome, where they must proceed "under cover" as Caligula has proscribed them.\
From Rome, Caligula summons Diana from her retreat at the Gallio home, to tell her that Marcellus has become a traitor to Rome by becoming a Christian. He takes her to the guard room where a captured Demetrius is being tortured. Diana runs out of the palace to Marcipor ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/w/index.php?title=David_Leonard_(actor)&action=edit&redlink=1"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 David Leonard}}), the Gallio family slave, who is secretly Christian. Diana guesses that he is a Christian and has seen Marcellus, and so she gets Marcipor to take her to see him.\
Marcellus and Diana are reunited, and Marcellus tells her the story of the robe and his Christian conversion. Diana helps Marcellus rescue Demetrius.\
Peter comes to Gallio, where Demetrius has been taken, and heals him. Caligula issues orders to bring Marcellus to him alive to stand trial by the end of the day.\
After witnessing Peter's healing of Demetrius, the physician attending Demetrius goes to denounce them to the authorities. Marcellus' father disowns him as an enemy of Rome. Marcellus flees with Demetrius, but when Marcellus gives himself up so that Demetrius can escape, he is captured and put on trial.\
Caligula makes Diana sit next to him for Marcellus's trial. Marcellus admits to being a Christian; however, he denies the charge that Christians are plotting against the state. Marcellus tries to show Caligula his opportunity to accept Christ as he tries to hand the robe to Caligula, but Caligula refuses to touch it, as he considers it to be "bewitched".\
Caligula condemns Marcellus to death by the wish of the members of the audience, based on what they have heard. Diana then accepts Christ and seeks to join Marcellus, the man she considers to be her husband, in\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Heaven"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 His Kingdom}}\'a0(Heaven). She also denounces Caligula as an insane, tyrannical monster.\
Caligula condemns Diana to die alongside Marcellus. As they depart the audience hall for their execution, Marcellus is acknowledged by his repentant father, and Diana gives the robe to Marcipor.\
Recuperating from a broken leg, adventuresome professional photographer L. B. "Jeff" Jefferies (Stewart) is confined to a wheelchair in his\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Greenwich_Village"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Greenwich Village}}\'a0apartment. His rear window looks out onto a courtyard and several other apartments. During a powerful\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Heat_wave"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 heat wave}}, he watches his neighbors, who keep their windows open to stay cool.\
He observes a flamboyant dancer he nicknames "Miss Torso"; a single middle-aged woman he calls "Miss Lonelyhearts"; a talented, single, middle-aged composer-pianist; several married couples; a female sculptor; and Lars Thorwald (Burr), a traveling jewelry salesman with a bedridden wife.\
Jeff's sophisticated, beautiful\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Socialite"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 socialite}}\'a0girlfriend, Lisa Fremont (Grace Kelly), visits him regularly, as does his insurance company's nurse, Stella (Thelma Ritter). Stella wants Jeff to settle down and marry Lisa, but Jeff is reluctant.\
One night during a thunderstorm, Jeff hears a woman scream "Don't!" and then the sound of breaking glass. Later, he is awakened by thunder and observes Thorwald leaving his apartment. Thorwald makes repeated late-night trips carrying his sample case. The next morning, Jeff notices that Thorwald's wife is gone, and then sees Thorwald cleaning a large knife and handsaw. Later, Thorwald ties a large trunk with heavy rope and has moving men haul it away. Jeff discusses all this with Lisa and with Stella.\
Jeff becomes convinced that Thorwald has murdered his wife. Jeff explains this to his friend Tom Doyle ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Wendell_Corey"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Wendell Corey}}), a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/New_York_City_Police_Department"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 New York City Police}}\'a0detective, and asks him to do some research. Doyle finds nothing suspicious; apparently, Mrs. Thorwald is upstate, and picked up the trunk herself.\
Soon after, a neighbor's dog is found dead with its neck broken. The dog's owner yells across the courtyard, complaining of her neighbors' callous disregard of others. All the neighbors run to their windows to see what is happening, except for Thorwald, whose cigar can be seen glowing as he sits quietly in his dark apartment.\
Certain that Thorwald is also guilty of killing the dog, Jeff asks Lisa to slip an accusatory note under his door, so Jeff can watch his reaction when he reads it. Then, as a pretext to get Thorwald out of his apartment, Jeff telephones him and arranges a meeting at a bar. He believes Thorwald buried something incriminating in the courtyard flower bed, and killed the dog to stop it digging there, so when Thorwald leaves, Lisa and Stella dig up the flowers; they find nothing.\
Much to Jeff's amazement and admiration, Lisa then climbs the fire escape to Thorwald's apartment and clambers in through an open window. When Thorwald returns and grabs Lisa, Jeff calls the police, who arrive in time to save her by arresting her. Jeff sees Lisa has her hands behind her back, wiggling her finger with Mrs. Thorwald's wedding ring on it. Thorwald notices this, and, realizing that she is signaling to someone, he sees Jeff across the courtyard.\
Jeff phones Doyle and leaves an urgent message. Stella heads for the police station to post bail for Lisa. When his phone rings, Jeff assumes it is Doyle, and says that the suspect has left the apartment. When no one answers, Jeff realizes that Thorwald himself had called, and is heading over to confront him. When Thorwald enters, Jeff repeatedly sets off his camera flashbulbs, temporarily blinding him. However, Thorwald grabs Jeff and manages to push him out of the open window, as Jeff is yelling for help. Police officers enter the apartment as he falls to the ground; other officers have run over to break his fall. Thorwald confesses to the police soon afterward.\
A few days later, the heat has lifted, and Jeff rests peacefully in his wheelchair, now with casts on both legs. The lonely neighbor is chatting with the pianist in his apartment, the dancer's lover returns home from the army, the couple whose dog was killed have a new dog, and the newly married couple are bickering.\
Lisa reclines on the daybed in Jeff's apartment, wearing jeans and apparently reading a book titled\'a0
\f1\i Beyond the High Himalayas
\f0\i0 . As soon as Jeff falls asleep, Lisa puts the book down and happily opens a fashion magazine.\

But, word has come down that their beloved commanding officer,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Major_General_(United_States)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Major General}}\'a0Thomas F.

He arrives for the end of the show and delivers an emotional farewell. The men give him a rousing send-off ("The Old Man").\
At the end of the performance, everyone is forced to take cover from an aerial bombing run. One bomb knocks over a partially-destroyed building, but Bob is too busy shouting orders to notice. Phil throws him out of the way and his arm is injured by debris. Bob later visits Phil at a field hospital and thanks the private for saving his life. When Bob offers a favor to repay the debt, Phil shows him a duet he wrote and asks to perform with Bob back in New York City. Feeling obligated by Phil's heroism, Bob agrees.\
After the war, Bob and Phil make it big in nightclubs, radio, and then on Broadway, eventually becoming successful producers ("Hi Hup", "Heat Wave", "Blue Skies"). They mount their newest hit musical titled\'a0
\f1\i Playing Around
\f0\i0 . The same day they receive a letter from "Freckle-Faced Haynes, the dog-faced boy," their mess sergeant from the war, asking them to look at an act that his two sisters are doing.\
When they go to the club to watch the act ("Sisters"), Phil notices that Bob is smitten with Betty ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Rosemary_Clooney"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Rosemary Clooney}}). Phil has eyes for her sister, Judy ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Vera-Ellen"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Vera-Ellen}}). Betty and Judy join Bob and Phil at their table, and Phil dances with Judy, so that Bob and Betty can get to know each other. Phil and Judy hit it off ("The Best Things Happen While You're Dancing"). Bob and Betty do not, getting into a minor argument about how Bob thinks that everyone has an angle in show business.\
Judy and Betty are headed for the Columbia Inn in Pine Tree, Vermont, where they are booked to perform over the holidays. Due to a disagreement with their landlord (he claimed that they had burned an expensive rug at his hotel and had even summoned the sheriff to arrest them), the girls have to leave immediately, so Phil gives the sisters his and Bob's sleeping-room accommodations aboard the train and delays the sheriff by imitating the girls' signature number ("Sisters" redux). Bob and Phil board later and Bob is extremely upset that they have to stay up all night in the club car on their way to NYC. They are joined by Betty and Judy, who thank them profusely for the tickets and convince them to come with them to Pine Tree ("Snow").\
When the train arrives in Pine Tree, there's not a snowflake in sight, and chances of it falling appear dim. Bob and Phil discover that the inn is run by their former commanding officer, General Waverly. Waverly has invested all of his savings into the lodge, which is in danger of failing because there's no snow and thus no guests. To bring business to the inn, Bob and Phil bring the entire cast and crew of their musical\'a0
\f1\i Playing Around
\f0\i0 , and add in Betty and Judy to the rehearsals ("Minstrel Number"). Bob and Betty's relationship blooms ("Count Your Blessings") and they spend a good deal of time together. Meanwhile, Bob discovers the General's request to rejoin the army has been rejected. He decides to prove to the General that he isn't forgotten.\
While rehearsals continue ("Choreography") Bob calls Ed Harrison ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Johnny_Grant_(radio_personality)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Johnny Grant}}), an old army buddy, now a successful variety show host, to arrange a televised invitation to all the men formerly under the command of the General to come to the inn on Christmas Eve as a surprise. In response, Harrison suggests they go all out and put the show on national television to generate free advertising for Wallace and Davis, but Bob insists that it will have nothing to do with their business. Unbeknownst to Bob, nosy housekeeper Emma Allen ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Mary_Wickes"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Mary Wickes}}) has been eavesdropping, but she has only heard the part about free advertising, not Bob's rejection of the idea.\
Mistakenly believing that her beloved boss will be portrayed as a pitiable figure in a nationwide broadcast, Emma reveals what she has heard to a shocked Betty. The misunderstanding causes Betty to grow suddenly cold towards a baffled Bob. While this is happening, Judy becomes convinced that Betty will never take on a serious relationship until Judy is engaged or married. She pressures a reluctant Phil to announce a phony engagement, but the plan backfires when Betty abruptly departs for New York City to take a job offer since Judy is taken care of.\
After rehearsals are complete ("Abraham Number"), Phil and Judy reveal to Bob that the engagement was phony. Bob, still unaware of the real reason behind Betty's coldness, goes to New York for\'a0
\f1\i The Ed Harrison Show
\f0\i0 , but decides to stop and try to convince Betty to come back. Bob sees Betty's new act ("Love, You Didn't Do Right by Me") and reveals the truth about the engagement, and Betty starts to warm up to him, but he is called away by Ed Harrison before learning what is really bothering her. Back at the Inn, Phil fakes an injury to distract the General so he won't see the broadcast of Bob's announcement.\
On the broadcast, Bob invites veterans of the 151st Division to come to Pine Tree, Vermont, on Christmas Eve ("What Can You Do with a General"). Betty catches Bob's televised pitch and realizes she was mistaken. She returns to Pine Tree in time for the Christmas Eve show, but only tells Judy. The whole division comes into Pine Tree secretly. When the General enters the lodge, he is greeted by his former division, who sing a rousing chorus of "The Old Man." Just as the following number ("Gee, I Wish I Was Back in the Army") ends, he learns that snow is finally falling.\
In the finale, Bob and Betty declare their love for one another, as do Phil and Judy. The background of the set is removed to show the snow falling, and Bob, Betty, Phil and Judy perform "white Christmas" while everyone raises a glass, and toasts, "May your days be merry and bright; and may all your Christmases be white."\
In 1868, rumors of a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Sea_monster"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 sea monster}}\'a0attacking ships in the Pacific Ocean have disrupted shipping lanes. The United States invites Professor Pierre M. Aronnax and his assistant, Conseil, onto a Navy expedition to prove the monster's existence. On board with them is the cocky master harpooner Ned Land.\
After months of searching, the "monster" is spotted shortly before it rams the warship. Ned and Aronnax are thrown overboard, and Conseil goes in after Aronnax. The helpless, crippled frigate drifts away, and no one aboard responds to the overboard passengers. The three find a strange-looking metal vessel, and realize the "monster" is a man-made "submerging boat" that appears deserted. Aronnax finds a large viewport and witnesses an underwater funeral.\
Ned, Aronnax, and Conseil attempt to leave in their lifeboat, but the submarine crew stops the castaways. The captain introduces himself as Nemo, master of the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Nautilus_(Verne)"}}{\fldrslt

Nemo was a prisoner there, as were many of his crew. The prisoners are loading a munitions ship. The\'a0

An anguished Nemo tells Aronnax that his actions have saved thousands from death in war; he also discloses that this "hated nation" tortured his wife and son to death while attempting to force him to reveal the secrets of his work. Ned discovers the coordinates of Nemo's secret island base, Vulcania, and releases messages in bottles, hoping somebody will find them.\

Ned goes off alone to explore avenues of escape. While drinking from a pool, he sees human skulls on stakes. Ned runs for his life and rejoins Conseil, and they row away, pursued by cannibals. Aboard ship, the cannibals are repelled by electrical charges through its hull. Nemo is furious with Ned for disobeying his orders, confining him to the brig.\
A warship approaches, firing upon\'a0

After a similar electric charge fails to repel the monster, Nemo and his men surface during a storm to dislodge it. Nemo is caught in one of its tentacles.

Aronnax, Conseil, and Ned are confined to their cabins. The Nautilus's crew also retreat to their cabins at Nemo's instructions. Ned escapes and manages to surface the\'a0

One day, Lady is saddened after her owners begin treating her rather coldly. Jock and Trusty visit her and determine that their change in behavior is due to Darling expecting a baby. While Jock and Trusty try to explain what a baby is, Tramp interrupts the conversation and offers his own thoughts on the matter, making Jock and Trusty take an immediate dislike to the stray and order him out of the yard. As Tramp leaves, he reminds Lady that "when a baby moves in, a dog moves out."\
Eventually, the baby arrives and the couple introduces Lady to the infant, of whom Lady becomes very fond and protective. Soon after, Jim Dear and Darling leave for a trip, with their Aunt Sarah looking after the baby and the house. Aunt Sarah's two trouble-making\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Siamese_cat"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Siamese cats}}, Si and Am, deliberately mess up the house and trick her into thinking that Lady attacked them. Aunt Sarah then takes Lady to a pet shop to get a muzzle. Terrified, Lady flees, only to be pursued by a trio of stray dogs. Tramp rescues her, fighting off the vicious strays, and finds a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Beaver"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 beaver}}\'a0at the local zoo who can remove the muzzle. Later, Tramp shows Lady how he lives "footloose and collar-free", eventually leading into a candlelit dinner at Tony's. Lady begins to fall in love with Tramp, but she chooses to return home in order to watch over the baby. Tramp offers to escort Lady back home, but when Tramp decides to chase hens around a farmyard for fun, Lady is captured by the dog catcher and brought to the local dog pound. While at the pound, the other dogs (including Peg and Bull, who have been caught) reveal to Lady that Tramp has had multiple girlfriends in the past, and they feel it is unlikely that he will ever settle down. Lady is eventually claimed by Aunt Sarah, who chains her in the backyard as punishment for running away.\
Jock and Trusty visit to comfort Lady, but when Tramp arrives to apologize, Lady angrily confronts him about his past girlfriends and failure to rescue her from the pound. Tramp sadly leaves, but immediately thereafter a rat sneaks into the house. Lady sees the rat and barks frantically at it, but Aunt Sarah tells her to be quiet. Tramp hears her barking and rushes back, entering the house and cornering the rat in the nursery. Lady breaks free and rushes to the nursery, where Tramp inadvertently knocks over the baby's crib before ultimately killing the rat. The commotion alerts Aunt Sarah, who sees both dogs in the room and thinks they are trying to harm the baby. She pushes Tramp in a closet and locks Lady in the basement, then calls the pound to take Tramp away. Jim Dear and Darling return home as the dog catcher departs, and when they release Lady, she leads them to the dead rat. Overhearing everything, Jock and Trusty chase after the dog catcher's wagon. The dogs are able to track down the wagon and scare the horses, causing the wagon to crash. Jim Dear arrives in a taxi with Lady, and she reunites with Tramp, but their joy is short-lived when they find Trusty pinned underneath the wagon's wheel, motionless, with Jock howling mournfully.\
That Christmas, Tramp has been adopted into the family, and he and Lady have started their own family, with Lady having given birth to a litter of four puppies (three daughters who look identical to Lady and\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Scamp_(comics)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 one son who looks identical to Tramp}}). Jock comes to see the family along with Trusty, who is still alive and merely suffered a broken leg, which is still healing. Thanks to the puppies, Trusty has a fresh audience for his old stories, but he has forgotten them.\

Eager to join the fighting, Roberts repeatedly requests a transfer. Morton is forced by regulation to forward his requests, but refuses to endorse them, which means that they are always rejected. Roberts shares quarters with\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Ensign_(rank)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Ensign}}\'a0Frank Thurlowe Pulver ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Jack_Lemmon"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Jack Lemmon}}). Pulver spends most of his time idling in his bunk and avoids the captain at all costs, so much so, that Morton is initially unaware that Pulver is part of the crew. Once discovered, Pulver cowers before Morton despite bold ideas for revenge expressed to the crew.\
Roberts surreptitiously requests and is granted crew\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Shore_leave"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 liberty}}\'a0from one of Morton\'92s superiors; a port captain who wishes to reward the\'a0
\f1\i Reluctant's
\f0\i0 \'a0crew for meeting a difficult resupply schedule. The liberty is supposed to be at their next resupply stop, but when the ship reaches an idyllic South Pacific island, Morton denies the crew their much-needed shore leave. In private, Morton tells Roberts that the crew will not get liberty as long as he continues to request a transfer and writes letters regarding disharmony aboard the ship, which endanger Morton's chances of promotion. Morton strikes a bargain with Roberts: In exchange for never requesting another transfer, never bending Morton's rules, and never revealing what has made him change his attitude, Morton will grant the crew liberty.\
Ashore, the crew lets loose after months of pent-up frustration. Many crewmen are arrested and hauled back to the ship by the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Military_police"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 military police}}\'a0and the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Shore_patrol"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 shore patrol}}. The next morning, Morton is reprimanded by the port captain and ordered to leave port immediately. Morton is almost speechless with rage at the black mark on his sterling record.\
Meanwhile, the crewmen are mystified by Roberts\'92 new strictness. Morton deceives them into thinking that Roberts is trying to get a promotion. When a crew member informs Roberts of a new Navy policy which might assist him in getting a transfer despite the captain's opposition, Roberts refuses to take advantage of it.\
News of the Allied victory in Europe depresses Roberts further, knowing the war may end soon without his ever seeing combat. Inspired by a patriotic radio speech celebrating\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/VE_Day"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 VE Day}}, Roberts throws Morton's prized palm tree overboard. The captain demands the identity of the culprit, but no one steps forward. He eventually realizes that Roberts is the only person aboard with the nerve to do it. Morton summons him to his quarters and accuses him of the deed. An open microphone reveals to the crew what changed Roberts.\
Weeks later, Roberts receives an unexpected transfer. "Doc" ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/William_Powell"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 William Powell}}), the ship's doctor and Roberts' friend, confides to him that the crew risked court-martial by submitting a transfer request with Morton's forged\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Imprimatur#Other_senses"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 imprimatur}}. Before he leaves, the crew presents Roberts with a handmade medal, the Order of the Palm, for "action against the enemy".\
Several weeks later, Pulver, who has been appointed cargo officer, receives a couple of letters. The first is from Roberts, who speaks enthusiastically about his new assignment aboard the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Destroyer"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 destroyer}}\'a0USS\'a0

He goes on to say that he would rather have the Order of the Palm than the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Medal_of_Honor"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Medal of Honor}}. The second letter is from a college classmate of Pulver's who is also assigned to the\'a0

Incensed, Pulver throws the captain\'92s replacement palm tree overboard. He then marches into Morton's cabin, openly bragging about it and brazenly demanding to know why Morton has cancelled the showing of a film that night. Morton slowly shakes his head, realizing that his problems have not gone away.\

Moses saves an elderly woman from being crushed not knowing that she is his biological mother, Yoshebel, and he reprimands the taskmaster and overseer Baka.\

She kills Memnet but reveals the story to Moses only after he finds the piece of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Levite"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Levite}}\'a0cloth he was wrapped in as a baby, which Memnet had kept. Moses follows Bithiah to Yoshebel's house where he meets his biological mother, Brother Aaron, and Sister Miriam.\
Moses learns more about the slaves by working with them. Nefretiri urges him to return to the palace so he may help his people when he becomes pharaoh, to which he agrees after he completes a final task. Moses saves Joshua from death by killing Baka, telling Joshua that he too is Hebrew.

Moses warns him the next plague to fall upon Egypt will be summoned by Pharaoh himself. Enraged at the plagues, Rameses orders all first-born Hebrews to die, but a cloud of death instead kills all the firstborn of Egypt, including the child of Rameses and Nefretiri. Angrily, Pharaoh exiles the Hebrews, which begins\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/The_Exodus"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 the Exodus}}\'a0from Egypt.\

Moses uses God's help to stop the Egyptians with a pillar of fire and parts the Red Sea. After the Hebrews make it to safety, Moses releases the walls of water, drowning the Egyptian army. A devastated Rameses returns empty-handed to Nefretiri, stating that he now acknowledges Moses's god as God.\
Moses again ascends the mountain with Joshua. Impatiently, Dathan urges a reluctant Aaron to construct a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Golden_calf"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 golden calf}}\'a0idol as a gift for Rameses.

The commandant, Colonel Saito, informs them that all prisoners, regardless of rank, are to work on the construction of a railway bridge over the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Khwae_Yai_River"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 River Kwai}}\'a0that will connect Bangkok and Rangoon. The senior British officer, Lieutenant Colonel Nicholson, informs Saito that the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Geneva_Convention_(1929)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Geneva Conventions}}\'a0exempt officers from manual labour. Nicholson later forbids any escape attempts because they had been ordered by headquarters to surrender, and escapes could be seen as defiance of orders.\
At the morning assembly, Nicholson orders his officers to remain behind when the enlisted men march off to work. Saito threatens to have them shot, but Nicholson refuses to back down. When Major Clipton, the British medical officer, warns Saito there are too many witnesses for him to get away with murder, Saito leaves the officers standing all day in the intense heat. That evening, the officers are placed in a punishment hut, while Nicholson is locked in an iron box.\
Meanwhile, three prisoners attempt to escape. Two are shot dead, but\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/United_States_Navy"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 United States Navy}}\'a0Commander Shears gets away, although badly wounded. He stumbles into a village of natives, who nurse him back to health and then help him leave by boat.\
Meanwhile, the prisoners work as little as possible and sabotage whatever they can. Should Saito fail to meet his deadline, he would be obliged to commit\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Seppuku"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 ritual suicide}}. Desperate, he uses the anniversary of Japan's victory in the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Russo-Japanese_War"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Russo-Japanese War}}\'a0as an excuse to save face and announces a general amnesty, releasing Nicholson and his officers and exempting them from manual labour.\
Nicholson is shocked by the poor job being done by his men. Over the protests of some of his officers, he orders Captain Reeves and Major Hughes to design and build a proper bridge to maintain his men's morale. As the Japanese engineers had chosen a poor site, the original construction is abandoned and a new bridge begun downstream.\
Shears is enjoying his hospital stay in Ceylon when British Major Warden invites him to join a mission to destroy the bridge before it is completed. Shears is so appalled, he confesses he is not an officer; he impersonated one, expecting better treatment from the Japanese. Warden responds that he already knew and that the American Navy agreed to transfer him to the British to avoid embarrassment. Realising he has no choice, Shears volunteers.\
Meanwhile, Nicholson drives his men hard to complete the bridge on time. For him, its completion will exemplify the ingenuity and hard work of the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/British_Army"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 British Army}}\'a0long after the war's end. When he asks that their Japanese counterparts pitch in as well, a resigned Saito replies that he has already given the order. Clipton expresses grave doubts about the sanity of Colonel Nicholson's efforts to build the bridge in order to show up his Japanese captors.\
The four commandos parachute in, though one is killed on landing. Later, Warden is wounded in an encounter with a Japanese patrol and has to be carried on a litter. He, Shears, and Canadian Lieutenant Joyce reach the river in time with the assistance of Siamese women bearers and their village chief, Khun Yai. Under cover of darkness, Shears and Joyce plant explosives on the bridge towers below the water line.\
A train carrying important dignitaries and soldiers is scheduled to be the first to cross the bridge the following day, so Warden waits to destroy both. However, by daybreak the water level has dropped, exposing the wire connecting the explosives to the detonator. Nicholson spots the wire and brings it to Saito's attention. As the train approaches, they hurry down to the riverbank to investigate.\
Joyce, manning the detonator, breaks cover and stabs Saito to death. Nicholson yells for help, while attempting to stop Joyce from reaching the detonator. When Joyce is mortally wounded by Japanese fire, Shears swims across the river, but is himself shot. Recognising the dying Shears, Nicholson exclaims, "What have I done?" Warden fires a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Mortar_(weapon)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 mortar}}, wounding Nicholson. The dying colonel stumbles towards the detonator and collapses on the plunger just in time to blow up the bridge and send the train hurtling into the river below. Warden turns toward the only survivors of the commando raid, the women bearers, and begs their forgiveness for having to kill Joyce and Shears, and throws the mortar launcher away in disgust, and prepares to leave. Clipton, observing the carnage, shakes his head muttering, "Madness!, Madness!".\

The women beg Esther to conceal their condition from Judah so that he may remember them as they were before, so she tells him that they died. This false revelation changes Judah's mind, and he decides to seek vengeance on Messala by competing against him in the chariot race. During the chariot race, Messala drives a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Scythed_chariot"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 chariot with blades on the hubs}}\'a0to tear apart competing vehicles. He attempts to destroy Judah's chariot but wrecks his own instead. Messala is fatally trampled on by another passing chariot, while Judah wins the race. Before dying, Messala tells Judah that "the race is not over" and, in one last act of pure hatred, tells him to search for his family in the Valley of the Lepers "if you can even recognise them".\
Judah visits the nearby leper colony, where he confronts Esther while she is delivering supplies for his mother and sister. Esther convinces Judah to remain hidden from them for now and not break Miriam's wishes.

As Jesus is being marched through the streets he collapses while carrying his cross. Judah recognizes him as the man who gave him water years before, and returns the gesture.

The boys, particularly Ernst, also build inventions to provide modern amenities to the family such as drawing water and preserving food.\
Fritz and Ernst head off to explore the island to see if anyone else lives on it, or if it is connected to any other lands. While at a distant corner of the island, they again spot the pirates who originally drove them into the storm. The pirates have captured another ship and have the ship's captain, Captain Moreland ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Cecil_Parker"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Cecil Parker}}), and cabin boy "Bertie" captives for ransom. Fritz and Ernst rescue Bertie but Captain Moreland, Bertie's grandfather, stays behind. The three dodge the pirates and head back to the family's tree house. En route, they discover that Bertie is really Roberta ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Janet_Munro"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Janet Munro}}) and not a boy at all. The three fend off snakes and hyenas as they head home and even rescue a zebra foal, then lead it home. They arrive back at the treehouse at Christmas.\
Father realizes the pirates will try to reclaim Roberta and decides to make a stand against them. Defenses are prepared by building booby-traps and fortifying a rocky outcropping. They blow up the ship's wreckage in an attempt to make it difficult for the pirates to remember where the family went aground. While prepping for the pirate attack, Fritz and Ernst vie for the affections of Roberta. Ernst is more studious and attempts to impress her with his knowledge and intelligence while Fritz, older and more experienced, uses his charm and physical attributes to attract her. Fritz and Ernst eventually come to blows over her and are stopped only by the intervention of Father.

While prepping for the race (everyone has an animal to ride: Francis has the elephant, Ernst the ostrich, Roberta the zebra, the monkey on Duke, etc.), Mother fires the gun to signal the start of the race; the pirates, who are at that time sailing the coast looking for the place they last saw the ship that brought the family to the island, hear the gun and know the family is near.\
Led by their captain ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Sessue_Hayakawa"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Sessue Hayakawa}}), the pirates storm the island. The family manages a brave defense but are sorely pressed. Their defenses include pits with a tiger in one pit, rock piles, a log pile and coconut bombs (hollowed out coconuts filled with gunpowder with a fuse), all of which cause problems for the attacking pirates. When the pirate leader waves a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/White_flag"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 white flag}}\'a0the family imagines they have routed the pirates, but the pirates instead are sneaking around the back of the fort. Francis' much-maligned "pirate alarm" is the only thing that warns them of the surprise attack. They begin defending the fortress but are soon down to only a few shots with their muskets. At this critical moment, a ship appears on the horizon captained by Roberta's grandfather Captain Moreland and fires its cannons while the retreating pirates are trying to make a desperate escape. The cannon fire hits the pirate ship while the family rejoices. Father, Mother and Francis choose to remain on the island with Duke, Turk, and Francis' collection of animals while Captain Moreland notes that Father will likely be recommended as Governor of the new colony. As for the rest of the family, Ernst chooses to return to Europe with the rescuers in order to enroll in a university to continue his studies while Fritz and Roberta plan to marry (presumably by virtue of her grandfather's sea captaincy) and make New Switzerland their home.\

One of these, a proud and gifted\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Thrace"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Thracian}}\'a0named Spartacus ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Kirk_Douglas"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Kirk Douglas}}), is so uncooperative in his position in a mining pit that he is sentenced to death by starvation. By chance, he is displayed to unctuous Roman businessman Lentulus Batiatus ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Peter_Ustinov"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Peter Ustinov}}), who - impressed by his ferocity - purchases Spartacus for his gladiatorial school, where he instructs trainer Marcellus ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Charles_McGraw"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Charles McGraw}}) to not overdo his indoctrination because he thinks "he has quality". Amid the abuse, Spartacus forms a quiet relationship with a serving woman named Varinia ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Jean_Simmons"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Jean Simmons}}), whom he refuses to rape when she is sent to "entertain" him in his cell. Spartacus and Varinia are subsequently forced to endure numerous humiliations for defying the conditions of servitude.\
Batiatus receives a visit from the immensely wealthy Roman senator\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Marcus_Licinius_Crassus"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Marcus Licinius Crassus}}\'a0({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Laurence_Olivier"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Laurence Olivier}}), who aims to become dictator of the stagnant republic. Crassus buys Varinia on a whim, and for the amusement of his companions arranges for Spartacus and three others to fight in pairs. When Spartacus is disarmed, his opponent, an\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Ethnic_groups_of_Africa"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 African}}\'a0named Draba ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Woody_Strode"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Woody Strode}}), spares his life in a burst of defiance and attacks the Roman audience, but is killed by an arena guard and Crassus. The next day, with the ludus' atmosphere still tense over this episode, Batiatus takes Varinia away to Crassus's house in Rome. Spartacus kills Marcellus, who was taunting him over his affections, and their fight escalates into a riot. The gladiators overwhelm their guards and escape into the Italian countryside.\
Spartacus is elected chief of the fugitives and decides to lead them out of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Italy"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Italy}}\'a0and back to their homes. They plunder Roman country estates as they go, collecting enough money to buy sea transport from Rome's foes, the pirates of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Cilicia"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Cilicia}}. Countless other slaves join the group, making it as large as an army. One of the new arrivals is Varinia, who escaped while being delivered to Crassus. Another is a slave entertainer named Antoninus ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Tony_Curtis"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Tony Curtis}}), who also fled Crassus's service. Privately, Spartacus feels mentally inadequate because of his lack of education during years of servitude. However, he proves an excellent leader and organizes his diverse followers into a tough and self-sufficient community. Varinia, now his informal wife, becomes pregnant by him, and he also comes to regard the spirited Antoninus as a sort of son.\
The\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Roman_Senate"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Roman Senate}}\'a0becomes increasingly alarmed as Spartacus defeats the multiple armies it sends against him. Crassus's populist opponent Gracchus ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Charles_Laughton"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Charles Laughton}}) knows that his rival will try to use the crisis as a justification for seizing control of the Roman army. To try and prevent this, Gracchus channels as much military power as possible into the hands of his own protege, a young senator named Julius Caesar ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/John_Gavin"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 John Gavin}}). Although Caesar lacks Crassus's contempt for the lower classes of Rome, he mistakes the man's rigid outlook for nobility. Thus, when Gracchus reveals that he has bribed the Cilicians to get Spartacus out of Italy and rid Rome of the slave army, Caesar regards such tactics as beneath him and goes over to Crassus.\
Crassus uses a bribe of his own to make the pirates abandon Spartacus and has the Roman army secretly force the rebels away from the coastline towards Rome. Amid panic that Spartacus means to sack the city, the Senate gives Crassus absolute power. Now surrounded by Romans, Spartacus convinces his men to die fighting. Just by rebelling and proving themselves human, he says that they have struck a blow against slavery. In the ensuing battle, after initially breaking the ranks of Crassus's legions, the slave army ends up trapped between Crassus and two other forces advancing from behind, and most of them are massacred. Afterward, the Romans try to locate the rebel leader for special punishment by offering a pardon (and return to enslavement) if the men will identify Spartacus, living or dead. Every surviving man responds by shouting "I'm Spartacus!" (an idea from Fast's novel, not documented by history). As a result, Crassus has them all sentenced to death by\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Crucifixion"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 crucifixion}}\'a0along the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Via_Appia"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Via Appia}}\'a0between Rome and\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Capua"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Capua}}, where the revolt began.\
Meanwhile, Crassus has found Varinia and Spartacus's newborn son and has taken them prisoner. He is disturbed by the idea that Spartacus can command more love and loyalty than he can and hopes to compensate by making Varinia as devoted to him as she was to her former husband. When she rejects him, he furiously seeks out Spartacus (whom he recognizes from having watched him at Batiatus' school) and forces him to fight Antoninus to the death. The survivor is to be crucified, along with all the other men captured after the great battle. Spartacus kills Antoninus to spare him this terrible fate. The incident leaves Crassus worried about Spartacus's potential to live in legend as a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Martyr"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 martyr}}. In other matters, he is also worried about Caesar, whom he senses will someday eclipse him.\
Gracchus, having seen Rome fall into tyranny, commits suicide. Before doing so, he bribes his friend Batiatus to rescue Spartacus's family from Crassus and carry them away to freedom. On the way out of Rome, the group passes under Spartacus's cross. Varinia is able to comfort him in his dying moments by showing him his little son, who will grow up free and knowing who his father was.\
During a lunchtime tryst in a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Phoenix,_Arizona"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Phoenix}},\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Arizona"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Arizona}}\'a0hotel, real-estate secretary,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Marion_Crane"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Marion Crane}}, and her boyfriend, Sam Loomis, discuss how they cannot afford to get married because of Sam's debts. After lunch, Marion returns to work, where a client leaves a $40,000 cash payment on a property. Marion's boss asks her to deposit the money in the bank, and allows her to leave work early after she complains of a headache. Once home, she decides to steal the money and drive to Fairvale,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/California"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 California}}, where Sam lives.\
En route to Fairvale, Marion pulls over on the side of the road and falls asleep; she is awakened by a state patrol trooper. Suspicious about her skittish behavior, he follows her as she drives away. Hoping to lose him, Marion stops at a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Bakersfield,_California"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Bakersfield}}, California automobile dealership and trades in her\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Ford_Mainline"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Ford Mainline}}, with its Arizona license plates, for a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Ford_Custom"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Ford Custom}}\'a0300 with California tags. The officer sees Marion at the car dealership and eyes her suspiciously as she abruptly drives away.\
During a heavy rainstorm, Marion stops for the night at the Bates Motel. The proprietor,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Norman_Bates"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Norman Bates}}, invites her to share a light dinner after she checks in. She accepts his invitation but overhears an argument between Norman and\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Norma_Bates_(Psycho)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 his mother}}\'a0about bringing a woman into their\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Gothic_Revival_architecture"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Gothic}}\'a0house, which sits perched above the motel. Instead they eat in the motel parlor, where he tells her about his life with his mother, who is mentally ill and forbids him to have an independent life.\
Moved by Norman's story, Marion decides to drive back to Phoenix in the morning to return the stolen money, which she hides in a folded newspaper on the nightstand. As she showers, a shadowy figure stabs her to death with a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Chef%27s_knife"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 chef's knife}}.

He cleans up the crime scene, putting Marion's corpse and her possessions\'97including the stolen money\'97into the trunk of her car and sinking it in the swamps near the motel.\
A week later, Marion's sister\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Lila_Crane"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Lila}}\'a0arrives in Fairvale and confronts Sam about Marion's whereabouts. Private investigator Milton Arbogast approaches them and confirms that Marion is wanted for stealing the $40,000. He sleuths local hotels and motels, and Norman's evasive and inconsistent answers arouse his suspicion. After hearing that Marion met Norman's mother, he asks to speak with her, but Norman refuses to allow it. Arbogast updates Sam and Lila about his search for Marion and promises to phone again soon. He goes to the Bates' home in search of Norman's mother; as he reaches the top of the stairs, he is murdered.\
When Lila and Sam do not hear from Arbogast, Sam visits the motel. He sees a figure in the house who he assumes is Mrs. Bates, but she ignores his knocking. Lila and Sam go to the local deputy sheriff, who informs them that Mrs. Bates died in a murder-suicide ten years ago. The sheriff concludes that Arbogast lied to Sam and Lila so he could pursue Marion and the money. Convinced that some ill has befallen Arbogast, Lila and Sam make their way to the motel. Norman carries his mother from her room and hides her in the fruit cellar against her will.\
At the motel, Sam distracts Norman by engaging in conversation while Lila cases the property and sneaks inside the house. After Sam grills him, Norman becomes agitated, knocks Sam out, and rushes to the house. Lila hides in the cellar, where she finds Mrs. Bates in a chair. Lila turns her around and discovers she is a mummified corpse. Lila screams as Norman runs into the cellar, holding a knife and wearing his mother's clothes and a wig. Before Norman can attack Lila, Sam, having regained consciousness, subdues him.\
At the courthouse, a psychiatrist explains that Norman murdered Mrs. Bates and her lover ten years ago out of jealousy. Unable to bear the guilt, he\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Exhumation"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 exhumed}}\'a0her corpse and began to treat it as if she were still alive.

This "Mother" personality is jealous and possessive: whenever Norman feels attracted to a woman, "Mother" kills her. As "Mother", Norman killed two young girls before stabbing Marion and Arbogast to death. The psychiatrist says the "Mother" personality has taken permanent hold of Norman's mind. While Norman sits in a holding cell, "Mother"'s\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Voice-over"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 voice-over}}\'a0protests that the murders were Norman's doing. Marion's car is pulled out of the swamp.\

Bored with bachelor life, Pongo decides to find a wife for Roger and a mate for himself. While watching various female dog-human pairs out the window, he spots the perfect one, a woman named Anita and her female Dalmatian, Perdita. He quickly gets Roger out of the house and drags him through the park to arrange a meeting. He and Anita fall in love and get married.\
Later, Perdita gives birth to a litter of 15 puppies. That same night, they are visited by\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Cruella_De_Vil"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Cruella De Vil}}, a wealthy former schoolmate of Anita's.

When Tibbs learns they are going to be made into dog-skin\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Fur_coat"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 fur coats}}, Colonel quickly sends word back to London. Upon receiving the message, Pongo and Perdita leave town to retrieve their puppies.

Meanwhile, Tibbs overhears Cruella ordering Jasper and Horace to kill the puppies that night out of fear the police will soon find them. In response, Tibbs attempts to rescue them while Jasper and Horace are preoccupied watching television, but they finish their show and come for them before he can get them out of the house. Pongo and Perdita break in and confront Jasper and Horace just as they are about to kill the puppies. While the adult dogs attack them, Colonel and Tibbs guide the puppies from the house.\
After a happy reunion with their own puppies, Pongo and Perdita realize there are dozens of others with them, 99 altogether including their own. Shocked at Cruella's plans, Pongo and Perdita decide to adopt all of the puppies, certain that Roger and Anita would never reject them. The Dalmatians begin making their way back to London through deep snow, as all open water is frozen solid. Other animals help them along the way, while Cruella, Jasper, and Horace chase them. In one town, they cover themselves with soot to disguise themselves as\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Labrador_Retriever"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Labradors}}, then pile inside a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Moving_van"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 moving van}}\'a0bound for London. As it is leaving, melting snow clears off the soot and Cruella sees them. Enraged, she follows the van in her car and rams it, but Jasper and Horace, who try to cut it off from above, end up crashing into her. Both vehicles are smashed to smithereens and fall into a deep ravine, leaving Cruella and her henchmen stranded and defeated at last. Cruella yells in frustration as the van drives away.\
Back in London, Roger and Anita are attempting to celebrate Christmas and his first big hit, a song about Cruella, but they miss their canine companions. Suddenly, barking is heard outside and, after their nanny opens the door, the house is filled with dogs. After wiping away the rest of the soot, they are delighted to realize their pets have returned home. After counting 84 extra puppies, they decide to use the money from the song to buy a large house in the country so they can keep all 101 Dalmatians.\

Riff decides that his best friend Tony, the co-founder of the Jets who left the gang, should fight. Riff invites Tony to the dance, but Tony is uninterested. He tells Riff that he senses something important will happen, which Riff suggests could have a correlation with the dance.\
Bernardo's younger sister, Maria, tells her best friend and Bernardo's girlfriend, Anita, how excited she is about the dance. At the dance, the gangs and girls refuse to intermingle. Tony arrives and he and Maria fall in love. However, Bernardo angrily demands Tony stay away from her. Riff proposes a meeting with Bernardo at Doc's drug store.\
Maria is sent home; Anita argues that Bernardo is overprotective of Maria and they compare the advantages of Puerto Rico and the United States.\
Tony discreetly visits Maria on her fire escape, where they reaffirm their love. Krupke, who suspects the Jets are planning something, visits them and warns them not to cause trouble. When the Sharks arrive, both groups agree to have the showdown the following evening under the highway, with a one-on-one fist fight. When Schrank arrives, the gangs feign friendship. Schrank orders the Sharks out and unsuccessfully tries to discover information about the fight.\
The next day at the bridal shop, Anita accidentally tells Maria about the rumble. Tony arrives to see Maria, which shocks Anita. They profess their love and Anita warns them about the consequences if Bernardo learns of their relationship. Maria has Tony promise to prevent the rumble. Tony and Maria fantasize about their wedding ceremony.\
The Jets and Sharks approach the area under the highway. Tony arrives to stop the fight, but Bernardo antagonizes him. Unwilling to watch Tony be humiliated, Riff initiates a knife fight. Tony tries to intervene, which leads to Bernardo killing Riff. Tony kills Bernardo with Riff's knife and a melee ensues. Police sirens blare and everyone flees, leaving behind the dead bodies.\
Maria waits for Tony on the rooftop of her apartment building when Chino arrives and tells her what happened. Tony arrives and explains what transpired and asks for her forgiveness before he turns himself in to the police. Maria confirms her love for him and asks Tony to stay with her.\
The Jets have reassembled outside a garage, with their new leader, Ice having them focus on reacting to the police. Anybodys arrives and warns them that Chino is now after Tony. Ice sends the Jets to warn Tony.\
Anita enters the apartment while Tony and Maria are in the bedroom. Tony and Maria arrange to meet at Doc's, where they will pick up getaway money to elope. Anita spots Tony leaving through the window and chides Maria for the relationship, but Maria convinces her to help them elope.\
Schrank arrives and questions Maria about the rumble. To cover for Tony, Maria has Anita tell him that Maria is detained from meeting him. When Anita reaches Doc's, the Jets harass her, until Doc intervenes. Anita declares that Bernardo was right about them and that Chino killed Maria. Doc banishes the Jets and gives Tony his getaway money in the basement and delivers Anita's message. Tony runs into the streets, shouting for Chino to kill him as well.\
In the playground next to Doc's, Tony spots Maria and they run toward each other, only for Chino to shoot Tony. The Jets and Sharks arrive to find Maria holding Tony, who dies. Maria stops the gangs from fighting and takes the gun from Chino and threatens to shoot everyone, blaming their hate for the deaths. Schrank, Krupke and Doc arrive and the gangs form a funeral procession, with Maria following. The police arrest Chino and lead him away.\

Lawrence later meets Colonel Brighton, who orders him to keep quiet, make his assessment, and leave. Lawrence ignores Brighton's orders when he meets Faisal. His outspokenness piques the prince's interest.\
Brighton advises Faisal to retreat after a major defeat, but Lawrence proposes a daring\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Battle_of_Aqaba"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 surprise attack on Aqaba}}; its capture would provide a port from which the British could offload much-needed supplies. The town is strongly fortified against a naval assault but only lightly defended on the landward side. He convinces Faisal to provide fifty men, led by a sceptical Sherif Ali. Teenage orphans Daud and Farraj attach themselves to Lawrence as servants. They cross the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Nefud_Desert"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Nefud Desert}}, considered impassable even by the Bedouins, travelling day and night on the last stage to reach water. One of Ali's men, Gasim, succumbs to fatigue and falls off his camel unnoticed during the night. When Lawrence discovers him missing, he turns back and rescues Gasim\'97and Sherif Ali is won over. He gives Lawrence Arab robes to wear.\
Lawrence persuades\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Auda_abu_Tayi"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Auda abu Tayi}}, the leader of the powerful local\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Howeitat"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Howeitat}}\'a0tribe, to turn against the Turks.

Howeitat retaliation would shatter the fragile alliance, so Lawrence declares that he will execute the murderer himself. He is then stunned to discover that the culprit is Gasim, the very man whom he risked his own life to save in the desert, but he shoots him anyway.\
The next morning, the Arabs overrun the Turkish\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Garrison"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 garrison}}.

He is deeply disturbed, however, confessing that he enjoyed executing Gasim, but Allenby brushes aside his qualms. He asks Allenby whether there is any basis for the Arabs' suspicions that the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Sykes%E2%80%93Picot_Agreement"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 British have designs on Arabia}}.

On one raid, Farraj is badly injured. Unwilling to leave him to be tortured by the enemy, Lawrence shoots him dead before fleeing.\
When Lawrence scouts the enemy-held city of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Daraa"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Deraa}}\'a0with Ali, he is taken, along with several Arab residents, to the Turkish\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Bey"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Bey}}. Lawrence is stripped, ogled, and prodded.

The experience leaves Lawrence shaken. He returns to British headquarters in Cairo but does not fit in.\
A short time later in\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Jerusalem"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Jerusalem}}, General Allenby urges him to support the "big push" on\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Damascus"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Damascus}}. Lawrence hesitates to return but finally relents.\
Lawrence recruits an army that is motivated more by money than by the Arab cause. They sight a column of retreating Turkish soldiers who have just massacred the residents of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Tafas"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Tafas}}. One of Lawrence's men is from Tafas; he demands, "No prisoners!" When Lawrence hesitates, the man charges the Turks alone and is killed. Lawrence takes up the dead man's battle cry; the result is a slaughter in which Lawrence himself participates. Afterwards, he regrets his actions.\
Lawrence's men take Damascus ahead of Allenby's forces. The Arabs set up a council to administer the city, but the desert tribesmen prove ill-suited for such a task. Despite Lawrence's efforts, they bicker constantly. Unable to maintain the public utilities, the Arabs soon abandon most of the city to the British.\
Lawrence is promoted to\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Colonel_(United_Kingdom)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 colonel}}\'a0and immediately ordered back to Britain, as his usefulness to both Faisal and the British is at an end. As he leaves the city, his automobile is passed by a motorcyclist who leaves a trail of dust in his wake.\
The film begins with narration by Spencer Tracy as the aerial-borne camera sweeps over the Rocky Mountains. "This land has a name today," says Tracy in the opening lines of the film, "and is marked on maps."\
The film then moves into "The Rivers" sequence (considerably to the east of the Rockies).\
Mountain man Linus Rawlings (Stewart) is making his way by horse and waterway through the mountains. He confers with a group of Indians. The scene then shifts to Zebulon Prescott and his family.\
Prescott (Malden) and his family set out west for the frontier via the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Erie_Canal"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Erie Canal}}, the "West", at this time, being the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Ohio_River"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Ohio River}}\'a0country, at the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Battery_Rock"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 southern edge}}\'a0of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Illinois"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Illinois}}.

Linus Rawlings stops at an isolated trading post, run by a murderous clan of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/River_pirate"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 river pirates}}, headed by "Alabama Colonel" Jeb Hawkins ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Walter_Brennan"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Walter Brennan}}).

Dora Hawkins stabs him in the back and Rawlings falls into a deep hole. He is not seriously wounded, and he rescues the Prescott party from a similar fate. The bushwhacking thieves ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Lee_Van_Cleef"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Lee Van Cleef}}\'a0plays one), including Dora and Hawkins, are dispatched, being killed in an attack by Rawlings, in a form of rough frontier justice.\
After Zebulon prays to God for their lost loved ones and commends to Him the thieves' souls "whether You want 'em or not", the settlers continue down the river, but their raft is caught in\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Rapids"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 rapids}}, and Zebulon and his wife Rebecca ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Agnes_Moorehead"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Agnes Moorehead}}) drown.

They are in turn tailed by Grant, who kills one of them after Bond is taken back to his hotel, stealing their car and dumping it outside the Soviet Consulate in order to provoke hostilities between British and Soviet Intelligence. In response, the Soviets bomb Kerim's office with a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Limpet_mine"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 limpet mine}}; Kerim, however, is away from his desk for a tryst with his mistress. He and Bond then investigate the attack by spying on a Soviet consulate meeting through a periscope installed in the underground aqueducts beneath Istanbul. Thus, they learn that the Soviet agent Krilencu is responsible for the bombing. Kerim Bey declares it unwise to stay in the city under such circumstances and takes Bond to a rural\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Romani_people"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 gypsy}}\'a0settlement. However, Krilencu learns of this and promptly attacks a Gypsy feast, where Bond and Kerim are honoured guests, with a band of hired Bulgarian fighters. Much to Bond's confusion, he is saved from an enemy fighter during the attack by a distant sniper shot from Grant. The following night, Bond and Kerim Bey track Krilencu down to his hideout, where Kerim Bey kills him with Bond's rifle.\
Upon returning to his hotel suite that night, Bond finds Romanova waiting for him in his bed and has sex with her; neither is aware that SPECTRE is filming them. The next day, Romanova heads off for a prearranged rendezvous at\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Hagia_Sophia"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Hagia Sophia}}\'a0to drop off the floor plans for the consulate, with Grant ensuring Bond receives the plans by killing the other Bulgarian tail who attempts to intercept the drop.

On the train, Kerim Bey quickly notices a Soviet security officer named Benz tailing them, prompting him and Bond to subdue him.

However, when the train arrives at the station, Grant intercepts Nash, sent from Station Y, killing the agent before posing as him. After drugging Romanova at dinner, Grant overpowers Bond before taunting him about SPECTRE's involvement in the theft. After disclosing that Romanova was unaware of what was truly going on, believing she was working for Russia, Grant reveals to Bond his plans to leave behind the film SPECTRE took of him and Romanova at the hotel, along with a forged blackmail letter, to make it appear that their deaths were the result of a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Murder-suicide"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 murder-suicide}}, to scandalise the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/United_Kingdom"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 British}}\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/British_intelligence_community"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 intelligence community}}. Bond quickly convinces him to accept a bribe of gold sovereigns in exchange for a final cigarette, tricking Grant into setting off the booby trap in his attach\'e9 case. This distracts Grant enough for Bond to attack him in a brutal brawl. In the ensuing fight, Bond narrowly gains the upper hand, stabbing Grant with the case's concealed knife before strangling him with his own\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Garrotte"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 garrotte}}. Bond then drags the barely conscious Romanova from the train, which has been stopped by a SPECTRE accomplice, where he hijacks Grant's getaway truck and flees the scene with Romanova.\
Upon hearing the news of Grant's death, Number 1 calls Klebb and Kronsteen onto the carpet to explain what went wrong and remind them that SPECTRE does not tolerate failure. Kronsteen is executed by the henchman Morzeny with a kick from the poison-tipped switchblade in his shoe. Klebb, however, is given one last chance to make good on the mission and acquire the Lektor (which has already been promised to the Russians in a sell-back scheme).\
The next morning, Bond's stolen truck is intercepted along its escape route by a SPECTRE helicopter, but 007 destroys the attacking aircraft by shooting its co-pilot with his sniper rifle, causing the man to drop a live hand grenade in the cockpit. Thus, Bond and Romanova make it to Grant's escape boat on the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Dalmatia"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Dalmatian coast}}\'a0and steal that, too, only to be pursued by Morzeny, who leads a squadron of SPECTRE powerboats.

Klebb, however, disguised as a maid, makes one final attempt on Bond and the Lektor. Klebb tries to kick him with a poisoned switchblade shoe, but Romanova shoots her with her own dropped gun. With the mission accomplished, Bond and Romanova leave Venice on a romantic boat ride, in which course Bond throws Grant's blackmail film into the canal.\

Eliza's ambition is to work in a flower shop, but her accent makes that impossible ("Wouldn't It Be Loverly"). The following morning, Eliza shows up at Higgins' home, seeking lessons. Pickering is intrigued and offers to cover all the attendant expenses if Higgins succeeds. Higgins agrees, and describes how women ruin lives ("I'm an Ordinary Man").\
Eliza's father, Alfred P. Doolittle ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Stanley_Holloway"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Stanley Holloway}}), a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Waste_collector"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 dustman}}, learns of his daughter's new residence ("With a Little Bit of Luck"). He shows up at Higgins' house three days later, ostensibly to protect his daughter's virtue, but in reality simply to extract some money from Higgins, and is bought off with \'a35. Higgins is impressed by the man's honesty, his natural gift for language, and especially his brazen lack of morals. Higgins recommends Alfred to a wealthy American who is interested in morality.\
Eliza endures Higgins' demanding teaching methods and treatment of her personally ("Just You Wait"). She makes little progress, but just as she, Higgins, and Pickering are about to give up, Eliza finally "gets it" ("The Rain in Spain"); she instantly begins to speak with an impeccable\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Received_Pronunciation"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 upper class accent}}\'a0("I Could Have Danced All Night").\
As a trial run, Higgins takes her to\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Ascot_Racecourse"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Ascot Racecourse}}\'a0("Ascot Gavotte"), where she makes a good impression initially, only to shock everyone by a sudden lapse into vulgar Cockney while cheering on a horse. Higgins partly conceals a grin behind his hand. At Ascot, she meets Freddy Eynsford-Hill ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Jeremy_Brett"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Jeremy Brett}}), a young, upper-class man who becomes infatuated with her ("On the Street Where You Live"). Higgins then takes Eliza to an embassy ball for the final test, where she dances with a foreign prince.

However, Eliza's hard work is barely acknowledged, with all the praise going to Higgins ("You Did It"). This and his callous treatment towards her afterwards, especially his indifference to her future, causes her to walk out on him, leaving him mystified by her ingratitude ("Just You Wait (Reprise)"). Outside, Freddy is still waiting ("On the Street Where You Live (Reprise)"), and greets Eliza, who is irritated by him as all he does is talk ("Show Me"). Eliza tries to return to her old life, but finds that she no longer fits in. She meets her father, who has been left a large fortune by the wealthy American to whom Higgins had recommended him, and is resigned to marrying Eliza's stepmother. Alfred feels that Higgins has ruined him, lamenting that he is now bound by "middle-class morality" ("Get Me to the Church On Time"). Eliza eventually ends up visiting Higgins' mother ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Gladys_Cooper"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Gladys Cooper}}), who is outraged at her son's callous behaviour.\
The next day, Higgins finds Eliza gone and searches for her ("A Hymn to Him"), eventually finding her at his mother's house. Higgins attempts to talk Eliza into coming back to him. He becomes angered when she announces that she is going to marry Freddy and become Karpathy's assistant ("Without You"). He makes his way home, stubbornly predicting that she will come crawling back. However, he comes to the unsettling realization that she has become an important part of his life ("I've Grown Accustomed to Her Face"). As he listens to a recording of Eliza's voice, she reappears in the doorway behind him, turning off the recording and saying in her old Cockney accent, "I washed my hands and face before I come, I did." Higgins looks surprised, then pleased, before asking where his slippers are.\

Goldfinger reveals that his plan is to rob the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/United_States_Bullion_Depository"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 U.S. Bullion Depository}}\'a0at\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Fort_Knox"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Fort Knox}}\'a0by releasing\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Neurotoxin"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Delta 9 nerve gas}}\'a0into the atmosphere. After Bond is recaptured by Pussy, Goldfinger has the mafiosi killed using the gas.\
Bond points out to Goldfinger that his plan to rob the depository will not work, as he will not have enough time to move the gold before the Americans intervene. Goldfinger hints he does not intend to steal the gold, and Bond deduces that Goldfinger will detonate a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Dirty_bomb"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 dirty bomb}}\'a0inside the vault, designed to render the gold useless for 58 years. This will increase the value of Goldfinger's own gold and give the Chinese an advantage from the potential economic chaos. Goldfinger subtly threatens that should the Americans attempt to locate the bomb or interfere with his plan, he will simply have it detonated somewhere else of significance in the United States.\
Operation Grand Slam begins with Pussy Galore's Flying Circus spraying the gas over Fort Knox, seemingly killing all of the military and government personnel nearby including Felix. Goldfinger's private army breaks into Fort Knox and accesses the vault as Goldfinger arrives in a helicopter with the atomic device. In the vault, his henchman Kisch handcuffs Bond to the bomb. Unbeknownst to Goldfinger however, Bond has convinced Galore to alert the Americans and replace the gas with a harmless substance. The troops arise and attack, killing many of Goldfinger's men. Seeing this, Goldfinger locks the vault, takes off his coat, revealing a US Army colonel's uniform, and kills Mr. Ling and several troops, before escaping. Kisch realizes they are trapped and attempts to stop the bomb, but Oddjob throws him to his death. Bond frees himself with Kisch's handcuff keys, but the superhumanly strong Oddjob batters him before he can disarm the bomb. Eventually Bond manages to electrocute Oddjob, then forces the lock off the bomb using gold bullion bars from the vault, but ultimately is unable to disarm it. After finally killing all of Goldfinger's men, the troops open the vault and rush to disarm the bomb. An atomic specialist who accompanied Leiter arrives with seconds to spare, and simply turns off the device with the timer stopped on "0:07".\

However, Goldfinger hijacks the plane carrying Bond there.

George Banks returns home to learn from his wife, Winifred, that Katie Nanna has left their service after Jane and Michael ran away again. They are returned shortly after by Constable Jones, who reveals the children were chasing a lost kite. The children ask their father to help build a better kite, but he dismisses them. Taking it upon himself to hire a new nanny, Mr. Banks advertises for a stern, no-nonsense nanny. Instead, Jane and Michael present their own advertisement for a kinder, sweeter nanny. Mr. Banks rips up the letter, and throws the scraps in the fireplace, but the remains of the advertisement magically float up, and out into the air.\
The next day, a number of elderly, sour-faced nannies wait outside the Banks' home, but a strong gust of wind blows them away, and Jane and Michael witness a young nanny descending from the sky using her umbrella. Presenting herself to Mr. Banks,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Mary_Poppins_(character)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Mary Poppins}}\'a0calmly produces the children's restored advertisement, and agrees with its requests, but promises the astonished banker she will be firm with his children. As Mr. Banks puzzles over the advertisement's return, Mary Poppins hires herself, and convinces him it was originally his idea. She meets the children, then helps them tidy their nursery through song, before heading out for a walk in the park.\
Outside, they meet Bert, working as a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Street_painting"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 screever}}; Mary Poppins uses her magic to transport the group into one of his drawings.

Mary Poppins later enchants the carousel horses, and participates in a horse race, which she wins. While being asked to describe her victory, Mary Poppins announces the nonsense word "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious}}". However, the outing is ruined when a thunderstorm dissolves Bert's drawings, returning the group to London.\
On another outing, the four meet Uncle Albert, who has floated up in the air due to his uncontrollable laughter; they join him for a tea party on the ceiling, telling jokes.\
Mr. Banks becomes annoyed by the household's cheery atmosphere, and threatens to fire Mary Poppins. Instead, Mary Poppins inverts his attempt by convincing him to take the children to the bank for a day. Mr. Banks takes Jane and Michael to the bank, where they meet Mr. Dawes Sr, and his son. Mr. Dawes aggressively attempts to have Michael invest his\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Twopence_(British_pre-decimal_coin)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 tuppence}}\'a0in the bank, snatching it from him.

The three and Mary Poppins venture onto the rooftops, where they have a song-and-dance number with other chimney sweeps, which spills out into the Banks' home. An incensed Mr. Banks returns, and receives a phone call from his employers. He speaks with Bert, who tells him he should spend more time with his children before they grow up. Jane and Michael give their father Michael's tuppence in the hope to make amends.\
Mr. Banks walks through London to the bank, where he is given a humiliating\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Cashiering"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 cashiering}}, and is dismissed. Looking to the tuppence for words, he blurts out "Supercalifragilisticexpialidocious!", tells one of Uncle Albert's jokes, and happily heads home. Dawes mulls over the joke, but finally "gets" it, and floats up into the air, laughing.\
The next day, the wind changes, meaning Mary Poppins must leave. A happier Mr. Banks is found at home, having fixed his children's kite, and takes the family out to fly it. In the park, the Bankses meet Mr. Dawes Jr, who reveals his father\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Death_from_laughter"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 died laughing}}\'a0from the joke, and re-employs Mr. Banks as a junior partner. With her work done, Mary Poppins flies away, with Bert bidding her farewell, telling her not to stay away too long.\
In 1938, Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman studying to become a nun at\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Nonnberg_Abbey"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Nonnberg Abbey}}\'a0in\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Salzburg"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Salzburg}}. Her love of music and the mountains, her youthful enthusiasm and imagination, and her lack of discipline cause some concern among the nuns. The Mother Abbess, believing Maria would be happier outside the abbey, sends her to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children\'97Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. Liesl, the oldest, is won over after Maria protects her from discovery when she is nearly caught sneaking back into the house after meeting with Rolfe, a messenger boy she is in love with.\
While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children and takes them around Salzburg and the surrounding mountains, and teaches them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend, Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake that concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities, and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain orders her to return to the abbey. Just then he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. Afterwards, he apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay.\
Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes he enter them in the upcoming\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Salzburg_Festival"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Salzburg Festival}}\'a0but the suggestion is immediately rejected by the Captain as he is opposed to his children singing in public. He does agree, however, to organize a grand party at the villa. The night of the party, while guests in formal attire\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Waltz"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 waltz}}\'a0in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace.

Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy while convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. Back at the abbey, when Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her life. After Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. The Captain's feelings for Maria, however, have not changed, and after breaking off his engagement the Captain marries Maria.\
While the Captain and Maria are on their honeymoon, Max enters the children in the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes.

Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slip away and seek shelter at the nearby abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Brownshirts soon arrive and search the abbey, and the family is discovered by Rolfe. Upon seeing Liesl, he hesitates raising the alarm long enough to allow the family time to flee, and the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When the soldiers attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start as two nuns have removed parts of the engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom.\

The head of the school, Reverend Dr. Thorn, introduces Abner to his niece, Jerusha Bromley, a beautiful and pious New England girl who has been pining for Captain Rafer Hoxworth, a whaler who has been at sea for two years and has not written to her. Although Jerusha's parents are not enthused about her marrying the awkward Abner, her uncle persuades them to give him a chance, and also hides the package of letters from Hoxworth that appear at the Bromley home just as Abner arrives.\
Abner is stunned by Jerusha's beauty, and attracted to her despite his attempts to avoid what he considers sinful thoughts, but he completely lacks social graces and makes one embarrassing gaffe after another.

When the other missionaries continue on to Honolulu, the Hales stay behind, living in an uncomfortable hut and building a church. Jerusha tries to change the villagers' tradition of killing unwanted or deformed babies, personally rescuing one baby who has a birthmark. Jerusha goes through a difficult labor to give birth to her own healthy son, tended only by the inexperienced Abner (who excludes the native midwives) and afterwards Abner confesses to her his great love for her, a love he normally feels is sinful and tries to suppress. Abner baptizes his first convert, a young Hawaiian girl named Iliki who works as a servant for the Hales. However, he makes excuses to defer ordaining Keoki as a minister; in reality, he and his superiors have no intentions of ordaining any natives. Keoki eventually realizes that he will never be permitted to become a minister, despite having studied for years, including at Yale. He becomes disillusioned with Christianity as a result.\
Malama, who is a kind, loving and intelligent woman underneath her imperious facade, agrees to learn about Christianity, but will not take the final step to convert because she will have to send away Kelolo, her beloved husband of many years who is also her brother. At the Hales' urging, she enacts a curfew for sailors and forbids girls from swimming out to the ships. The sailors in port riot in protest, led by Captain Hoxworth, who has made a stop on his long whaling voyage. In the midst of the melee, Hoxworth discovers that the love of his life, Jerusha, is in Lahaina and is now the wife of Reverend Hale, whom he already despises for inspiring Malama to enact the restrictions. The sailors partially torch the church, but the Hawaiians help the Hales put out the fire and then chase the sailors back to their ships. To console himself over Jerusha, Hoxworth entices Iliki to sail away with him, and knocks Abner overboard when he comes after her.\
Malama, on her deathbed, agrees to renounce Kelolo and is baptized a Christian right before she dies while saying a final goodbye to Kelolo. Upon the death of the Ali'i Nui, as predicted by the natives, a strong wind begins to blow, destroying the church building (which Abner refused to build in a way that the villagers suggested to let the wind pass through). Soon after her death, Abner hears drums and discovers Kelolo conducting a marriage ceremony for Keoki and Noelani, the new Ali'i Nui. Keoki, rejected as a minister, has turned back to the traditional gods. Keoki also reveals that while his mother Malama agreed to become a Christian in order to set an example for her people, whom she realized must become Christians for their own good as more and more white settlers arrive, she secretly asked that after she was buried in the Christian graveyard, her family move her bones to an undisclosed location where she can be with the old gods, and that Kelolo take her heart back to\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Bora_Bora"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Bora Bora}}, the land of their ancestors. Horrified and enraged, Abner curses the Kanakoa family and the other Hawaiians and tells them God will punish them for their sins.\
Noelani, pregnant by Keoki, gives birth to a horribly deformed baby who cannot be accepted as Ali'i Nui. Jerusha begs Abner to intercede to save the baby, whom she fears will be killed, but he refuses, saying it is God's punishment for Keoki's and Noelani's sin. Keoki drowns the baby in the ocean, causing a rift between Abner and Jerusha. Shortly afterwards, a sailor carries measles into the port of Lahaina. While this is a relatively minor childhood illness to the missionaries and sailors, the native Hawaiians have no resistance, develop high fevers and die in droves. Keoki dies in Abner's arms in a feverish delirium, renouncing God. Abner returns home wracked by sadness and guilt, feeling that he failed in his mission to save Keoki and the other natives from hell. Jerusha, who is worn out from overwork in the hot climate, giving birth to three children, and nursing the sick Hawaiians, tells him that she does not believe God would send loving people like the Hawaiians to hell even if they weren't Christians, and furthermore tells Abner he can help the Hawaiians by giving them what he has always had difficulty giving her - his love. Jerusha soon dies, mourned by Abner, her children, and Captain Hoxworth, who never got over losing her to Abner.\
After Jerusha's death, Abner becomes more loving towards the Hawaiians and works with them to try to prevent white settlers and plantation owners from taking their land. His position is at odds with the other ministers, who have recently voted that it is time for the churches to own land themselves and try to make money from it, something the ministers had avoided before. Abner is reassigned back to New England and his Lahaina church is given to another minister. But Abner refuses to leave Lahaina and says he will stay and continue to preach, in the street if necessary, and without any support from the church organization. He does agree to send the three Hale children back to New England to live with the Bromleys and receive a proper education. After bidding his children goodbye at the dock, Abner returns to his hut to find that a young Hawaiian man has arrived who wishes to be his assistant and help him, something the aging, frail Abner very much needs. He is overjoyed to see that the young man is the baby with the birthmark, now grown to an adult, whom Jerusha saved from being killed many years ago.\
The film centers on the volatile marriage of a middle-aged couple: George, an associate history professor at a small\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/New_England"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 New England}}\'a0college, and Martha, the daughter of the university president. After they return home drunk from a party, Martha reveals she has invited a young married couple, whom she had met at the party, for a drink. The guests arrive \'96 Nick, a biology professor (whom Martha mistakenly believes to be a math professor), and his wife, Honey \'96 at 2:30 am. As the four drink, Martha and George engage in scathing verbal abuse in front of Nick and Honey. The younger couple is first embarrassed and later enmeshed.\
The wives briefly separate from the husbands, and upon their return, Honey reveals that Martha has told her about her and George's son, adding that she understands that the following day (Sunday) will mark his sixteenth birthday. George is visibly angry that Martha has divulged this information.\
Martha taunts George aggressively and he retaliates with his usual passive aggression. Martha tells an embarrassing story about how she humiliated him in front of her father. Martha's taunts continue, and George reacts violently by breaking a bottle. Nick and Honey become increasingly unsettled, and Honey, who has had too much brandy, and has just been whirled violently around the room by George while chanting "Who's afraid of Virginia Woolf?" (to the tune of "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Here_We_Go_Round_the_Mulberry_Bush"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Here We Go Round the Mulberry Bush}}"), runs to the bathroom to vomit.\
Martha goes to the kitchen to make coffee, and George and Nick go outside. The younger man confesses he was attracted to Honey more for her family's money than passion, and married her only because he mistakenly believed she was pregnant. George describes his own marriage as one of never-ending accommodation and adjustment, then admits he considers Nick a threat. George also tells a story about a boy he grew up with who had accidentally killed his mother and years later, his father, and ended up living out his days in a mental hospital. Nick admits he aims to charm and sleep his way to the top, and jokes that Martha would be a good place to start.\
When their guests propose leaving, George insists on driving them home, despite his inebriated state. They approach a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Roadhouse_(facility)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 roadhouse}}, and Honey suggests they stop to dance. While Honey and George watch, Nick suggestively dances with Martha, who continues to mock and criticize George. George unplugs the jukebox and announces the game is over. In response, Martha alludes to the fact he may have murdered his parents like the protagonist in his unpublished,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Non-fiction_novel"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 non-fiction novel}}, prompting George to attack Martha until Nick pulls him away from her. George tells the group about a second novel he allegedly has written about a young couple from the Midwest, a good-looking teacher and his timid wife, who marry because of her\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/False_pregnancy"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 hysterical pregnancy}}\'a0and money, then settle in a small college town. An embarrassed Honey realizes Nick indiscreetly told George about their past and runs from the room. Nick promises revenge on George, and then runs after Honey.\
In the parking lot, George tells his wife he cannot stand the way she constantly humiliates him, and she tauntingly accuses him of having married her for just that reason. Their rage erupts into a declaration of "total war". Martha drives off, retrieving Nick and Honey, leaving George to make his way back home on foot. When he arrives home, he discovers the car crashed on the drive and Honey half conscious on the back seat and sees Martha and Nick together through the bedroom window. Through Honey's drunken babbling, George begins to suspect that her pregnancy was in fact real, and that she secretly had an\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Abortion"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 abortion}}. He then devises a plan to get back at Martha.\
When Martha accuses Nick of being sexually inadequate, he blames his lack of performance on all the liquor he has consumed. George then appears holding snapdragons, which he throws at Martha and Nick in another game. He mentions his and Martha's son, prompting her to reminisce about his birth and childhood and how he was nearly destroyed by his father. George accuses Martha of engaging in destructive and abusive behavior with the boy, who frequently ran away to escape her attention. George then announces he has received a telegram with bad news\'97their son has been killed in a car accident.\
As Martha begs George not to "kill" their son, Nick suddenly realizes the truth: Martha and George had never been able to have children, and filled the void with an imaginary son. By declaring their son dead, accordingly, George has "killed" him. George explains that their one mutually-agreed-upon rule was to never mention the "existence" of their son to anyone else, and that he "killed" him because Martha broke that rule by mentioning him to Honey.\
The young couple departs quietly, and George and Martha are left alone as the day begins to break outside. George starts singing the song "Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf?", and Martha responds, "I am, George, I am."\

King Louie offers to help Mowgli stay in the jungle if he will tell Louie how to make fire like other humans. However, since he was not raised by humans, Mowgli does not know how to make fire. Bagheera and Baloo arrive to rescue Mowgli and in the ensuing chaos, King Louie's palace is demolished to rubble. Bagheera speaks to Baloo that night and convinces him that the jungle will never be safe for Mowgli so long as Shere Khan is there. In the morning, Baloo reluctantly explains to Mowgli that the Man-Village is best for the boy, but Mowgli accuses him of breaking his promise and runs away. As Baloo sets off in search of Mowgli, Bagheera rallies the help of Hathi and his patrol. However, Shere Khan himself, who was eavesdropping on Bagheera and Hathi's conversation, is now determined to hunt and kill Mowgli himself.\

Bagheera and Baloo take Mowgli to the edge of the Man-Village, but Mowgli is still hesitant to go there.

Mowgli retrieves it for her and follows her into the Man-Village. After Mowgli chooses to stay in the Man-Village, Baloo and Bagheera decide to head home, content that Mowgli is safe and happy with his own kind.\

Benjamin, visibly uncomfortable as his parents deliver accolades and neighborhood friends ask him about his future plans, evades those who try to congratulate him. Mrs. Robinson, the wife of his father's law partner, insists that he drive her home. Benjamin is coerced inside to have a drink and Mrs. Robinson attempts to seduce him. She invites him up to her daughter Elaine's room to see her portrait and then enters the room naked, making it clear that she is available to him. Benjamin initially rebuffs her but a few days later, he clumsily organizes a tryst at the Taft hotel.\
Benjamin spends the remainder of the summer drifting around in the pool by day, purposefully neglecting to select a graduate school, and seeing Mrs. Robinson at the hotel by night. He discovers that he and Mrs. Robinson have nothing to talk about. However, after Benjamin pesters her one evening, Mrs. Robinson reveals that she entered into a loveless marriage when she accidentally became pregnant with Elaine. Both Mr. Robinson and Benjamin's parents encourage him to call Elaine, but, in private, Mrs. Robinson forbids it.\
Benjamin takes Elaine on a date but tries to sabotage it by ignoring her, driving recklessly and taking her to a strip club. After Elaine runs out of the strip club in tears, Benjamin has a change of heart, realizes how rude he has been to her, and discovers that Elaine is someone with whom he is comfortable. In search of a late-night drink they visit the Taft hotel but when the staff greet Benjamin as "Mr. Gladstone" (the name he uses during his rendezvous with Mrs. Robinson) Elaine correctly guesses that he has been having an affair with a married woman and accepts his assurances that the affair is now over. To preempt a furious Mrs. Robinson, who threatens to tell Elaine her version of their affair, Benjamin tells Elaine that the married woman was her mother. Elaine is distraught and returns to\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Berkeley,_California"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Berkeley}}. Benjamin pursues her there and tries to talk to her. She reveals that her mother's story is that he raped her while she was drunk, and refuses to believe that her mother actually seduced Benjamin. After pestering her to marry him for several days, Benjamin begins to make inroads with Elaine. However, Mr. Robinson arrives at Berkeley after learning about the affair, confronts Benjamin at his rooming house, and threatens to put him behind bars if Benjamin sees his daughter again. Mr. Robinson then forces Elaine to drop out of college and takes her away to marry Carl, a classmate with whom she had briefly been involved.\
Returning to Pasadena in search of Elaine, Benjamin breaks into the Robinson home but encounters Mrs. Robinson. She tells him he will not be able to stop the wedding and then calls the police claiming that her house is being burgled.

He rushes to the church and arrives just as Elaine is married. He bangs on the glass at the back of the church and screams out "Elaine!" repeatedly. After a brief hesitation, Elaine screams out "Ben!" and starts to run toward him. A brawl ensues as guests try to stop Elaine and Benjamin from leaving together. Elaine manages to break free from her mother, who then slaps her. Benjamin manages to keep the guests at bay by jamming a large cross into the doors of the church. Both he and Elaine then run into the street to flag down a passing bus and take the back seat. Although initially elated at their victory, the pair become increasingly uncomfortable as they journey towards an uncertain future.\

Bowman takes another pod to rescue Poole.\
Meanwhile, Hal turns off the life support functions of the crewmen in suspended animation. When Bowman returns to the ship with Poole's body, Hal refuses to let him in, stating that the astronauts' plan to deactivate him jeopardizes the mission. Bowman opens the ship's emergency airlock manually, enters the ship, and proceeds to Hal's processor core. Hal tries to reassure Bowman, then pleads with him to stop, and finally expresses fear. As Bowman gradually deactivates the circuits controlling Hal's higher intellectual functions, Hal regresses to his earliest programmed memory, the song "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Daisy_Bell"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Daisy Bell}}", which he sings for Bowman. When Bowman disconnects Hal, a prerecorded video message from Floyd plays, revealing that the mission's true objective is to investigate a radio signal, sent from a lunar artifact (the monolith) to Jupiter. Only Hal and the hibernating crew had been told this.\
At Jupiter, Bowman leaves\'a0

He sees, and then becomes, older versions of himself, first standing in the bedroom, middle-aged and still in his spacesuit, then dressed in leisure attire and eating dinner, and finally as an old man lying in the bed.

To pay for Jenny's cancer therapy, Oliver seeks money from his estranged father, who asks him if he has "gotten a girl in trouble." Oliver simply says yes, and his father writes a cheque.\
From her hospital bed, Jenny makes funeral arrangements with her father, then asks for Oliver.

Eventually Mel orders the plane to be pushed off the runway by snowplows, despite the costly damage they would do to it.

Charnier soon realizes he has been observed since his arrival in New York. He "makes" Popeye and escapes, waving tauntingly on the departing subway shuttle. To avoid being tailed, he has Sal Boca instead meet him in Washington D.C., where Boca asks for a delay to avoid the police. Charnier, however, wants to conclude the deal quickly so he can return to France. On the flight back to New York, Nicoli offers to kill Popeye, but Charnier objects, knowing that Popeye would be replaced by another policeman. Nicoli insists, however, saying they will be back in France before a replacement is assigned.\
Soon after, Nicoli attempts to shoot Popeye from the roof of Doyle's apartment complex but misses. Popeye chases Nicoli, who boards an elevated train at the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Bay_50th_Street_(BMT_West_End_Line)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Bay 50th Street Station}}\'a0in Gravesend. Doyle commandeers a car and gives chase along Stillwell Avenue. Realizing he is being pursued, Nicoli works his way forward through the carriages, shoots a policeman who tries to intervene and then hijacks the motorman at gunpoint forcing him to drive straight through the next station, also shooting the train conductor who gets too close. The motorman passes out and they are just about to slam into another, stationary, train, when an emergency trackside brake engages violently hurling the assassin against a glass window. Popeye arrives limping, having wrecked the commandeered car, and sees the killer descending from the platform. When the killer sees Popeye, he turns to run but is shot dead by Popeye with a single shot.\
After a lengthy stakeout, Popeye impounds Devereaux's Lincoln. In a police garage, he and his team take it apart piece by piece, searching for the drugs, but seemingly come up empty-handed. Then Cloudy notes that the vehicle's shipping weight is 120 pounds over its listed manufacturer's weight; they realize the contraband must still be in the car. This time they remove the rocker panels and discover the obloid packages of heroin concealed therein. The police then restore the car to its original condition and return it to Devereaux, who delivers the Lincoln to Charnier.\
Charnier drives to an old factory on\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Wards_Island"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Wards Island}}\'a0to meet Weinstock and about a dozen others, and deliver the drugs. After Charnier has the rocker panels removed, Weinstock's chemist tests one of the bags and confirms its quality. Charnier removes the bags of drugs and hides the money, concealing it beneath the rocker panels of another car that was purchased at an auction of junk cars, which he will then take back to France. With their transaction complete, Charnier and Sal drive off in the Lincoln, but almost immediately hit a roadblock with a large contingent of police led by Popeye Doyle, who playfully waves to Charnier. The police chase the Lincoln back to the factory, where Sal is killed with two shotgun blasts during a shootout with the police and most of the other criminals surrender.\
Charnier, however, escapes into the old warehouse and Popeye follows after him, with Cloudy joining in the hunt. When Popeye sees a shadowy figure in the distance, he empties his revolver a split-second after shouting a warning. The man whom Popeye kills, however, is not Charnier but Mulderig. Undaunted, Popeye tells Cloudy that he will get Charnier. After reloading his gun, Popeye runs into another room, and a few seconds later, a single gunshot is heard.\
Title cards before the closing credits note that Joel Weinstock was indicted but had his case dismissed for "lack of proper evidence"; Angie Boca received a suspended sentence for an unspecified misdemeanor; Lou Boca received a reduced sentence; Devereaux served four years in a federal penitentiary for conspiracy; and Charnier was never caught. Popeye and Cloudy were transferred out of the narcotics division and reassigned.\

Tevye invites Perchik to stay with his family, offering him room and board in exchange for Perchik tutoring his daughters.\
Tevye arranges for his oldest daughter, Tzeitel, to marry Lazar Wolf, an older, and widowed, wealthy butcher. Tzeitel is in love with her childhood sweetheart, Motel Kamzoil, and begs her father not to make her marry Lazar Wolf. Although he is initially angry, Tevye realizes that Tzeitel loves Motel and yields to his daughter's demands.\
In order to convince his wife Golde that Tzeitel should not be married to Lazar Wolf, Tevye claims to have had a nightmare. He says that Golde's deceased grandmother told him Tzeitel is supposed to marry Motel, and that Lazar Wolf's late wife, Fruma-Sarah, threatened to kill Tzeitel if the two are married. Golde concludes that the dream was a message from their ancestors, and Tzeitel and Motel arrange to be married.\
Meanwhile, Tevye's second daughter, Hodel, and Perchik begin to fall in love. They argue over the story of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Leah"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Leah}}\'a0and the place of old religious traditions in a changing world. The two dance together, which is considered forbidden by Orthodox Jewish tradition. Perchik tells Hodel that they just changed an old tradition.\
At Tzeitel and Motel's wedding, an argument breaks out after Lazar Wolf presents the newlyweds with gifts. When Tevye tries to speak to Lazar about the Torah, Lazar refuses to listen, arguing that the wedding should have been his all along. Minutes later, another argument breaks out over whether a girl should be able to choose her own husband. Perchik addresses the crowd and says that, since they love each other, it should be left for the couple to decide. He creates further controversy by asking Hodel to dance with him.\
The crowd gradually warms to the idea and Tevye and Golde, then Motel and Tzeitel, join in dancing. The wedding proceeds with great joy. Suddenly, the military presence in the town and the constable arrive and begin a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Anti-Jewish_pogroms_in_the_Russian_Empire"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 pogrom}}, the "demonstration" which he had earlier warned Tevye was coming. The constable stops the attack on the wedding celebration after Perchik is wounded in the scuffle with the tsar's men; however, he allows the men to continue destroying property in the village. Tevye and the immediate family stand still, until Tevye angrily orders them to clean up instead of standing around. Tevye silently asks why God allowed this to happen to them.\

He proposes to Hodel, and she accepts. When they tell Tevye, he is furious that they have decided to marry without his permission, but he again relents because they love each other. Tevye tells Golde his reasons for consenting to their daughter's marriage, which leads them to re-evaluate their own arranged marriage. Tevye and Golde ultimately realize that, despite having been paired by a matchmaker, they do love each other.\

Meanwhile, Tzeitel and Motel become parents, and Motel finally buys the sewing machine for which he has long scrimped and saved.\
Tevye's third daughter Chava falls in love with a Russian Orthodox Christian named Fyedka. Tevye tells Chava to be distant friends with Fyedka, because of the difference in their religions. When Chava eventually works up the courage to ask Tevye's permission to marry Fyedka, Tevye tells her that marrying outside the family's faith is against tradition. He forbids her from having any contact with Fyedka or from even mentioning his name. The next morning, Fyedka and Chava elope and are married in a Russian Orthodox church.\
Golde learns of the marriage when she meets up with the priest. When a grief-stricken Golde tells Tevye about the marriage, he tells her that Chava is dead to the family and that they shall forget her altogether. Chava asks Tevye to accept her marriage.

One winter day, the Jews of Anatevka are notified that they have three days to leave the village or be forced out by the government.

Lazar Wolf plans to emigrate to Chicago, to live with his former brother in law, whom he detests, but "a relative is a relative". Lazar and Tevye share one last embrace before departing.\
Tevye receives letters from Hodel mentioning that she is working hard while Perchik stays in the Siberian prison. It is hoped that when Perchik is released, they will join the others in the United States.

The Constable silently watches as the mass evacuation of Anatevka takes place. The community forms their circle at a crossroad one last time before scattering in different directions.

Tiffany reneges on her deal to meet back with Bond and instead flees, passing off the diamonds to the next smuggler.

Bond escapes and calls Blofeld, using a similar electronic device made by Q to pose as Saxby. He finds out Whyte is kept at his summer house outside the city and goes there with Felix and the CIA. After a brief battle with Whyte's female bodyguards Bambi and Thumper, they rescue Whyte. Saxby attempts to kill Bond outside the summer house, but is fatally shot during the ensuing gunfight. In the meantime, Blofeld abducts Case.

He assures the Five Families that he will withdraw his opposition to their heroin business and forgo avenging Sonny's murder.

Kay gives birth to two children by the early 1950s, and with his father at the end of his career and his brother too weak, Michael takes the family reins. He insists Hagen relocate to Las Vegas and relinquish his role to Vito because Tom is not a "wartime consigliere"; Vito agrees Tom should "have no part in what will happen" in the coming battles with rival families. Michael travels to Las Vegas to buy out Greene's stake in the family's casinos. Michael is dismayed to see that Fredo has fallen under Greene's sway.\

Chris hosts a party, during which Regan comes downstairs unannounced, tells one of the guests\'97an astronaut\'97that he will die in space and then urinates on the floor. Later, Regan's bed begins to shake violently, adding further to her mother's horror. Chris consults a number of physicians, but Dr. Klein and his associates find nothing physiologically wrong with her daughter, despite Regan undergoing a battery of diagnostic tests.\
One night when Chris is out, Burke Dennings is babysitting a heavily sedated Regan. Chris returns to hear he has died falling out the window. Although this is assumed to have been an accident given Burke's history of heavy drinking, his death is investigated by Lieutenant William Kinderman. Kinderman interviews Chris. He also consults psychiatrist Father Damien Karras, recently shaken after the death of his frail mother.\
The doctors, thinking that Regan's aberrations are mostly psychiatric in origin, recommend an exorcism be performed. Chris arranges a meeting with Karras. After Regan speaks backwards in different voices and exhibits scars in the form of the words "Help Me" on her stomach, Karras is convinced that Regan is possessed. Believing her soul is in danger, he decides to perform an exorcism. The experienced Merrin is selected for performing the actual exorcism with Karras assisting.\
Both priests witness Regan perform a series of bizarre, vulgar acts. They attempt to exorcise the demon, but the stubborn entity toys with them, especially Karras. Karras shows weakness and is dismissed by Merrin, who attempts the exorcism alone. Karras enters the room later and discovers Merrin has died of a heart attack. After failing to revive Merrin, the enraged Karras confronts the mocking, laughing spirit, and wrestles Regan's body to the ground. At Karras's invitation, it leaves Regan's body and possesses Karras. In a moment of self-sacrifice, the priest throws himself out of the window before being compelled to harm Regan. He is mortally injured. Father Dyer, an old friend of Karras, happens upon the scene and administers the last rites to his friend.\
A few days later, Regan, now back to her normal self, prepares to leave for Los Angeles with her mother. Although Regan has no apparent recollection of her possession, she is moved by the sight of Dyer's clerical collar to kiss him on the cheek. Kinderman, who narrowly misses their departure, befriends Father Dyer as he investigates Karras' death.\

Corrupt Joliet police Lieutenant William Snyder confronts Hooker, revealing Lonnegan's involvement and demanding part of Hooker's cut.

Shaw infuriates Lonnegan with his obnoxious behavior, then outcheats him to win $15,000.

Kelly reveals that he has a partner named Les Harmon (actually con man Kid Twist) in the Chicago\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Western_Union"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Western Union}}\'a0office, who will allow them to win bets on horse races by\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Past-posting"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 past-posting}}.\
Meanwhile, Snyder has tracked Hooker to Chicago, but his pursuit is thwarted when he is summoned by undercover FBI agents led by Agent Polk, who orders him to assist in their plan to arrest Gondorff using Hooker. At the same time, Lonnegan has grown frustrated with the inability of his men to find and kill Hooker for the Joliet con. Unaware that Kelly is Hooker, he demands that Salino, his best assassin, be given the job. A mysterious figure with black leather gloves is then seen following and observing Hooker.\
Kelly's connection appears effective, as Harmon provides Lonnegan with the winner of one horse race and the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Trifecta"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 trifecta}}\'a0of another. Lonnegan agrees to finance a $500,000 bet at Shaw's parlor to break Shaw and gain revenge. Shortly thereafter, Snyder captures Hooker and brings him before FBI Agent Polk. Polk forces Hooker to betray Gondorff by threatening to incarcerate Luther Coleman's widow.\
The night before the sting, Hooker sleeps with Loretta, a waitress from a local restaurant. As Hooker leaves the building the next morning, he sees Loretta walking toward him. The black-gloved man appears behind Hooker and shoots her dead \'96 she was Lonnegan's hired killer, Loretta Salino, and the gunman was hired by Gondorff to protect Hooker.\
Armed with Harmon's tip to "place it on Lucky Dan", Lonnegan makes the $500,000 bet at Shaw's parlor on Lucky Dan to win. As the race begins, Harmon arrives and expresses shock at Lonnegan's bet, explaining that when he said "place it" he meant, literally, that Lucky Dan would "place" (i.e.,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Across_the_board"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 finish\'a0

Polk confronts Gondorff, then tells Hooker he is free to go. Gondorff, reacting to the betrayal, shoots Hooker in the back. Polk then shoots Gondorff and orders Snyder to get the ostensibly-respectable Lonnegan away from the crime scene. With Lonnegan and Snyder safely away, Hooker and Gondorff rise amid cheers and laughter. Agent Polk is actually Hickey, a con man, running a con atop Gondorff's con to divert Snyder and provide a solid "blow off". As the con men strip the room of its contents, Hooker refuses his share of the money, saying "I'd only blow it", and walks away with Gondorff.\

Roberts suspects that Roger Simmons, the electrical subcontractor and also Duncan's son-in-law, cut corners. Roberts confronts Simmons, who reveals nothing.\
During the dedication ceremony, at which Duncan is also trying to court US Senator Gary Parker in pursuit of a lucrative urban renewal contract, chief of Public Relations Dan Bigelow turns on all the tower's lights, but Roberts orders them shut off to reduce the load on the electrical system. Smoke is seen on the 81st floor, and the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/San_Francisco_Fire_Department"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 San Francisco Fire Department}}\'a0(SFFD) is summoned.

Fire overtakes the express elevators, killing a group whose elevator stops on the engulfed 81st floor.

An explosion near the 110th floor throws Lisolette from the elevator and leaves the elevator hanging by a single cable, but O\'92Halloran rescues the elevator with a Navy helicopter.\
As fire reaches the Promenade Room, a group of men led by Simmons attempts to commandeer the breeches buoy, which is subsequently destroyed in an explosion, killing Simmons, Parker and several other men. In a last-ditch strategy, O'Halloran and Roberts blow up water tanks atop the Tower with\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Plastic_explosive"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 plastic explosives}}.

After an initial hostile reception (where Sheriff Bart has to take himself hostage to escape), he relies on his quick wits and the assistance of Jim, an alcoholic gunslinger known as the "Waco Kid", to overcome the townspeople's hostility. He subdues Mongo, an immensely strong, dim-witted, but philosophical henchman sent to kill him; when he visits the railroad work site and discovers their interest in the land, the Waco Kid outshoots Taggart and his thugs; finally, Bart outmaneuvers German seductress-for-hire Lili von Sht\'fcpp at her own game, with Lili falling in love with him. Lamarr, furious that his schemes have backfired, hatches a larger plan involving a recruited army of thugs, including common criminals,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Ku_Klux_Klan"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Ku Klux Klansmen}}, Nazis, and\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Methodism"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Methodists}}.\
Three miles east of Rock Ridge, Bart introduces the white townspeople to the black, Chinese, and Irish railroad workers, who have agreed to help in exchange for acceptance by the community, and explains his plan to defeat Lamarr's army. They labor all night to build a perfect replica of their town, as a diversion; with no people in it, though, Bart realizes it will not fool the villains. While the townspeople construct replicas of themselves, Bart, Jim, and Mongo buy time by constructing the "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/New_York_State_Thruway"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Gov.

Once through the tollbooth, the raiders attack the fake town populated with dummies, which are booby-trapped with dynamite bombs. After Jim detonates the bombs with his sharpshooting, launching bad guys and horses skyward, the Rock Ridgers storm the villains.\

Riding out of town, he finds Jim, and invites him along to "nowhere special".

Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly thereafter. A bounty is placed on the shark, prompting an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, and confirms her death was caused by a shark\'97an unusually large one.\

Underwater, Hooper retrieves a sizable\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Great_white_shark"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 great white shark}}'s tooth embedded in the submerged hull. He drops it in fright after encountering a partial corpse. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's claims that a huge great white shark is responsible for the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank in which the presence of a shark is simulated, the real shark enters a nearby\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Estuary"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 estuary}}, killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces Vaughn to hire Quint.\
Quint, Brody, and Hooper set out on Quint's boat, the\'a0

While Brody lays down a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Chumming"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 chum}}\'a0line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating its length at 25 feet (7.6\'a0m) and weight at 3 tons, harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.\
At nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars and Quint reveals that he survived the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 USS\'a0

In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he intentionally pushes the damaged engine past the safety limits and the overtaxed engine fails.\

The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly and devours Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody jams a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion obliterates the shark. Hooper surfaces, and he and Brody paddle back to Amity Island clinging to the remaining barrels.\

Taking advantage of his overconfidence, Rocky knocks him down in the first round\'97the first time that Creed has ever been knocked down. Humiliated, Creed takes Rocky more seriously for the rest of the fight, though his ego never fully fades. The fight goes on for the full fifteen rounds, with both combatants sustaining various injuries, Rocky with a detached retina in his right eye and hits to the head, and Apollo with internal bleeding and a broken rib. As the fight progresses, Creed's superior skill is countered by Rocky's apparently unlimited ability to absorb punches, and his dogged refusal to go down. As the final round bell sounds, with both fighters locked in each other's arms, they promise to each other that there will be no rematch.\
After the fight, the sportscasters and the audience go wild. Jergens announces over the loudspeaker that the fight was "the greatest exhibition of guts and stamina in the history of the ring", and Rocky calls out repeatedly for Adrian, who runs down and comes into the ring as Paulie distracts arena security. As Jergens declares Creed the winner by virtue of a split decision (8:7, 7:8, 9:6), Adrian and Rocky embrace and profess their love to each other, not caring about the result of the fight.\

In the summer of 1958,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Greaser_(subculture)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 greaser}}\'a0Danny Zuko and sweet Australian girl Sandy Olsson meet at the beach and fall in love. When the summer comes to an end, Sandy, whose family is returning to Australia, worries that they might never meet again, but Danny tells her that their love is "only the beginning." At the beginning of the new school year at Rydell High School ("Grease"), Danny reunites with his fellow gang members, the T-Birds, of whom his best friend Kenickie, along with Doody, Sonny, and Putzie are members. Meanwhile, unbeknownst to Danny, Sandy arrives at school, with her family's plans having changed, with her new friend Frenchy, a member of the Pink Ladies. Other Pink Ladies Rizzo, Marty, and Jan also arrive, excited to be seniors, as does Patty Simcox, a high-achieving cheerleader.\
At lunch, Frenchy introduces Sandy to the other Pink Ladies while Danny and the T-Birds make fun of practicing football players, including the handsome Tom Chisum. Each group asks Danny and Sandy, respectively, about their summers and they each independently describe their romance without using the other's name, with Sandy's description far more innocent than Danny's ("Summer Nights"). Headed back to class, Sandy reveals that it was Danny Zuko she met, and Rizzo teases that perhaps she'll meet him again.\
At a pep rally before a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/American_football"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 football}}\'a0game, Sandy and Patty perform as cheerleaders; there, Sandy and Tom flirt. Kenickie arrives with a used car he plans on rebuilding so he can race it at Thunder Road, a popular\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Street_racing"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 street race}}spot; as he says this, Leo Balmudo, a rival greaser from the Scorpions, drives by in a menacing manner. Rizzo puts Sandy and Danny together, surprising both of them. Sandy is thrilled to see Danny, but he is obnoxious and indifferent, upsetting Sandy. Frenchy invites Sandy to a sleepover with the Pink Ladies to cheer her up.\
Rizzo and the other girls pressure Sandy into smoking a cigarette and having a drink of wine at the sleepover. Frenchy reveals that she plans to drop out of Rydell to go to beauty school and in an effort to prove herself, tries to pierce Sandy's ear, making Sandy sick. Rizzo makes fun of her innocent nature ("Look At Me, I'm Sandra Dee") and leaves when the T-Birds arrive in Kenickie's car. Rizzo tries to make Danny jealous by flirting with Kenickie, but Danny is unmoved and leaves. Kenickie leaves with Rizzo, stranding Putzie, Sonny, and Doody. Sandy laments over her feelings towards Danny, despite his earlier behavior ("Hopelessly Devoted to You").\
Kenickie and Rizzo, while in the midst of sex, are interrupted when Leo, along with his girlfriend Cha-Cha, deliberately crashes his own street racer into Kenickie's and insults Rizzo. At the same time, Kenickie's condom breaks.\
The next day, the T-Birds look over Kenickie's car, and although they are initially skeptical of its potential, Danny and Kenickie explain the modifications they could add to make it a hot-rodding sex machine ("Greased Lightnin'"). At the popular hangout The Frosty Palace, Danny, after brushing off an attempt by Patty to flirt with him, apologizes to Sandy for his behavior at the pep rally, but she rejects him having started dating Tom instead. Danny approaches Coach Calhoun about playing a sport.

Danny takes Sandy to the Frosty Palace for a date; they are soon joined by the rest of the greasers, and Danny and Sandy quickly leave in discomfort. Putzie and Jan, in an awkward exchange, agree to pair off for the dance; Kenickie and Rizzo get into an argument and go their separate ways, while Sonny unsuccessfully tries to court Marty. After everyone else has left, Frenchy, whose hair has turned bright pink, tells a waitress she has dropped out of beauty school and is visited by a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Guardian_angel"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 guardian angel}}\'a0who advises her to return to Rydell ("Beauty School Dropout").\
At the school dance, Leo and Cha-Cha show up as Rizzo's and Kenickie's respective dates. Vince Fontaine, who is hosting a live telecast of the dance, flirts with Marty. All of the students take part in a dance contest that descends into chaos ("Born to Hand Jive"). Danny and Sandy do well, but Sonny pulls Sandy off the dance floor, allowing Cha Cha to step in and win with Danny. During the last dance ("Blue Moon"), Sonny, Putzie, and Doody\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Mooning"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 moon}}\'a0the national TV audience.\
Danny apologizes to Sandy and tries to make it up to her by taking her to a drive-in movie theater. She's unmoved by his pleas for forgiveness until he asks her to wear his ring, which she gleefully accepts. Danny then tries to make out with her, causing Sandy to angrily throw his ring at him and run off in disgust, leaving Danny distraught ("Sandy"). Meanwhile, Rizzo admits she may be pregnant to Marty and asks her to keep it a secret, but the story gets back to Kenickie, and he tells Rizzo he doesn't run away from his mistakes. Rizzo tells Kenickie the baby isn't his, which both relieves and upsets him.\
The next day, the T-Birds have finished Kenickie's car and he is eager to race it against Leo's at Thunder Road. Sandy tells Rizzo she plans to watch the race and offers to help Rizzo despite the rumors about Rizzo's character that have been spread around school. She thanks Sandy and muses to herself about how her sins are not as bad as they could be ("There Are Worse Things I Could Do").\
The T-Birds, Pink Ladies, and Scorpions gather for the race, with the winner receiving the loser's car as a prize. Just before the race begins, Kenickie hits his head, and Danny takes the wheel. Despite Leo using bladed hub caps (in a sequence paying homage to\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Ben-Hur_(1959_film)"}}{\fldrslt

The gang celebrates graduation at a school carnival where Rizzo tells Kenickie she isn't pregnant and they reunite. Danny arrives wearing a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Letterman_(sports)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 letterman's}}\'a0sweater, to the other T-Birds' dismay. Sandy shocks everyone when she arrives with a new, wilder hairstyle and wearing a revealing black outfit and leather jacket. In song, Danny and Sandy reaffirm their commitment to each other ("You're the One That I Want"). As the film ends, the greasers promise to stay together after school ends ("We Go Together") and Danny and Sandy depart in a red hot rod, which takes flight as they wave goodbye to their friends.\

In a private moment, Rocky goes to see a recuperating Apollo, and wants a truthful response to his question of whether Apollo gave his all in the fight; Creed confirms that he did. After Rocky is released from the hospital, he enjoys the benefits of his life's changes: Rocky's new fame attracts an agent who sees Rocky as a potential endorsement and sponsorship goldmine, and his sudden wealth encourages him to propose to Adrian. She happily accepts, and they marry in a small ceremony. Soon after, Adrian reveals that she is pregnant.\
Meanwhile, fueled by hate mail, Apollo becomes obsessed with the idea that a rematch is the only way to prove that Rocky's performance was simply a fluke. Determined to rectify his boxing career's only blemish, Apollo ignores all pleas by his friends and family to forget the fight, and move on to other potential opponents, and instead demands his team do whatever necessary to goad Rocky out of retirement and have a rematch with him.\
Rocky, at first, seems unaffected by Apollo's smear campaign, but his inexperience with money causes him to run into financial problems. After several unsuccessful attempts to find employment, Rocky visits Mickey Goldmill, his trainer and manager, at his gym to talk about the possibility of returning to boxing. At first, Mickey declines, concerned about Rocky's health, but he soon accepts after Apollo publicly insults Rocky. Adrian confronts Rocky about the danger of returning to boxing and reminds him of the risk to his eyesight. Rocky argues that he knows nothing else, so this is the only way he can provide. Adrian, furious at Rocky for breaking his promise, refuses to support him.\
Rocky and Mickey begin training, but Rocky's mind is not fully set due to Adrian's disapproval. Adrian's brother, Paulie, confronts his sister about not supporting her husband, but she faints during the confrontation, and is rushed to the hospital, where she goes into labor. Despite being premature, the baby is healthy, but Adrian falls into a coma. Rocky blames himself for what happened, refusing to leave Adrian's bedside until she wakes up, and will not go to see his new baby until they can see it together. When Adrian comes out of her coma, she finds Rocky by her bedside, and the couple are shown their new baby, a boy, which they name Robert "Rocky Jr." Adrian gives her blessing to the rematch, and Rocky quickly gets into shape for the match.\
The night of the match arrives, and Apollo makes a public goal of beating Rocky in no more than two rounds to prove the first match going the full fifteen rounds was a fluke. Rocky, fighting right-handed to protect his eye instead of his natural\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Southpaw"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 southpaw}}, is knocked down twice by Creed and outclassed for much of the fight. As with their first fight, this match goes the full fifteen rounds, by which time Creed is well ahead on points and only needs to stay away from Balboa to win the fight by decision. However, Creed, not wanting the fight to end like it did the first time, ignores his trainer's pleas to stay back and attempts to beat Rocky by knockout. In the final round, Rocky switches back to his natural stance, and in dramatic fashion, unleashes a series of counter punches on Creed, turning the tide. Both men, exhausted, trade punches until they knock each other down. Apollo gets up on the ropes early while Rocky is on the canvas and has to make his way over. Rocky is able to will himself up on 9 while Apollo collapses from exhaustion, giving Rocky the win by knockout, making him the new heavyweight champion. Rocky then gives an impassioned speech to the crowd and holds the belt over his head with a message for his wife, who is watching the fight on TV: "Yo, Adrian, I did it!"\

That night, Elliott and E.T. head through the forest, where they make a successful call home. The next day, Elliott wakes up in the field, only to find E.T. gone. Elliott returns home to his distressed family. Michael searches for and finds E.T. dying next to a culvert. Michael takes E.T. home to Elliott, who is also dying. Mary becomes frightened when she discovers her son's illness and the dying alien, just as government agents invade the house. Scientists set up a hospital at the house, questioning Michael, Mary and Gertie while treating Elliott and E.T. Their connection disappears and E.T. then appears to die while Elliott recovers. A grief-stricken Elliott is left alone with the motionless E.T. when he notices a dead chrysanthemum, the plant E.T. had previously revived, coming back to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael's friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bicycles.

Standing near the spaceship, E.T.'s heart glows as he prepares to return home. Mary, Gertie, and "Keys", a friendly government agent, show up. E.T. says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, as she presents him with the chrysanthemum that he had revived. Before boarding the spaceship, he embraces Elliott and tells him "I'll be right here", pointing his glowing finger to Elliott's forehead. He then picks up the chrysanthemum, boards the spaceship, and it takes off, leaving a rainbow in the sky as everyone watches it leave.\

During the journey to Pankot, Indy hypothesizes that the stone may be one of the five fabled Sankara stones that promise fortune and glory.\

Later that night, Indy is attacked by an assassin, leading Indy, Willie, and Shorty to believe that something is amiss. After Indy kills the assassin, they discover a series of tunnels hidden behind a statue in Willie's room and set out to explore them, overcoming a number of booby-traps along the way.\
The trio eventually reach an underground temple where the Thugs worship\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Kali"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Kali}}\'a0with human sacrifice. They watch as the Thugs chain one of their victims in a cage and slowly lower him into a ceremonial lava pit, burning him alive. They discover that the Thugs, led by their high priest Mola Ram, are in possession of three of the five Sankara stones, and have enslaved the children to mine for the last two. As Indy tries to retrieve the stones, he, Willie, and Shorty are captured and separated.

Willie, meanwhile, is kept as a human sacrifice, while Shorty is whipped and put to work in the mines alongside the children. Shorty breaks free and escapes back into the temple where he burns Indy with a torch, bringing him back to his senses. After fighting off the guards and defeating Chattar Lal, Indy stops Willie's cage and cranks it out of the pit just in time to save her from the fire, while Mola Ram escapes. Indy retrieves the Sankara stones, and the three return to the mines to free the children. As Indy fights a hulking overseer, the Maharaja\'97also under Mola Ram's control\'97tries to cripple him with a voodoo doll. Shorty knocks the doll away and burns him to break the trance, and a restored Indy escapes and leaves the overseer to die in a rock crusher.\
The trio escape from the temple in a mine cart, pursued by Thugs, while Mola Ram orders a water cistern dumped in an attempt to flood them out. After barely escaping the deluge, they are again cornered by Mola Ram and his henchmen on a rope bridge high above a crocodile-infested river. Indy cuts the rope bridge in half with one man's sword, leaving everyone to hang on for their lives. As he and Mola Ram struggle over the stones, he invokes the name of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Shiva"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Shiva}}, causing them to glow white-hot.

When they realize that he has prevented his parents from meeting, Doc warns Marty that he must find a way to introduce George to Lorraine or he will be erased from existence. Doc formulates a plan to harness the power of the lightning, while Marty sets about introducing his parents.\
After Lorraine asks Marty to the school dance, Marty concocts a plan: he will feign inappropriate advances on Lorraine, allowing George to "rescue" her. The plan goes awry when a drunken Biff attempts to force himself on Lorraine. George, enraged, knocks out Biff, and Lorraine follows him to the dance floor, where they kiss while Marty performs with the band.\
As the storm arrives, Marty returns to the clock tower and the lightning strikes, sending Marty back to 1985.

At a bar the day before Topgun starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman.

Maverick also becomes a rival to top student LT Tom "Iceman" Kazansky, who considers Maverick's flying "dangerous." Charlie also objects to Maverick's aggressive tactics but eventually admits that she admires his flying and omitted it from her reports to hide her feelings for him, and the two begin a romantic relationship.\
During a training sortie, Maverick abandons his wingman "Hollywood" to chase Viper, but is defeated when Viper maneuvers Maverick into a position from which his wingman Jester can shoot down Maverick from behind, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual prowess.\
Maverick and Iceman, now direct competitors for the Topgun Trophy, chase an\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Douglas_A-4_Skyhawk"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 A-4}}\'a0in a later training engagement.

Although the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility for Goose's death, he is overcome by guilt and his flying skill diminishes.

Contrary to official reports which faulted Mitchell, Viper reveals classified information that proves Mitchell died heroically, and informs Maverick that he can succeed if he can regain his self-confidence. Maverick chooses to graduate, though Iceman wins the Top Gun Trophy.\
During the graduation party, Viper calls in the newly graduated aviators with the orders to deploy. Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately return to\'a0

Maverick and Merlin (Cougar's former RIO) are assigned as back-up for F-14s flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman's reservations over Maverick's state of mind. The subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs sees Hollywood shot down; Maverick is scrambled alone due to a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Aircraft_catapult"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 catapult}}\'a0failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose's death.

Offered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to Topgun as an instructor. At a bar in Miramar, Maverick and Charlie reunite.\

While his wife, Beth, and daughter, Ellen, are out of town for the weekend, Dan has an affair with Alex. Though it was initially understood by both as just a fling, Alex starts clinging to him.\
Dan spends a second unplanned evening with Alex after she persistently asks him over. When Dan tries to leave, she cuts her wrists in a suicide attempt. He helps her bandage the cuts and then leaves. He thinks the affair is forgotten, but she shows up at various places to see him. She waits at his office one day to apologize and invites him to a performance of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Madame_Butterfly"}}{\fldrslt

Alex then phones his home at all hours, claiming that she is pregnant and plans to keep the baby. Although he wants nothing to do with her, she argues that he must take responsibility. After he changes his home phone number, she shows up at his apartment (which is for sale) and meets Beth, feigning interest as a buyer. Later that night, Dan goes to Alex's apartment to confront her, which results in a scuffle. In response, she replies that she will not be ignored.\
Dan moves his family to\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Bedford_(town),_New_York"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Bedford}}, but this does not deter Alex. She has a tape recording delivered to him filled with verbal abuse. She stalks him in a parking garage, pours acid on his car, and follows him home one night to spy on him, Beth, and Ellen from the bushes in their yard; the sight of their content family literally makes her sick to her stomach. Her obsession escalates further when Dan approaches the police to apply for a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Restraining_order"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 restraining order}}\'a0against Alex (claiming that it is "for a client").

At one point, while the Gallaghers are not home, Alex kills Ellen's pet rabbit, and puts it on their stove to boil. After this, Dan tells Beth of the affair and Alex's supposed pregnancy. Enraged, she demands that Dan leave. Before he goes, Dan calls Alex to tell her that Beth knows about the affair. Beth gets on the phone and warns Alex that she will kill her if she persists. Without Dan and Beth's knowledge, Alex picks up Ellen from school and takes her to an amusement park. Beth panics when she realizes that she does not know where Ellen is. She drives around frantically searching and rear-ends a car stopped at an intersection. Beth gets injured and is then hospitalized. Alex later takes Ellen home, asking her for a kiss on the cheek. Following Beth's release from the hospital, she forgives Dan and they return home.\
Dan barges into Alex's apartment and attacks her, choking her and coming close to strangling her. He stops himself, but as he does, she lunges at him with a kitchen knife. He overpowers her but decides to put the knife down and leave, while Alex is leaning against the kitchen counter, smiling. The police begin to search for her after Dan confronts them about having her arrested.\
Beth prepares a bath for herself when Alex suddenly appears, again with the kitchen knife. She starts to explain her resentment of Beth, nervously fidgeting (which causes Alex to cut her own leg) and then attacks Beth. Dan hears the screaming, rushes in, wrestles Alex into the bathtub, and seemingly drowns her. She suddenly emerges from the water, swinging the knife. Beth, who went searching for Dan's gun, shoots Alex in the chest, killing her. The final scene shows police cars outside the Gallaghers' house. As Dan finishes delivering his statement to the police, he walks inside, where Beth is waiting for him. They embrace and proceed to the living room as the camera focuses on a picture of them and Ellen.\

Charlie decides to attempt to gain custody of his brother in order to get control of the money.\

Indy pursues the tank on horseback and, with the aid of Sallah, saves Henry and Marcus.

Indy, Henry, Marcus, and Sallah catch up with the surviving Nazis, led by Donovan and Elsa, who have found the temple where the Holy Grail is kept but are unable to pass through the three protective booby traps. Donovan shoots and mortally wounds Henry in order to force Indy to risk his life in the traps to find the Grail and use its healing power to save him. Using the information in the diary and followed by Donovan and Elsa, Indy safely overcomes the traps and reaches the Grail's chamber, which is guarded by a knight. He has been kept alive for 700 years by the power of the Grail, which is hidden among dozens of false grails; only the true Grail brings life, while a false one claims it. Elsa purposefully selects a golden chalice studded with emeralds for Donovan, who ages into dust after drinking from it, proving it to be false. Indy selects a simple wooden cup, and the knight tells him that he has "chosen wisely," but warns that the Holy Grail cannot be taken beyond the temple's entrance. Indy fills the Grail with\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Holy_water"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 holy water}}\'a0and gives it to Henry, healing him instantly. Disregarding the knight's warning, Elsa takes the Grail and attempts to leave with it. The temple begins to collapse and after the Grail drops into a chasm, Elsa falls to her death trying to recover it. Indy nearly suffers the same fate before Henry persuades him to leave it. The Joneses, Marcus, and Sallah escape the temple and ride off into the sunset.\

Molly remains distraught in the days after Sam's death, as Sam remains close to her. Carl comes over and suggests Molly take a walk with him and Sam cannot bring himself to follow.

As Carl desperately searches for the money, Sam reveals his presence by typing his name on the computer keyboard. Carl goes to Molly, who reveals she spotted Oda Mae closing an account at the bank. Carl and Willie go to Oda Mae's place but Sam warns her and her sisters to take shelter. When Willie arrives, Sam tosses objects at him, who flees into the street in a fit of panic and is killed by an oncoming car.

Carl breaks into the apartment but Sam is too exhausted from the possession to fight Carl. The women run onto the fire escape, to a loft under construction, but Carl catches Oda Mae and holds her at gunpoint, demanding the check. A recovered Sam pushes Carl off her so Carl takes Molly hostage, pleading with Sam for the check. Sam disarms Carl and attacks him again. Carl tries to escape through a window and tosses a suspended hook at Sam, but the hook swings back, shatters the window and it slides down, fatally impaling and killing Carl with a glass shard. The shadowy creatures return to claim Carl's ghost for Hell.\
Sam asks if the women are all right. Miraculously, Molly can now hear him. A heavenly light shines in the room, illuminating Sam's presence.

After the trio escapes from the T-1000 in a police car, the Terminator informs John and Sarah about Skynet's history.

Unaware to touch nothing but the lamp, Abu grabs a red jewel, and the cave collapses.

The Genie tells Aladdin that he will grant him three wishes. Aladdin tricks the Genie into freeing themselves from the cave without using a wish, and he uses his first to become "Prince Ali Ababwa" in order to woo Jasmine.\
At Iago's suggestion, Jafar plots to become Sultan by marrying Jasmine. When Aladdin greets Jafar and the Sultan at the palace, Jasmine becomes angry at them. Refusing to tell Jasmine the truth, Aladdin takes Jasmine on a flight on the magic carpet. When she deduces his identity, he convinces her that he dresses as a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Peasant"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 peasant}}\'a0to escape the stresses of royal life. After sending Jasmine home, Aladdin is tied up, gagged and thrown into the sea by Jafar, but he is rescued from drowning by the Genie with his second wish. Jafar tries to hypnotize the Sultan into agreeing to his marriage to Jasmine, but Aladdin intervenes, exposing his evil plot in the process; however, Jafar spots the lamp and thus discovers Aladdin's true identity. He flees to his lair, and orders Iago to retrieve the lamp from Aladdin.\
Fearing that he will lose Jasmine if the truth is revealed, Aladdin refuses to free the Genie in order to maintain his charade. Iago steals the lamp, and Jafar becomes the Genie's new master. He uses his first two wishes to usurp the Sultan, and become the world's most powerful sorcerer, exposing Aladdin's identity and exiling him, Abu, and the carpet to a frozen wasteland. However, they escape, and return to the palace, where Jafar tries to use his final wish to make Jasmine fall in love with him, but the Genie cannot grant the wish as it is beyond his power. Upon noticing Aladdin, Jasmine pretends the wish has been granted to distract Jafar, and Aladdin attempts to retrieve the lamp.

After Aladdin rescues Jasmine out of the hourglass, he tricks Jafar into using his last wish to become an all-powerful genie; now bound to his new lamp, Jafar ends up trapped inside it, taking Iago with him.\
With the palace and kingdom returned to normal, the Genie transports Jafar's lamp to the Cave of Wonders, and advises Aladdin use his third wish to regain his royal title so the law will allow him to stay with Jasmine. Realizing that he has to be himself, Aladdin decides to keep his promise and frees the Genie. Realizing Aladdin and Jasmine's love, the Sultan changes the law to allow Jasmine to marry whom she chooses. The Genie leaves to explore the world, while Aladdin and Jasmine start their new life together.\

He informs Mufasa of Simba's peril, knowing that king will rush to save his son. Mufasa saves Simba but ends up hanging perilously from the gorge's edge. Scar refuses to help Mufasa, instead sending him falling to his death. He then convinces Simba that the tragedy was Simba's own fault and advises him to leave the kingdom. He then orders the hyenas to kill the cub, but Simba escapes. Scar tells the pride that both Mufasa and Simba were killed in the stampede and steps forward as the new king, allowing his three hyena minions and the rest of their large pack to live in the Pride Lands.\

Now a young adult, Simba rescues Timon and Pumbaa from a hungry lioness, who turns out to be Nala. She and Simba reunite and fall in love, and she urges him to return home, telling him the Pride Lands have become a drought-stricken wasteland under Scar's reign. Feeling guilty over his father's death, Simba refuses and storms off. He encounters Rafiki, who tells him that Mufasa's spirit lives on in Simba. Simba is visited by the ghost of Mufasa in the night sky, who tells him he must take his rightful place as king. Realizing that he can no longer run from his past, Simba decides to return to the Pride Lands.\
Aided by his friends, Simba sneaks past the hyenas at Pride Rock and confronts Scar, who had just struck Sarabi. Scar taunts Simba over his role in Mufasa's death and backs him to the edge of the rock, where he reveals to him that he murdered Mufasa. Enraged, Simba pins Scar to the ground and forces him to reveal the truth to the rest of the pride. Timon, Pumbaa, Rafiki, Zazu, and the lionesses fend off the hyenas while Scar, attempting to escape, is cornered by Simba at the top of Pride Rock. Scar begs for mercy and attempts to blame the hyenas for his actions; Simba spares his life, but orders him to leave the Pride Lands forever. Scar attacks his nephew, but Simba manages to toss him from the top of the rock. Scar survives the fall, but is attacked and killed by the hyenas, who overheard his attempt to betray them. Afterwards, Simba takes over the kingship as rain begins to fall.\
Later, with Pride Rock restored to its usual state, Rafiki presents Simba and Nala's newborn cub to the assembled animals, continuing the circle of life.\
In a world where toys are living things but pretend to be lifeless when humans are present, a group of toys, owned by a boy named Andy Davis, are caught off-guard when Andy's birthday party is moved up a week, as his family (including his mother and infant sister Molly) is preparing to move the following week.

The toys are relieved when the party appears to end with none of them being replaced by new toys, but then Andy receives a surprise gift \'96 a Buzz Lightyear action figure, who thinks he is a real space ranger.\
Buzz impresses the other toys with his various features, and Andy begins to favor him, making Woody feel abandoned. As Andy prepares for a family outing at Pizza Planet, his mother allows him to bring one toy. Fearing Andy will choose Buzz, Woody attempts to trap him behind a desk, but ends up accidentally knocking him out of a window. The other toys, except Bo Peep and Slinky, rebel against Woody, believing he did harm to Buzz out of jealousy. Before they can exact revenge, Andy takes Woody and leaves for Pizza Planet. When the family stops for gas, Woody finds that Buzz has hitched a ride on their van. They have a fight, only to find the family has left without them. They manage to make their way to the restaurant by stowing away on a pizza delivery truck. Buzz, still thinking he is a real space ranger, despite Woody's attempts to convince him otherwise, gets them stuck in a crane game, where they are won by Andy's toy-abusing neighbor, a boy named Sid Phillips.\
Woody attempts to escape from Sid's house, but Buzz, finally realizing he is a toy after watching a Buzz Lightyear TV ad and trying and failing to fly out a window, sinks into despondency. Sid plans to launch Buzz on a fireworks rocket, but his plans are delayed by a thunderstorm. Woody tells Buzz about the joy he can bring to Andy as a toy, restoring his confidence. The next day, Woody and Sid's mutant creature toys rescue Buzz just as Sid is about to launch the rocket and scare Sid into no longer abusing toys, and he runs into his house screaming in horror. Woody and Buzz leave just as Andy and his family drive away toward their new home.\
The duo tries to make it to the moving truck, but Sid's dog, Scud, sees them and gives chase. Buzz gets left behind while saving Woody from Scud, and Woody tries rescuing him with Andy's radio-controlled car (RC). Thinking that Woody is trying to eliminate RC as well, the other toys attack and toss him off the truck. Having evaded Scud, Buzz and RC retrieve Woody and continue to chase the truck. Upon seeing Woody and Buzz together on RC, the other toys realize their mistake and try to help them get back aboard, but RC's batteries become depleted, stranding them. Woody ignites the rocket on Buzz's back and manages to throw RC into the truck before they soar into the air. Buzz opens his wings to free himself from the rocket before it explodes, gliding with Woody to land safely into a box in the van, right next to Andy.\
On Christmas Day, at their new house, Woody and Buzz stage another reconnaissance mission to prepare for the new toy arrivals. One of the toys is Mrs. Potato Head, much to Mr. Potato Head's delight. As Woody jokingly asks what might be worse than Buzz, they discover Andy's new gift is a puppy, and the two share a worried smile.\

Simon then calls the police, knowing the FBI is there, to inform them that he has placed a bomb in a NYC public school that is rigged with a radio detonator triggered by the use of the FBI and police bands. Simon tells them that he will give McClane and Carver the school's location if they continue to play his game.

After surviving a car chase with Simon's men who had followed Carver and finding that they also had a pre-wrapped roll of quarters, they realize that the roll of quarters would pay for a toll bridge, and they head to a tanker vessel in the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Long_Island_Sound"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Long Island Sound}}. They sneak aboard, learning that the bullion isn't there, but are both captured.\
Simon confirms McClane's suspicions that the school bomb (which had been found using the clues provided by Simon, but turned out to be a dummy) was a trick to distract police before handcuffing the two to the real bomb. He says he is going to destroy the tanker, redistributing the bullion across the Sound, to destroy the economies of the world. Before Simon leaves, McClane jokingly asks him for some aspirin for his hangover, much to Simon's amusement. He happens to have a bottle of aspirin and tosses it to McClane. After Simon leaves, McClane passes a cable splinter to Carver, who picks the handcuffs to free them. They barely escape before the bomb detonates, sinking the tanker.\
As McClane and Carver are debriefed by the police, McClane reports that none of the bullion was on the tanker. McClane notices the bottle of aspirin came from a truckstop located in\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Quebec"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Quebec}}\'a0at the Canada-US border. McClane, Carver, and the police arrive at a warehouse near the truckstop where Simon and his men are in the process of distributing the bullion and planning their escape. The rest of Simon's men are captured, while Simon and his girlfriend Katya attempt to escape in a helicopter, stopping to fire upon McClane and Carver. McClane, armed only with a small revolver, shoots an overhead power line that falls onto the helicopter, crashing it and killing Simon and Katya.

Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class.\
Aware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cal's bodyguard, Mr. Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with an iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.\
Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace.

He shows McCloy a memory card video of Chimera affecting one of Nekhorvich's colleagues before blackmailing McCloy into cooperating with him. Nyah steals the camera's memory card and delivers it to Ethan. They learn that Chimera has a 20-hour dormant period before it causes death by mass destruction of the victim's\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Red_blood_cell"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 red blood cells}}. Bellerophon can only save the victim if used within that 20-hour window. When Nyah discreetly returns the memory card to Ambrose, he notices it is in the wrong pocket of his jacket.\
Ethan's team kidnaps McCloy to force him to give up Bellerophon. However, the only Bellerophon samples were taken by Nekhorvich, and are now in Ambrose's hands. Ambrose has the cure, but does not have the virus; unbeknownst to him at the time, Nekhorvich injected himself with Chimera to smuggle it out of Biocyte. Ambrose plans to exchange a sample of Bellerophon to McCloy for a sample of Chimera. Ethan's team breaks into Biocyte to destroy the virus before the exchange can take place. Ambrose, posing as Ethan, tricks Nyah into revealing the plan, then captures Nyah and raids Biocyte to secure the virus. Ethan is able to destroy all but one sample of Chimera before Ambrose intervenes, and a firefight ensues, culminating in the sample being dropped on the floor between Ambrose and Ethan. Ambrose orders Nyah to retrieve the sample; she instead injects herself with it, preventing Ambrose from simply killing her after she retrieved it for him. Nyah insists that Ethan kill her to destroy the virus but Ethan is unwilling to do so. Ambrose takes Nyah away as Ethan escapes from the laboratory.\
Ambrose releases Nyah to wander the streets of Sydney in a daze, intending to start a pandemic. He offers to sell Bellerophon to McCloy in exchange for stock options, to make him Biocyte's majority shareholder. He predicts that the price of Biocyte's stock will skyrocket due to demand for Bellerophon after the Chimera outbreak. Ethan infiltrates the meeting and steals the remaining samples of Bellerophon. While Ethan is pursued by Ambrose and his men, Luther and Billy locate Nyah, who has wandered to a cliff side, intent on killing herself to prevent the eventual outbreak. Ethan kills Ambrose's men but Ambrose chases him to a beach where Ethan defeats him in a brutal fistfight. With little time left on the 20-hour countdown, Luther reaches Ethan at the beach. As Ethan is about to give Luther the Bellerophon canister, Ambrose recovers and points a gun at Ethan. Ethan throws the canister to Luther and jumps away from Ambrose's shot while kicking up a gun from the sand which he uses to finally kill Ambrose.

Harry kills Quirrell by burning his skin and reducing him to dust, after which Voldemort's spirit rises from Quirrell's ashes and knocks Harry unconscious.\
Harry recovers in the school hospital with Dumbledore at his side. Dumbledore explains that the stone has been destroyed and that Ron and Hermione are safe. Dumbledore also reveals how Harry was able to defeat Quirrell: when Harry's mother died to save him, her death gave Harry a love-based protection against Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione are rewarded with house points for their heroic performances, tying them for first place with Slytherin.

They meet Fiona's parents, King Harold and Queen Lillian, who are shocked to see both their daughter and son-in-law are ogres, with Harold particularly repulsed. At dinner, Shrek and Harold get into a heated argument over how Shrek and Fiona will raise their family, and Fiona, disgusted at Shrek and Harold's behavior, locks herself away in her room that evening. Shrek worries that he has lost his true love, particularly after finding her childhood diary and reading that she was once infatuated with Prince Charming.\
Harold is reprimanded by the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Fairy_Godmother_(Shrek)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Fairy Godmother}}\'a0and her son Prince Charming by reminding him that Charming was to marry Fiona in exchange for his own happy ending.

Unable to defeat Shrek, Puss reveals that he was paid by Harold and offers to come along and make amends. The three sneak into the Fairy Godmother's potion factory and steal a "Happily Ever After" potion that Shrek thinks will restore Fiona's love for him.\
Shrek and Donkey both drink the potion and fall into a deep sleep, awakening the next morning to discover its effects: Shrek is now a handsome man while Donkey has turned into an elegant white stallion. In order to make the change permanent, Shrek must kiss Fiona by midnight. Shrek, Donkey and Puss return to the castle to discover that the potion has transformed Fiona back into her former human self as well. However, the Fairy Godmother, having discovered the potion's theft, intercepts Shrek and sends Charming to pose as him and win Fiona's love. At the Fairy Godmother's urging, Shrek leaves the castle, thinking that the best way to make Fiona happy is to let her go.\
To ensure that Fiona falls in love with Charming, the Fairy Godmother gives Harold a love potion to put into Fiona's tea. This exchange is overheard by Shrek, Donkey and Puss, who are arrested by the royal guards and thrown into a dungeon. While the royal ball begins, several of Shrek's friends band together to free the trio with the help of The Muffin Man's monster-sized\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Gingerbread_man"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 gingerbread man}}, which breaks through the castle's defenses. Shrek is too late to prevent Charming from kissing Fiona, but instead of falling in love with Charming, Fiona knocks him out with a headbutt. Harold reveals that he never gave Fiona the love potion, whereupon the now-enraged Fairy Godmother attacks Shrek. In the ensuing melee, Harold sacrifices himself to save Shrek; his armor ricochets a spell cast by the Fairy Godmother which disintegrates her, and Harold is turned back into the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/The_Frog_Prince"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Frog Prince}}, his original form. Harold gives his blessing to the marriage and apologizes for his earlier behavior, admitting his use of the Happily Ever After potion years earlier to gain Lillian's love.\
As the clock strikes midnight, Fiona rejects Shrek's offer to remain humans, and they happily let the potion's effects wear off and revert to their ogre forms, while Donkey changes back to his natural form as well. In the mid-credits scene, Dragon, who had previously romanced Donkey, reveals that they now have several dragon-donkey hybrid babies, much to his surprise.\

The second task involves the champions diving underwater to rescue their mates. Harry finishes third, but is promoted to second behind Cedric due to his "moral fibre", after saving Fleur's sister Gabrielle as well as Ron. Afterwards, Harry discovers the corpse of Crouch Sr. in the forest. Later, while waiting for Dumbledore in his office, Harry discovers a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Pensieve"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Pensieve}}, which holds Dumbledore's memories.

Exiting the Pensieve, Harry realizes that Crouch Jr. is the man he saw in his dream.\
For the final task, the champions must reach the Triwizard Cup, located in a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Hedge_maze"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 hedge maze}}.

Voldemort releases Harry and challenges him to a duel to prove he is the better wizard. A vulnerable Harry tries the Expelliarmus charm to block Voldemort's attempted Killing Curse. The beams from their wands entwine and Voldemort's wand disgorges the last spells it performed. The spirits of the people he murdered are seen in the graveyard: first Cedric, then Frank Bryce, then Bertha Jorkins, and finally\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Lily_and_James_Potter"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Harry's parents}}. This distracts Voldemort and his Death Eaters, allowing Harry to use the Portkey and escape with Cedric's body.\
Harry tells Dumbledore that Voldemort returned and killed Cedric. Moody takes Harry back to his office to interrogate him about Voldemort, but inadvertently blows his cover by asking Harry whether there were "others in the graveyard", despite Harry not mentioning a graveyard. Moody reveals that he submitted Harry's name to the Goblet of Fire and manipulated Harry throughout the tournament to ensure he would win. Moody attempts to attack Harry, but Dumbledore, Snape, and\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Minerva_McGonagall"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Minerva McGonagall}}\'a0intervene and subdue him.

He is revealed as Crouch Jr. and returned to Azkaban.\
Dumbledore reveals to the students that Voldemort killed Cedric, although the Ministry of Magic opposes the revelation. Later, Dumbledore visits Harry in his dormitory, apologizing to him for the dangers he endured. Harry reveals that he saw his parents in the graveyard; Dumbledore names this effect as "{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Priori_Incantatem"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Priori Incantatem}}".

Dent kidnaps one of Joker\'92s henchmen and threatens him with a seemingly deadly game of heads-or-tails using Dent's lucky coin, which is revealed to be heads on both sides. Dent learns that Rachel is Joker's next target.\
Bruce decides to reveal his secret identity to prevent more deaths. Before he can, however, Dent falsely announces that\'a0

Batman comes to Dent's rescue and Gordon, who faked his death, apprehends the Joker, securing a promotion to Commissioner. Rachel and Dent are escorted away by detectives on Maroni's payroll; Gordon later learns that they never arrived home. Batman interrogates the Joker, who reveals that they have been trapped in separate locations rigged with explosives and that Batman must choose one to save. Batman races to save Rachel, while Gordon attempts to rescue Dent. Batman arrives at the building, but realizes that the Joker sent him to Dent's location instead. Both buildings explode, killing Rachel and disfiguring half of Dent's face. The Joker escapes with Lau, who leads him to the Mob's funds.

Not wanting Reese's revelation to interfere with his plans, the Joker threatens to destroy a hospital unless Reese is killed within an hour. All hospitals are evacuated and Gordon travels to secure Reese. The Joker, disguised as a hospital nurse, discovers Dent's ward and hands him a gun, convincing him to seek revenge for Rachel's death. The Joker then destroys the hospital and escapes with a busload of hostages. Dent goes on a killing spree, deciding the fates of people he holds responsible for Rachel's death by flipping his lucky coin, which was disfigured on one face by the explosion. Dent eventually apprehends Gordon's family, believing Gordon's love for his family parallels his love for Rachel.\
After announcing that Gotham City will be subject to his rule by nightfall, the Joker rigs two evacuating ferries with explosives; one containing civilians and the other containing prisoners. The passengers have been supplied with a trigger to the other boat's explosives, and the Joker announces through an intercom that he will blow both ferries if one of them has not been destroyed by midnight. Batman finds the Joker by using a sonar device that spies on the entire city, with the reluctant help of\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Lucius_Fox"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Lucius Fox}}. Both the civilians and the prisoners refuse to kill each other, while Batman apprehends the Joker after a brief fight. Before the police arrive to take the Joker into custody, he gloats that Gotham's citizens will lose hope once Dent's rampage becomes public knowledge.\
Gordon and Batman arrive at the building where Rachel perished and find Dent threatening to kill Gordon's family. Dent again flips his coin and shoots Batman, spares himself, and aims to kill Gordon's son while claiming that Gordon's negligence is responsible for Rachel's death. Before he can flip his coin for the boy, Batman, who was wearing body armor, tackles Dent off the building to his death. Batman persuades Gordon to let him take responsibility for the killing spree to preserve Dent's heroic image.

They made it home, where Lotso found he had been replaced. Lotso's personality changed; he lied to Big Baby, saying Daisy had replaced all of them. When they found Sunnyside, Lotso took over it, turning it into a toy prison, and Chuckles only escaped because Bonnie took him home for repair.\
At Sunnyside, Andy's toys are horrified at the toddlers' rough play. Buzz asks Lotso to move the toys to the older children's room, but Lotso turns on Buzz and restores him to original factory setting, erasing his memory. Mrs. Potato Head, through an eye she lost in Andy's room, sees Andy searching for them. They realize Woody was telling the truth and try to leave. Andy's toys are imprisoned by Lotso's henchmen who rely on "new recruits" to save themselves from the preschoolers' abuse.\
Woody returns to Sunnyside and learns from a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Chatter_Telephone"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Chatter Telephone}}\'a0that the only way out is through the trash. Andy's toys accidentally reset Buzz to Spanish mode instead of his old persona. Spanish Buzz promptly allies himself with Woody and falls in love with Jessie. The toys reach a dumpster, but are cornered by Lotso's gang. As a garbage truck approaches, Woody reveals Lotso's deception to Big Baby, who throws Lotso into the dumpster. As the toys try to leave, Lotso's henchmen retreat and Lotso drags Woody into the dumpster as the truck collects the trash. The rest of the toys fall into the truck while trying to rescue him, except Barbie, Ken and Big Baby. A falling television lands on Buzz, restoring his memory and personality. The truck brings the toys to a landfill, where the Aliens are swept away by spotting an industrial claw and the other toys are deposited on a conveyor belt that leads to an\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Incineration"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 incinerator}}. Woody and Buzz help Lotso reach an emergency stop button, only for Lotso to abandon them and escape.

Woody and the other toys board another garbage truck back to Andy's house.\
Woody leaves a note for Andy, who, thinking the note is from his mother, donates the toys to Bonnie. To Andy's surprise, Woody is at the bottom of the donation box and Bonnie recognizes him. Though hesitant at first, Andy passes Woody on to Bonnie, and they play together before he leaves. Woody and the other toys witness Andy's departure as they begin their new lives with Bonnie.\

Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.\
The Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk falls to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Stark_Tower"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Stark Tower}}\'a0to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.\
Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's location. Banner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians. The Hulk finds Loki and beats him into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Midtown Manhattan}}. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed.\

After Elsa accidentally injures Anna with her magic, their parents, the King and Queen, take both siblings to a colony of trolls led by Grand Pabbie.

Elsa shuts Anna out, causing a rift between them. Unable to control it, Elsa can only suppress her power, causing her to become more insecure. When the sisters are teenagers, their parents die at sea during a storm.\
When Elsa turns 21, she is to be crowned queen of Arendelle. She is terrified that the kingdom's citizens might find out about her powers and fear her.

When Anna's horse returns to Arendelle, Hans sets out to find Anna and Elsa, accompanied by the Duke's minions, who have secret orders to kill Elsa.\
Reaching the ice palace, Anna meets Elsa, but when she reveals what has become of Arendelle, Elsa becomes upset, saying that she cannot undo it, and accidentally freezes Anna's heart. She then makes a giant snow monster named Marshmallow, who chases Anna, Kristoff, and Olaf away. Anna's hair begins turning white, so Kristoff takes her to meet the trolls, his adoptive family. Grand Pabbie reveals that Anna will freeze solid unless "an act of true love" reverses the spell. Kristoff races Anna back home so Hans can give her true love's kiss. Hans and his men reach Elsa's palace, defeating Marshmallow and capturing Elsa. Anna is delivered to Hans but, rather than kissing her, Hans instead reveals that he has actually been plotting to seize the throne of Arendelle by eliminating both sisters. Hans locks Anna in a room to die, and then manipulates the dignitaries into believing that Elsa killed her. He orders the queen's execution, only to discover she has escaped her detention cell.\

Realizing that love is the key to controlling her magic, Elsa ends the winter and gives Olaf his own snow flurry to survive the warmer climate.

In a fit of rage, the Autobots storm the building, during which Bumblebee regains his original form by scanning a passing car, where they rescue Brains and destroy the laboratory, but they soon leave after Joshua announces that they are no longer needed. Attinger forces Joshua to deploy Galvatron and Stinger to attack the Autobots. During the battle, Galvatron's behavior becomes slightly erratic when it starts destroying vehicles, and when it fights Optimus it speaks to him. Lockdown then arrives and abducts Optimus while Galvatron and Stinger retreat; Tessa is inadvertently captured alongside Optimus in the midst of the chaos, leaving Cade and Shane devastated.\
While Lockdown's large prison spacecraft hovers over Chicago to hand over the Seed, Cade, Shane, and the Autobots use the opportunity to sneak on board and rescue Optimus and Tessa, hijacking a smaller ship containing a group of Autobots called the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Dinobots"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Dinobots}}, just before Lockdown leaves Earth. The Autobots reveal to Cade that "Galvatron" is in fact Megatron, who gave K.S.I. the data to build the Transformer drones so he could transfer his consciousness into the Galvatron drone, after they had unknowingly revived him. What's more, Galvatron is plotting to use the Seed and the K.S.I. drones to conquer the world by detonating the Seed in\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Hong_Kong"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Hong Kong}}, as K.S.I. has brought it there to use it in the remote Mongolian desert to create vast amounts of usable Transformium. Cade informs Joshua of Megatron's presence, causing him to have a change of heart and agreeing to hand over the Seed with help from Darcy and his Chinese business associate Su Yueming. Meanwhile, Lockdown discovers Optimus' escape with the Dinobots, and returns to Earth to retrieve them. Optimus decides for the Autobots to no longer help the humans because of how they revived Megatron, but Cade explains to Optimus why he shouldn't lose faith in them. At the K.S.I. facility, during a disagreement between Joshua and Attinger over the Seed, Galvatron reactivates himself and promptly takes control of the K.S.I. drones, and a battle follows in Hong Kong's streets between Cade's group, the Autobots, Cemetery Wind, Galvatron, and his drones. During the fight, Optimus gains the alliance of the Dinobots, who become essential to the Autobots' victory while Bumblebee kills Stinger.\
Lockdown returns to capture Optimus and the Dinobots, using a large\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Magnet"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 magnet}}\'a0in his ship that picks up and drops metal objects, causing destruction to the city. After disabling the magnet, Optimus fights Lockdown at an abandoned factory. In the ensuing duel, Optimus kills Attinger (who still angrily deems all Cybertronians aside from Lockdown as a threat) to save Cade, and avenging the deaths of his fellow Autobots, but this allows Lockdown to pin Optimus down by impaling his chest with his own sword. Cade, Bumblebee, Tessa, and Shane fight Lockdown, with Cade ending up fighting him one-on-one while Tessa and Shane use a tow truck to free Optimus, who kills Lockdown by cutting him in half before using one of his grenades to finish off the remaining drones. Galvatron retreats, vowing to return.\
As Lockdown's ship leaves Earth, Optimus tells the Autobots to protect the Yeagers (with Joshua offering to help the Yeagers build a new home) and lets the Dinobots go, before flying away into space with the Seed to hide it away, sending a message to the Creators that\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Transformers:_The_Last_Knight"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 he is coming for them}}.\

Liu Peiqiang arrives in the control room, but his clearances were revoked due to his undisciplinary acts and he can do little to override the escape process.\
Liu Qi's group arrive at Sulawesi to find that the engine was already fully restored. Globally, most of the planetary thrusters have been repaired as well. However, Earth has moved past Jupiter's\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Roche_limit"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Roche limit}}\'a0and will be destroyed anyway, with the restored thrust unable to propel it away. The group despairs on learning this, but Liu Qi, inspired by recollection of his father's explanation of the thrusters' mechanics as a child, proposes to ignite Jupiter's\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Hydrogen"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 hydrogen}}-abundant atmosphere to blow Earth away.

Liu Peiqiang, learning of this, is able to persuade the United Earth Goverment to use its communication channels to call assistance for the party at Sulawesi, even though MOSS reveals that the solution being attempted has no chance of success based on probability calculations. Other rescue and repair parties arrive and the engine is fired up, but it falls short of being able to ignite the hydrogen. Liu Peiqiang decides to use the space station's engine itself to ignite Jupiter's hydrogen; after disabling MOSS using a fire started with\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Vodka"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 vodka}}\'a0that Makarov smuggled on-board, he pilots the spacecraft into the cloud between Jupiter and Earth, sacrificing himself as the ignition succeeds. Earth is saved from destruction, and continues to move towards the destination star system.\
As the film ends, Liu Qi recounts and envisions the stages of Earth's migration, a process to take 2,500 years and still bound with uncertainty, in a hopeful tone.\

Congressman Stoneman leaves to avoid being connected with Lt. Gov. Lynch's crackdown. Elsie, learning of Dr. Cameron's arrest, goes to Lynch to plead for his release. Lynch, who had been lusting after Elsie, tries to force her to marry him, which causes her to faint. Stoneman returns, causing Elsie to be placed in another room. At first, Stoneman is happy when Lynch tells him he wants to marry a white woman, but is then angered when Lynch tells him that it is Stoneman's daughter. Undercover Klansmen spies go to get help when they discover Elsie's plight after she breaks a window and cries out for help. Elsie falls unconscious again, and revives while gagged and being bound. The Klan, gathered together and with Ben leading them, rides in to gain control of the town. When news about Elsie reaches Ben, he and others go to her rescue. Elsie frees her mouth and screams for help. Lynch is captured. Victorious, the Klansmen celebrate in the streets. Meanwhile, Lynch's militia surrounds and attacks the hut where the Camerons are hiding. The Klansmen, with Ben at their head, race in to save them just in time. The next election day, blacks find a line of mounted and armed Klansmen just outside their homes, and are intimidated into not voting.\

Scarlett and Rhett visit Melanie, who has suffered complications arising from a new pregnancy, on her deathbed. As Scarlett consoles Ashley, Rhett prepares to leave Atlanta. Having realized that it was he she truly loved all along, and not Ashley, Scarlett pleads with Rhett to stay, but Rhett rebuffs her and walks away into the morning fog, leaving her in tears on the staircase, vowing to one day win back his love.\
In 1938, Maria is a free-spirited young Austrian woman studying to become a nun at\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Nonnberg_Abbey"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Nonnberg Abbey}}\'a0in\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Salzburg"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Salzburg}}. Her love of music and the mountains, her youthful enthusiasm and imagination, and her lack of discipline cause some concern among the nuns. The Mother Abbess, believing Maria would be happier outside the abbey, sends her to the villa of retired naval officer Captain Georg von Trapp to be governess to his seven children\'97Liesl, Friedrich, Louisa, Kurt, Brigitta, Marta, and Gretl. The Captain has been raising his children using strict military discipline following the death of his wife. Although the children misbehave at first, Maria responds with kindness and patience, and soon the children come to trust and respect her. Liesl, the oldest, is won over after Maria protects her from discovery when she is nearly caught sneaking back into the house after meeting with Rolfe, a messenger boy she is in love with.\
While the Captain is away in Vienna, Maria makes play clothes for the children and takes them around Salzburg and the surrounding mountains, and teaches them how to sing. When the Captain returns to the villa with Baroness Elsa Schraeder, a wealthy socialite, and their mutual friend, Max Detweiler, they are greeted by Maria and the children returning from a boat ride on the lake that concludes when their boat overturns. Displeased by his children's clothes and activities, and Maria's impassioned appeal that he get closer to his children, the Captain orders her to return to the abbey. Just then he hears singing coming from inside the house and is astonished to see his children singing for the Baroness. Filled with emotion, the Captain joins his children, singing for the first time in years. Afterwards, he apologizes to Maria and asks her to stay.\
Impressed by the children's singing, Max proposes he enter them in the upcoming\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Salzburg_Festival"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Salzburg Festival}}\'a0but the suggestion is immediately rejected by the Captain as he is opposed to his children singing in public. He does agree, however, to organize a grand party at the villa. The night of the party, while guests in formal attire\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Waltz"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 waltz}}\'a0in the ballroom, Maria and the children look on from the garden terrace. When the Captain notices Maria teaching Kurt the traditional\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/L%C3%A4ndler"}}{\fldrslt

Confused about her feelings, Maria blushes and breaks away. Later, the Baroness, who noticed the Captain's attraction to Maria, hides her jealousy while convincing Maria that she must return to the abbey. Back at the abbey, when Mother Abbess learns that Maria has stayed in seclusion to avoid her feelings for the Captain, she encourages her to return to the villa to look for her life. After Maria returns to the villa, she learns about the Captain's engagement to the Baroness and agrees to stay until they find a replacement governess. The Captain's feelings for Maria, however, have not changed, and after breaking off his engagement the Captain marries Maria.\
While the Captain and Maria are on their honeymoon, Max enters the children in the Salzburg Festival against their father's wishes.

Later that night at the festival, during their final number, the von Trapp family slip away and seek shelter at the nearby abbey, where Mother Abbess hides them in the cemetery crypt. Brownshirts soon arrive and search the abbey, and the family is discovered by Rolfe. Upon seeing Liesl, he hesitates raising the alarm long enough to allow the family time to flee, and the family is able to escape using the caretaker's car. When the soldiers attempt to pursue, they discover their cars will not start as two nuns have removed parts of the engines. The next morning, after driving to the Swiss border, the von Trapp family make their way on foot across the frontier into Switzerland to safety and freedom.\

At the Twelve Oaks party, Scarlett privately declares her feelings to Ashley, but he rebuffs her by responding that he and Melanie are more compatible.

The barbecue is disrupted by the declaration of war and the men rush to enlist. As Scarlett watches Ashley kiss Melanie goodbye, Melanie's younger brother Charles proposes to her.

Upon her return home, Scarlett finds Tara deserted, except for her father, her sisters, and two former slaves: Mammy and Pork.

One day at Frank's mill, Scarlett and Ashley are seen embracing by Ashley's sister, India, and harboring an intense dislike of Scarlett she eagerly spreads rumors. Later that evening, Rhett, having heard the rumors, forces Scarlett to attend a birthday party for Ashley. Incapable of believing anything bad of her, Melanie stands by Scarlett's side so that all know that she believes the gossip to be false. After returning home from the party, Scarlett finds Rhett downstairs drunk, and they argue about Ashley.

The meeting is set for the same day as the christening of Connie's baby. While Michael stands at the altar as the child's godfather, Corleone assassins murder the other New York dons and Moe Greene. Tessio is executed for his treachery and Michael extracts Carlo's confession to his complicity in setting up Sonny's murder for Barzini.

Mayor Larry Vaughn overrules him, fearing that the town's summer economy will be ruined. The coroner now concurs with the mayor's theory that Chrissie was killed in a boating accident. Brody reluctantly accepts their conclusion until another fatal shark attack occurs shortly thereafter. A bounty is placed on the shark, prompting an amateur shark-hunting frenzy. Local professional shark hunter Quint offers his services for $10,000. Meanwhile, consulting oceanographer Matt Hooper examines Chrissie's remains, and confirms her death was caused by a shark\'97an unusually large one.\
When local fishermen catch a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Tiger_shark"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 tiger shark}}, the mayor proclaims the beaches safe.

He drops it in fright after encountering a partial corpse. Vaughn discounts Brody and Hooper's claims that a huge great white shark is responsible for the deaths, and refuses to close the beaches, allowing only added safety precautions. On the Fourth of July weekend, tourists pack the beaches. Following a juvenile prank in which the presence of a shark is simulated, the real shark enters a nearby\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Estuary"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 estuary}}, killing a boater and causing Brody's oldest son, Michael, to go into shock. Brody then convinces Vaughn to hire Quint.\
Quint, Brody, and Hooper set out on Quint's boat, the\'a0

\f0\i0 , to hunt the shark. While Brody lays down a\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Chumming"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 chum}}\'a0line, Quint waits for an opportunity to hook the shark. Without warning, it appears behind the boat. Quint, estimating its length at 25 feet (7.6\'a0m) and weight at 3 tons, harpoons it with a line attached to a flotation barrel, but the shark pulls the barrel underwater and disappears.\
At nightfall, Quint and Hooper drunkenly exchange stories about their assorted scars and Quint reveals that he survived the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/USS_Indianapolis_(CA-35)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 USS\'a0

In the morning, Brody attempts to call the Coast Guard, but Quint, who has become obsessed with killing the shark without outside assistance, smashes the radio. After a long chase, Quint harpoons another barrel into the shark. The line is tied to the stern cleats, but the shark drags the boat backward, swamping the deck and flooding the engine compartment. Quint prepares to sever the line to prevent the transom from being pulled out but the cleats break off, keeping the barrels attached to the shark. Quint heads toward shore to draw the shark into shallower waters, but he intentionally pushes the damaged engine past the safety limits and the overtaxed engine fails.\

The shark demolishes the cage before Hooper can inject it, but he manages to escape to the seabed. The shark then attacks the boat directly and devours Quint. Trapped on the sinking vessel, Brody jams a pressurized scuba tank into the shark's mouth, and, climbing the crow's nest, shoots the tank with a rifle. The resulting explosion obliterates the shark. Hooper surfaces, and he and Brody paddle back to Amity Island clinging to the remaining barrels.\

A grief-stricken Elliott is left alone with the motionless E.T. when he notices a dead chrysanthemum, the plant E.T. had previously revived, coming back to life. E.T. reanimates and reveals that his people are returning. Elliott and Michael steal a van that E.T. had been loaded into and a chase ensues, with Michael's friends joining them as they attempt to evade the authorities by bicycles. Suddenly facing a police roadblock, they escape as E.T. uses\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Psychokinesis"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 telekinesis}}\'a0to lift them into the air and toward the forest, like he had done for Elliott before.\
Standing near the spaceship, E.T.'s heart glows as he prepares to return home. Mary, Gertie, and "Keys", a friendly government agent, show up. E.T. says goodbye to Michael and Gertie, as she presents him with the chrysanthemum that he had revived. Before boarding the spaceship, he embraces Elliott and tells him "I'll be right here", pointing his glowing finger to Elliott's forehead. He then picks up the chrysanthemum, boards the spaceship, and it takes off, leaving a rainbow in the sky as everyone watches it leave.\

Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class.\
Aware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cal's bodyguard, Mr. Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with an iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.\
Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Lovejoy slips the necklace into Jack's pocket and he and Cal accuse him of theft.

With the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.\

After defending the title multiple times, he is prepared to retire, but the number one contender,\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Clubber_Lang"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 James "Clubber" Lang}}\'a0(played by\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Mr._T"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Mr. T}}), challenges Rocky publicly. Rocky, after dealing with Mickey's heart attack before the fight, is overpowered by the stronger, hungrier Lang and is knocked out in the second round. Mickey passes away after the fight, and former rival Apollo Creed steps in, training Rocky to fight in Creed's old style (in his old Los Angeles gym) and to use more guile and skill. In the rematch, Rocky outboxes Lang, tiring the stronger fighter out and eventually knocking him out in the third round. After the fight, Apollo calls in his "favor" for training Rocky, which is a one-on-one match between the two of them with no cameras, no media, just man vs. man in the gym. The film ends as they each throw their first punch.\
After winning back his title from Clubber Lang, Rocky continues to live the good life, now that he and Apollo are good friends. However, a new fighter from the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Soviet_Union"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 USSR}},\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Ivan_Drago"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Ivan Drago}}\'a0(played by\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Dolph_Lundgren"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Dolph Lundgren}}), has emerged and challenges Rocky to an exhibition match. Apollo fights instead, and the beating he takes from Drago ends with Apollo dying in Rocky's arms in the ring as Drago coldly watches. To avenge Apollo, Rocky challenges Drago to a match, which is to be held on Christmas Day in Moscow. In a montage replete with symbolism, Rocky is shown training in a remote cabin in Siberia with the help of Creed's old trainer Duke, his brother-in-law Paulie, and eventually Adrian, doing exercises such as chopping wood, lifting rocks, running in the snow and climbing a mountain, while Drago is seen in an advanced training facility running on treadmills, utilizing weightlifting machines and injecting steroids to boost his strength. During the fight, Rocky takes the worst beating of his life but refuses to fall. He eventually wins over the foreign crowd with his display of courage and determination, and he knocks Drago out with seconds left in the final round.\
In the aftermath of his fight with Ivan Drago, Rocky Balboa is diagnosed with brain damage and is forced to retire from the ring. Additionally, the Balboa fortune is all gone due to an unscrupulous accountant. Rocky's family returns to their old neighborhood and Adrian returns to the pet store she used to work at, while (in a subplot) Rocky (Robert) Jr. (played by Sylvester Stallone's\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Sage_Stallone"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 real son Sage}}) deals with bullying at his school and Rocky re-opens Mickey's old gym. While training other boxers, Rocky meets a young, hungry boxer named\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Tommy_Gunn_(character)"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Tommy Gunn}}\'a0(played by real-life fighter\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Tommy_Morrison"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Tommy Morrison}}) and begins training him which results in a strained relationship with Robert. Unfortunately, as Tommy begins his rise to fame under Rocky's wing, a sleazy fight promoter named George Washington Duke convinces Tommy that Rocky is holding him back and Tommy leaves Rocky for Duke. After Tommy wins the heavyweight title, he makes a short speech thanking Duke, and is met with jeers and the familiar chant of "Rocky" from the crowd. Seething from this insult, as well as being called by publicists as "Rocky's robot" and being told that he's "no Rocky Balboa," Tommy decides to seek out his former mentor for a final showdown. Rocky starts to walk away from the public challenge, but Paulie decides to let Tommy have a piece of his mind about how Tommy has treated Rocky, and Tommy proceeds to punch Paulie. Rocky then challenges Tommy outside and the two proceed in a violent bare-knuckle street brawl, which Rocky wins. Rocky then proceeds to punch Duke for harassing him. In the end, Rocky and Robert reconcile as they run up the steps as father and son.\

Long retired, Rocky Balboa still staggers around an ever-changing world; his son is grown and distant, Paulie is working back at the meat plant, and Rocky's wife Adrian has died.

Rocky almost wins the fight but loses in a split decision just like the first film (in an alternate ending Rocky won). Rocky is last seen visiting his wife's grave saying, "Yo Adrian, we did it."\
Adonis "Donnie" Johnson ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Michael_B._Jordan"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Michael B.

Rocky is reluctant, but eventually agrees. When word gets out that Donnie is Creed's illegitimate son, the handlers of world light heavyweight champion "Pretty" Ricky Conlan, who is forced into retirement by an impending prison term, offer to make Donnie the latter's final challenger\'97provided that he change his name to Adonis Creed. Donnie balks at first, wanting to forge his own legacy. However, he eventually agrees. While helping Donnie train, Rocky learns he has\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Non-Hodgkin%27s_lymphoma"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 non-Hodgkin's lymphoma}}.

Conlan wins by split decision, but Donnie wins the respect of Conlan and the crowd, with Conlan calling Donnie the future of the light heavyweight division. Returning to Philadelphia, Donnie and a recovering Rocky both make their way up\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Rocky_Steps"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 the Philadelphia Museum steps}}\'a0and look at the skyline.\
Three years after losing the fight to "Pretty" Ricky Conlan, Adonis Johnson Creed wins the World Heavyweight Championship and proposes to his girlfriend, Bianca Taylor ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Tessa_Thompson"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Tessa Thompson}}). Meanwhile, three decades since the death of Apollo Creed and his loss to Rocky Balboa, Ivan Drago is training his son, Viktor Drago (Florian Munteanu), to reclaim their honor by having Viktor publicly challenge Adonis for the World Heavyweight Title. Rocky is reluctant to train Adonis, fearing Adonis will meet the same fate as his father, but Adonis accepts the challenge without him and is badly injured during the fight. Because of Viktor's disqualification, Adonis retains the title. Viktor demands a rematch, while he is being promoted by his father's supporters who originally abandoned Drago, including Drago's ex-wife, Ludmilla ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Brigette_Nielsen"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Brigette Nielsen}}). Viktor is subjected to vicious training sessions in preparation for the rematch. Rocky comes to Adonis' aid and decides to train him in the Southern California desert, with a different tactic for Adonis to take in Viktor's powerful punches. The rematch is set in Moscow, and Adonis is able to take Viktor's powerful punches, while leaving Viktor exhausted. Viktor's supporters and his mother leave during the fight with doubt that Viktor will win. Drago seeing his son taking Adonis\'92 punches without fighting back, throws in the towel and assures his son that he is more important to him and that he will not abandon him like he was. While Rocky later reunites with his son, Robert ({\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Milo_Ventimiglia"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Milo Ventimiglia}}) and meets his grandson, Adonis brings Bianca and their newborn baby girl to his late father's grave, making peace with his late father and honoring his legacy.\

Sometimes, crossovers occur even when there was no explicit intent to create them. Viewer interpretation can play into the size and complexity of crossovers.

Perhaps the best example of this was caused by the unusual ending to\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/St._Elsewhere"}}{\fldrslt

Klaue tells Ross that Wakanda's international image is a front for a technologically advanced civilization. Erik attacks and extracts Klaue as Ross is gravely injured protecting Nakia. Rather than pursue Klaue, T'Challa takes Ross to Wakanda, where their technology can save him.\
While Shuri heals Ross, T'Challa confronts Zuri about N'Jobu. Zuri explains that N'Jobu planned to share Wakanda's technology with people of African descent around the world to help them conquer their oppressors. As T'Chaka arrested N'Jobu, the latter attacked Zuri and forced T'Chaka to kill him.

Meanwhile, Killmonger kills Klaue and takes his body to Wakanda. He is brought before the tribal elders, revealing his identity to be N'Jadaka and claim to the throne. Killmonger challenges T'Challa to ritual combat, where he kills Zuri, defeats T'Challa, and hurls him over a waterfall to his presumed death. Killmonger ingests the heart-shaped herb and orders the rest incinerated, but Nakia extracts one first. Killmonger, supported by W'Kabi and his army, prepares to distribute shipments of Wakandan weapons to operatives around the world.\
Nakia, Shuri, Ramonda, and Ross flee to the Jabari Tribe for aid. They find a comatose T'Challa, rescued by the Jabari in repayment for sparing M'Baku's life. Healed by Nakia's herb, T'Challa returns to fight Killmonger, who dons his own Black Panther suit. W'Kabi and his army fight Shuri, Nakia, and the Dora Milaje, while Ross remotely pilots a jet and shoots down planes carrying the vibranium weapons. M'Baku and the Jabari arrive to reinforce T'Challa. Confronted by Okoye, W'Kabi and his army stand down. Fighting in Wakanda's vibranium mine, T'Challa disrupts Killmonger's suit and stabs him.

Killian, who appropriated Hansen's Extremis research as a cure for his own disability and expanded the program to include injured war veterans, reveals he is the real Mandarin behind Slattery's cover. After capturing Stark, Killian reveals that he has subjected Potts to Extremis in the hope that Stark will help fix Extremis's flaws while trying to save her.

Stark saves some surviving passengers and crew but cannot stop Killian from abducting Ellis and destroying Air Force One. They trace Killian to an impounded damaged oil tanker where Killian intends to kill Ellis on live television. The Vice President will become a puppet leader, following Killian's orders in exchange for Extremis to cure his young daughter's disability. On the platform, Stark works to save Potts, as Rhodes goes after the President. Stark summons his remaining Iron Man suits, controlled remotely by J.A.R.V.I.S., to provide air support. Rhodes secures the President and takes him to safety, while Stark discovers Potts has survived the Extremis procedure; before he can save her, a rig collapses around them and she falls to her apparent death. Stark confronts Killian and traps him in an Iron Man suit that he self-destructs, but fails to kill him. Potts, whose Extremis powers allowed her to survive her fall, intervenes and kills Killian.\
Stark orders J.A.R.V.I.S. to remotely destroy each Iron Man suit as a sign of his devotion to Potts, while the Vice President and Slattery are arrested. With Stark's help, Potts' Extremis effects are stabilized, and Stark promises to scale back his life as Iron Man, undergoing surgery to remove the shrapnel near his heart and throwing his obsolete chest arc reactor into the sea. He muses that, even without the technology, he will always be Iron Man.\

Shaken by the reveal, Rogers, along with Romanoff and Wilson, is captured by S.T.R.I.K.E. Rogers deduces that Bucky survived the fall after being captured and experimented on by Zola, and that Hydra must have found him afterwards. Having infiltrated the S.T.R.I.K.E. agents, Hill manages to extract the trio to a safehouse where Fury, revealed to have faked his death, is waiting with plans to sabotage the Helicarriers by replacing three of their controller chips. At a bank, Hydra agents come together to debrief the Winter Soldier; after discovering that he recognized Rogers, Pierce orders that his memory be wiped.\
As members of the World Security Council arrive for the launch of Project Insight, Rogers infiltrates the Triskelion and broadcasts Hydra's plot to everyone there. Romanoff, disguised as one of the Council members, disarms Pierce and accesses his computer. Fury then arrives and forces Pierce to help him unlock S.H.I.E.L.D.'s database so that Romanoff can leak classified information, exposing Hydra to the public. Pierce attempts to escape after revealing he can indirectly kill all the World Security Council members, including the disguised Romanoff; following a struggle, Fury kills Pierce. Meanwhile, Rogers and Wilson storm two of the Helicarriers and replace the controller chips. However, the Winter Soldier is waiting on the third one, and after destroying Wilson's suit he begins to fight Rogers. Rogers fends him off and replaces the final chip, allowing Hill to take control and have the vessels destroy each other. Seeing the Winter Soldier still on the Helicarrier, Rogers approaches him, refusing to fight him in an attempt to reach his friend. As the Winter Soldier once again begins to recognize him, the ship collides with the Triskelion, throwing Rogers into the\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Potomac_River"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Potomac River}}. Diving in after him, the Winter Soldier rescues the unconscious Rogers before disappearing into the woods.\
With S.H.I.E.L.D. in disarray, Romanoff makes an official statement before a Senate subcommittee, and Fury, under the cover of his apparent death, heads to Eastern Europe in pursuit of Hydra's remaining cells. Rumlow is hospitalized after being crushed during the Triskelion's destruction, Romanoff (who revealed her own tainted past after leaking the S.H.I.E.L.D. files) leaves to find a new cover, and Wilson decides to help Rogers search for the Winter Soldier.\

Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.\
The Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk falls to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth.

Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's location. Banner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians. The Hulk finds Loki and beats him into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at\'a0{\field{\*\fldinst{HYPERLINK "applewebdata://7998BC3A-FC84-49B5-A62D-C9951A11A103/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan"}}{\fldrslt \cf3 \ul \ulc3 \strokec3 Midtown Manhattan}}. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed.\

Stane's scientists cannot duplicate Stark's miniaturized arc reactor, so Stane ambushes Stark at his home and takes the one from his chest. Stark manages to get to his original reactor to replace it. Potts and several S.H.I.E.L.D. agents attempt to arrest Stane, but he dons his suit and attacks them. Stark fights Stane, but is outmatched without his new reactor to run his suit at full capacity. The fight carries Stark and Stane to the top of the Stark Industries building, and Stark instructs Potts to overload the large arc reactor powering the building. This unleashes a massive electrical surge that causes Stane and his armor to fall into the exploding reactor, killing him. The next day, at a press conference, Stark defies suggestions from S.H.I.E.L.D. and publicly admits to being "Iron Man."\

In Asgard, Loki betrays and kills Laufey, revealing his true plan to use Laufey's attempt on Odin's life as an excuse to destroy Jotunheim with the Bifr\'f6st Bridge, thus proving himself worthy to his adoptive father. Thor arrives and fights Loki before destroying the Bifr\'f6st Bridge to stop Loki's plan, stranding himself in Asgard. Odin awakens and prevents the brothers from falling into the abyss created in the wake of the bridge's destruction, but Loki apparently commits suicide by allowing himself to fall when Odin rejects his pleas for approval.

After Ross explains how Banner became the Hulk, Blonsky agrees to be injected with a small amount of a similar serum, which gives him enhanced speed, strength, agility, and healing, but also begins to deform his skeleton and impair his judgment.\

Sterns warns that the combination of the super-soldier formula and Banner's blood may cause him to become an "abomination", but Blonsky insists. The experiment mutates Blonsky into a creature with size and strength surpassing that of the Hulk, but drives him insane. He attacks Sterns, who gets some of Banner's blood in a cut on his forehead, causing him to begin mutating as well.\

After release of\'a0

\f0\i0 \'a0in 1983, Lucas gave many hints about many of the plot elements from his discarded 1980s script treatments for the sequel trilogy, or what would happen if he were to make a sequel trilogy. Those discarded plots continued to fascinate fans for decades, as many of them were completely unaffected by the conclusion of the original trilogy; thus leaving the sequel trilogy a possibility of using them.\
While many ideas seem to have been retained, these two particular ideas were apparently discarded for Lucasfilm's sequel trilogy, under Disney's ownership:\

This decision meant that Lucas decided to further cancel the sequel trilogy, with many hundreds of subsequent other works set after the original trilogy. From 1997 onwards, Lucas took it a step further, when he ceased to talk about his sequel trilogy ideas. When asked, he would frequently repeat that he had no plans to make the sequel trilogy and that he would not allow other directors to make it.

At a 1997 "Special Edition" press conference, Lucas said: "Everyone said, 'Well, are you going to do sequels to the first three?' But that was an afterthought; I don't have scripts on those stories. The only notion on that was, wouldn't it be fun to get all the actors to come back when they're 60 or 70 years old and make three more about them as old people."
