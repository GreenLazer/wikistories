<p><i>Star Trek</i> creator Gene Roddenberry first suggested the idea of a <i>Star Trek</i> feature in 1969.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-reeves-stevens_155_2-0"><a href="#cite_note-reeves-stevens_155-2">[2]</a></sup> When the original television series was canceled, he lobbied to continue the franchise through a film.

Paramount instead planned on returning the franchise to its roots with a new television series, <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Trek:_Phase_II" title="Star Trek: Phase II">Star Trek: Phase II</a></i>. The massive worldwide box office success of <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_(film)" title="Star Wars (film)">Star Wars</a></i> in mid-1977 sent Hollywood studios to their vaults in search of similar sci-fi properties that could be adapted or re-launched to the big screen. When Columbia's <i><a href="/wiki/Close_Encounters_of_the_Third_Kind" title="Close Encounters of the Third Kind">Close Encounters of the Third Kind</a></i> had a huge opening in late December 1977, Paramount was convinced that science fiction films other than <i><a href="/wiki/Star_Wars_(film)" title="Star Wars (film)">Star Wars</a></i> could do well at the box office, and production of <i>Phase II</i> was cancelled in favor of making a <i>Star Trek</i> film.<sup class="noprint Inline-Template Template-Fact" style="white-space:nowrap;">[<i><a href="/wiki/Wikipedia:Citation_needed" title="Wikipedia:Citation needed"><span title="This claim needs references to reliable sources.

</p><p>This revival of the franchise is often considered to be, and referred to as, a "reboot", but it is technically a continuation of the franchise (Nimoy reprises his role of Spock from the previous films) that establishes an alternate reality from the previous films. This route was taken, over a <a href="/wiki/Reboot_(fiction)" title="Reboot (fiction)">traditional reboot</a>, to free the new films from the restrictions of established continuity without completely discarding it, which the writers felt would have been "disrespectful". This new reality was informally referred to by several names, including the "Abramsverse", "JJ Trek" and "NuTrek", before it was named the "Kelvin Timeline" (versus the "Prime Timeline" of the original series and films) by <a href="/wiki/Michael_Okuda" title="Michael Okuda">Michael</a> and <a href="/wiki/Denise_Okuda" title="Denise Okuda">Denise Okuda</a> for use in official <i>Star Trek</i> reference guides and encyclopedias. The name Kelvin comes from the USS <i>Kelvin</i>, a starship involved in the event that creates the new reality in <i>Star Trek</i> (2009).

McQueen reluctantly leaves with the media to get to California in time for the race while Sally chastises Doc upon discovering that he had tipped off the media to McQueen's whereabouts, not wanting to be discovered by them instead.
</p><p>At the Los Angeles International Speedway, McQueen's mind is not fully set on the race due to him missing Sally and his other new friends and he soon falls into last place. He is surprised to discover that Doc, who is decked out in his old racing colors, has taken over as his crew chief along with several other cars from Radiator Springs to help in the pit. Inspired and recalling tricks he learned from Doc and his friends, McQueen quickly emerges to lead the race into the final laps. But at the last minute Hicks (refusing to come behind Weathers again) side swipes Weathers and sends him into a dangerous spin, causing him to crash. Seeing this and recalling Doc's fate, McQueen stops just short of the finish line which allows Hicks to win and drives back to push Weathers over the finish line. The crowd and media condemn Hicks' victory but are nonetheless impressed with McQueen's good sportsmanship. Though offered the Dinoco sponsorship deal, McQueen declines by insisting on staying with Rust-eze as an appreciation of their past support. Back at Radiator Springs, McQueen returns to reunite with Sally and announces that he will be setting up his racing headquarters, thereby putting Radiator Springs back on the map.

<p>In 2154, humans have depleted <a href="/wiki/Earth" title="Earth">Earth</a>'s natural resources, leading to a severe energy crisis. The Resources Development Administration (RDA for short) mines for a valuable mineral — <a href="/wiki/Unobtainium" title="Unobtainium">unobtanium</a> — on Pandora, a densely forested <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Habitable_moon" title="Habitable moon">habitable moon</a> orbiting the <a href="/wiki/Gas_giant" title="Gas giant">gas giant</a> Polyphemus in the <a href="/wiki/Alpha_Centauri" title="Alpha Centauri">Alpha Centauri</a> star system.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Horwitz2009_11-1"><a href="#cite_note-Horwitz2009-11">[11]</a></sup> Pandora, whose atmosphere is poisonous to humans, is inhabited by the <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere#Naʼvi" title="Pandoran biosphere">Na'vi</a>, a species of 10-foot tall (3.0 m), blue-skinned, <a href="/wiki/Wisdom" title="Wisdom">sapient</a> humanoids<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-35"><a href="#cite_note-35">[35]</a></sup> that live in harmony with nature and worship a <a href="/wiki/Mother_goddess" title="Mother goddess">mother goddess</a> named Eywa.
</p><p>To explore <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere" title="Pandoran biosphere">Pandora's biosphere</a>, scientists use Na'vi-human hybrids called "avatars", operated by genetically matched humans; Jake Sully, a paraplegic former <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/United_States_Marine" title="United States Marine">Marine</a>, replaces his deceased identical twin brother as an operator of one. Dr. Grace Augustine, head of the Avatar Program, considers Sully an inadequate replacement but accepts his assignment as a bodyguard. While protecting the avatars of Grace and fellow scientist Dr. Norm Spellman as they collect biological data, Jake's avatar is attacked by a <a href="/wiki/Pandoran_biosphere#Fauna" title="Pandoran biosphere">thanator</a> and flees into the forest, where he is rescued by Neytiri, a female Na'vi. Witnessing an auspicious sign, she takes him to her clan, whereupon Neytiri's mother Mo'at, the clan's spiritual leader, orders her daughter to initiate Jake into their society.
</p><p><a href="/wiki/Colonel" title="Colonel">Colonel</a> Miles Quaritch, head of RDA's <a href="/wiki/Private_military_company" title="Private military company">private security force</a>, promises Jake that the company will restore his legs if he gathers information about the Na'vi and the clan's gathering place, a giant tree called Hometree,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Script25_36-0"><a href="#cite_note-Script25-36">[36]</a></sup> which stands above the richest deposit of unobtanium in the area. When Grace learns of this, she transfers herself, Jake, and Norm to an <a class="extiw" href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/outpost" title="wikt:outpost">outpost</a>. Over the following three months, Jake grows to sympathize with the natives. After Jake is initiated into the tribe, he and Neytiri choose each other as mates, and soon afterward, Jake reveals his change of allegiance when he attempts to disable a bulldozer that threatens to destroy a sacred Na'vi site. When Quaritch shows a video recording of Jake's attack on the bulldozer to Administrator Parker Selfridge,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Script8and15_37-0"><a href="#cite_note-Script8and15-37">[37]</a></sup> and another in which Jake admits that the Na'vi will never abandon Hometree, Selfridge orders Hometree destroyed.
</p><p>Despite Grace's argument that destroying Hometree could damage the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Biological_neural_network" title="Biological neural network">biological neural network</a> native to Pandora, Selfridge gives Jake and Grace one hour to convince the Na'vi to evacuate before commencing the attack. While trying to warn the Na'vi, Jake confesses to being a spy, and the Na'vi take him and Grace captive. Seeing this, Quaritch's men destroy Hometree, killing Neytiri's father (the clan chief) and many others. Mo'at frees Jake and Grace, but they are detached from their avatars and imprisoned by Quaritch's forces. Pilot Trudy Chacón, disgusted by Quaritch's brutality, frees Jake and Grace and airlifts them to Grace's outpost, but during the escape Quaritch fires at them, hitting Grace.
</p><p>To regain the Na'vi's trust, Jake connects his mind to that of Toruk, a dragon-like predator feared and honored by the Na'vi. Jake finds the refugees at the sacred <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Fictional_universe_in_Avatar#The_Tree_of_Souls" title="Fictional universe in Avatar">Tree of Souls</a> and pleads with Mo'at to heal Grace. The clan attempts to transfer Grace from her human body into her avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls, but she dies before the process can be completed. Supported by the new chief Tsu'tey, Jake speaks to unite the clan and tells them to gather all of the clans to battle against the RDA. Noticing the impending gathering, Quaritch organizes a <a href="/wiki/Preemptive_war" title="Preemptive war">pre-emptive strike</a> against the Tree of Souls, believing that its destruction will demoralize the natives. On the eve of battle, Jake prays to Eywa, via a neural connection with the Tree of Souls, to intercede on behalf of the Na'vi.
</p><p>During the subsequent battle, the Na'vi suffer heavy casualties, including Tsu'tey and Trudy; but are rescued when <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Characters_and_wildlife_in_Avatar#Fauna" title="Characters and wildlife in Avatar">Pandoran wildlife</a> unexpectedly join the attack and overwhelm the humans, which Neytiri interprets as Eywa's answer to Jake's prayer. Jake destroys a makeshift bomber before it can reach the Tree of Souls; Quaritch, wearing an <a href="/wiki/Mecha" title="Mecha">AMP suit</a>, escapes from his own damaged aircraft and breaks open the avatar link unit containing Jake's human body, exposing it to Pandora's poisonous atmosphere. Quaritch prepares to slit the throat of Jake's avatar, but Neytiri kills Quaritch and saves Jake from suffocation.
</p><p>With the exceptions of Jake, Norm and a select few others, all humans are expelled from Pandora and sent back to Earth, after which Jake is permanently transferred into his avatar with the aid of the Tree of Souls.

<p>In 1996, treasure hunter Brock Lovett and his team aboard the research vessel <i><a href="/wiki/Akademik_Mstislav_Keldysh" title="Akademik Mstislav Keldysh">Akademik Mstislav Keldysh</a></i> search the wreck of RMS <i>Titanic</i> for a necklace with a rare diamond, the <a href="/wiki/Heart_of_the_Ocean" title="Heart of the Ocean">Heart of the Ocean</a>. They recover a safe containing a drawing of a young woman wearing only the necklace dated April 14, 1912, the day the ship struck the iceberg.<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-8"><a href="#cite_note-8">[Note 1]</a></sup> Rose Dawson Calvert, the woman in the drawing, is brought aboard <i>Keldysh</i> and tells Lovett of her experiences aboard <i>Titanic</i>.
</p><p>In 1912 <a href="/wiki/Southampton" title="Southampton">Southampton</a>, 17-year-old first-class passenger Rose DeWitt Bukater, her fiancé Cal Hockley, and her mother Ruth board the luxurious <i>Titanic</i>. Ruth emphasizes that Rose's marriage will resolve their family's financial problems and retain their high-class persona. Distraught over the engagement, Rose considers suicide by jumping from the stern; Jack Dawson, a penniless artist, intervenes and discourages her. Discovered with Jack, Rose tells a concerned Cal that she was peering over the edge and Jack saved her from falling. When Cal becomes indifferent, she suggests to him that Jack deserves a reward. He invites Jack to dine with them in first class the following night. Jack and Rose develop a tentative friendship, despite Cal and Ruth being wary of him. Following dinner, Rose secretly joins Jack at a party in third class.
</p><p>Aware of Cal and Ruth's disapproval, Rose rebuffs Jack's advances, but realizes she prefers him over Cal. After rendezvousing on the bow at sunset, Rose takes Jack to her state room; at her request, Jack sketches Rose posing nude wearing Cal's engagement present, the Heart of the Ocean necklace. They evade Cal's bodyguard, Mr. Lovejoy, and have sex in an automobile inside the cargo hold. On the forward deck, they witness a collision with an iceberg and overhear the officers and designer discussing its seriousness.
</p><p>Cal discovers Jack's sketch of Rose and an insulting note from her in his safe along with the necklace. When Jack and Rose attempt to inform Cal of the collision, Lovejoy slips the necklace into Jack's pocket and he and Cal accuse him of theft. Jack is arrested, taken to the <a href="/wiki/Master-at-arms" title="Master-at-arms">master-at-arms</a>' office, and handcuffed to a pipe. Cal puts the necklace in his own coat pocket.
</p><p>With the ship sinking, Rose flees Cal and her mother, who has boarded a lifeboat, and frees Jack. On the boat deck, Cal and Jack encourage her to board a lifeboat; Cal claims he can get himself and Jack off safely. After Rose boards one, Cal tells Jack the arrangement is only for himself. As her boat lowers, Rose decides that she cannot leave Jack and jumps back on board. Cal takes his bodyguard's pistol and chases Rose and Jack into the flooding first-class dining saloon. After using up his ammunition, Cal realizes he gave his coat and consequently the necklace to Rose. He later boards a collapsible lifeboat by carrying a lost child.
</p><p>After braving several obstacles, Jack and Rose return to the boat deck. The lifeboats have departed and passengers are falling to their deaths as the stern rises out of the water. The ship breaks in half, lifting the stern into the air. Jack and Rose ride it into the ocean and he helps her onto a wooden panel buoyant enough for only one person. He assures her that she will die an old woman, warm in her bed. Jack dies of <a href="/wiki/Hypothermia" title="Hypothermia">hypothermia</a><sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Carlson_9-0"><a href="#cite_note-Carlson-9">[8]</a></sup> but Rose is saved.
</p><p>With Rose hiding from Cal en route, the <a href="/wiki/RMS_Carpathia" title="RMS Carpathia">RMS <i>Carpathia</i></a> takes the survivors to New York City where Rose gives her name as Rose Dawson. Rose says she later read that Cal committed suicide after losing all his money in the <a href="/wiki/Wall_Street_Crash_of_1929" title="Wall Street Crash of 1929">Wall Street Crash of 1929</a>.
</p><p>Back in the present, Lovett decides to abandon his search after hearing Rose's story. Alone on the stern of <i>Keldysh</i>, Rose takes out the Heart of the Ocean — in her possession all along — and drops it into the sea over the wreck site.

Kylo tortures Poe using <a href="/wiki/The_Force" title="The Force">the Force</a> and learns of BB-8.

As they turn back toward Jakku to retrieve BB-8, they are shot down by a First Order <a href="/wiki/Star_Destroyer" title="Star Destroyer">Star Destroyer</a> and crash-land on the planet. Finn survives and assumes Poe died in the crash. He encounters Rey and BB-8, but the First Order tracks them and launches an airstrike. Finn, Rey, and BB-8 flee the planet in the <i><a href="/wiki/Millennium_Falcon" title="Millennium Falcon">Millennium Falcon</a></i>, which they steal from a junkyard.
</p><p>The <i>Falcon</i> is captured by a larger ship piloted by <a href="/wiki/Han_Solo" title="Han Solo">Han Solo</a> and <a href="/wiki/Chewbacca" title="Chewbacca">Chewbacca</a>, looking to reclaim their former vessel.

Snoke questions Kylo's ability to deal with emotions relating to his father, Han Solo; Kylo says Han means nothing to him.
</p><p>The <i>Falcon</i> crew determines BB-8's map is incomplete. Han explains that Luke attempted to rebuild the <a href="/wiki/Jedi" title="Jedi">Jedi Order</a> but exiled himself when an apprentice turned to the dark side, destroyed the temple, and slaughtered the other apprentices. The crew travels to the planet <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Takodana" title="Takodana">Takodana</a> and meets with cantina owner <a href="/wiki/Maz_Kanata" title="Maz Kanata">Maz Kanata</a>, who offers assistance getting BB-8 to the Resistance.

Han, Chewbacca, and Finn are saved by Resistance <a href="/wiki/X-wing_fighter" title="X-wing fighter">X-wing fighters</a> led by Poe, who survived the crash on Jakku. Leia arrives at Takodana with <a href="/wiki/C-3PO" title="C-3PO">C-3PO</a> and reunites with Han and Chewbacca. Meanwhile, Kylo captures Rey and takes her to Starkiller Base, but she resists his mind-reading attempts. Discovering she can use the Force, Rey escapes by using a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Jedi_mind_trick" title="Jedi mind trick">Jedi mind trick</a> on a nearby guard.
</p><p>At the Resistance base on <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/D%27Qar" title="D'Qar">D'Qar</a>, BB-8 finds <a href="/wiki/R2-D2" title="R2-D2">R2-D2</a>, who has been inactive since Luke's disappearance. As Starkiller Base prepares to fire on D'Qar, the Resistance devises a plan to destroy it by attacking a critical facility. Using the <i>Falcon</i>, Han, Chewbacca, and Finn infiltrate the facility, find Rey, and plant explosives. Han confronts Kylo, calling him by his birth name, Ben, and implores him to abandon the dark side. Kylo refuses and kills Han, enraging Chewbacca, who shoots Kylo and sets off the explosives, allowing the Resistance to attack and destroy Starkiller Base.
</p><p>The injured Kylo pursues Finn and Rey to the surface. Kylo defeats Finn in a lightsaber duel, leaving him badly wounded. Rey takes the lightsaber and uses the Force to defeat Kylo before they are separated by a fissure as the planet begins to disintegrate. Snoke orders Hux to evacuate and bring Kylo to him to complete his training. Rey and Chewbacca escape with the unconscious Finn in the <i>Falcon</i>. On D'Qar, the Resistance celebrates while Leia, Chewbacca, and Rey mourn Han's death. R2-D2 awakens and reveals the rest of the map, which Rey follows to the oceanic planet Ahch-To.

In exchange for retrieving the Tesseract,<sup class="reference" id="cite_ref-Tesseract_11-0"><a href="#cite_note-Tesseract-11">[N 2]</a></sup> a powerful energy source of unknown potential, the Other promises Loki an army with which he can subjugate Earth. <a href="/wiki/Nick_Fury" title="Nick Fury">Nick Fury</a>, director of the espionage agency <a href="/wiki/S.H.I.E.L.D." title="S.H.I.E.L.D.">S.H.I.E.L.D.</a>, and his lieutenant Agent <a href="/wiki/Maria_Hill" title="Maria Hill">Maria Hill</a> arrive at a remote research facility during an evacuation, where physicist Dr. <a href="/wiki/Erik_Selvig" title="Erik Selvig">Erik Selvig</a> is leading a research team experimenting on the Tesseract. Agent <a href="/wiki/Phil_Coulson" title="Phil Coulson">Phil Coulson</a> explains that the object has begun radiating an unusual form of energy. The Tesseract suddenly activates and opens a <a href="/wiki/Wormhole" title="Wormhole">wormhole</a>, allowing Loki to reach Earth. Loki takes the Tesseract and uses his scepter to enslave Selvig and a few other agents, including <a href="/wiki/Hawkeye_(comics)" title="Hawkeye (comics)">Clint Barton</a>, to aid him in his getaway.
</p><p>In response to the attack, Fury reactivates the "<a href="/wiki/Avengers_(comics)" title="Avengers (comics)">Avengers Initiative</a>". Agent <a href="/wiki/Black_Widow_(Natasha_Romanova)" title="Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)">Natasha Romanoff</a> is sent to <a href="/wiki/Kolkata" title="Kolkata">Calcutta</a> to recruit <a href="/wiki/Hulk_(comics)" title="Hulk (comics)">Dr. Bruce Banner</a> to trace the Tesseract through its <a href="/wiki/Gamma_ray" title="Gamma ray">gamma radiation</a> emissions.

</p><p>In <a href="/wiki/Stuttgart" title="Stuttgart">Stuttgart</a>, Barton steals <a href="/wiki/Iridium" title="Iridium">iridium</a> needed to stabilize the Tesseract's power while Loki causes a distraction, leading to a brief confrontation with Rogers, Stark, and Romanoff that ends with Loki's surrender. While Loki is being escorted to S.H.I.E.L.D., <a href="/wiki/Thor_(Marvel_Comics)" title="Thor (Marvel Comics)">Thor</a>, his adoptive brother, arrives and frees him, hoping to convince him to abandon his plan and return to Asgard. After a confrontation with Stark and Rogers, Thor agrees to take Loki to S.H.I.E.L.D.'s flying aircraft carrier, the <a href="/wiki/Helicarrier" title="Helicarrier">Helicarrier</a>. Upon arrival, Loki is imprisoned while Banner and Stark attempt to locate the Tesseract.
</p><p>The Avengers become divided, both over how to approach Loki and the revelation that S.H.I.E.L.D. plans to harness the Tesseract to develop weapons as a deterrent against hostile extraterrestrials. As the group argues, Barton and Loki's other possessed agents attack the Helicarrier, disabling one of its engines in flight and causing Banner to transform into the Hulk. Stark and Rogers work to restart the damaged engine, and Thor attempts to stop the Hulk's rampage. Romanoff reluctantly fights Barton, and knocks him unconscious, breaking Loki's mind control. Loki escapes after killing Coulson and ejecting Thor from the airship, while the Hulk falls to the ground after attacking a S.H.I.E.L.D. fighter jet. Fury uses Coulson's death to motivate the Avengers into working as a team. Stark and Rogers realize that for Loki, simply defeating them will not be enough; he needs to overpower them publicly to validate himself as ruler of Earth. Loki uses the Tesseract, in conjunction with a device Selvig built, to open a wormhole above <a href="/wiki/Stark_Tower" title="Stark Tower">Stark Tower</a> to the Chitauri fleet in space, launching his invasion.
</p><p>Rogers, Stark, Romanoff, Barton, and Thor rally in defense of New York City, the wormhole's location. Banner arrives and transforms into the Hulk, and together the Avengers battle the Chitauri while evacuating civilians. The Hulk finds Loki and beats him into submission. Romanoff makes her way to the wormhole generator, where Selvig, freed from Loki's mind control, reveals that Loki's scepter can be used to shut down the generator. Meanwhile, Fury's superiors from the World Security Council attempt to end the invasion by launching a nuclear missile at <a href="/wiki/Midtown_Manhattan" title="Midtown Manhattan">Midtown Manhattan</a>. Stark intercepts the missile and takes it through the wormhole toward the Chitauri fleet. The missile detonates, destroying the Chitauri mothership and disabling their forces on Earth. Stark's suit runs out of power, and he falls back through the wormhole just as Romanoff closes it. Stark goes into freefall, but the Hulk saves him from crashing into the ground. In the aftermath, Thor returns Loki and the Tesseract to Asgard, while Fury expresses confidence that the Avengers will return if and when they are needed.

With God's Eye near <a href="/wiki/Repeater" title="Repeater">telecommunications repeaters</a>, the team tracks down Shaw, who is waiting at a remote factory. Dom, Brian, Nobody and his team attempt to capture Shaw, but are ambushed by Jakande and his men and forced to flee while Jakande obtains God's Eye. At his own request, the injured Nobody is left behind to be evacuated by helicopter while Brian and Dom continue without him. To reduce their disadvantage, the crew returns to Los Angeles to fight Shaw, Jakande and his men. Meanwhile, Brian promises Mia that once they deal with Shaw, he will retire and fully dedicate himself to their family.

Hobbs, seeing the team in trouble, leaves the hospital and destroys the drone with an ambulance. Brian engages Jakande's henchman Kiet and throws him down an elevator shaft before hijacking a signal repeater tower, allowing Ramsey to regain control of God's Eye and shut it down. Dom and Shaw engage in a one-on-one brawl on top of a public parking garage, before Jakande intervenes and attacks them both. Shaw is defeated when part of the parking garage collapses beneath him.
